			<p>Last week, we reported that the popular sci-fi action RPG looter-shooter <strong>Warframe</strong> would make its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-android-mobile-devices-launch-canada-first-digital-extremes/">worldwide debut on <strong>Android</strong> devices on <strong>February 18, 2026,</strong></a> after arriving first in Canada. That was, of course, true at the time. But a last-minute, one-day delay pushed the release back by, well, a day. So as of today, <strong>February 19, 2026,</strong> developer <strong>Digital Extreme's</strong> game is now officially out on Android mobile devices across the globe, and it still has another platform to hit, as it'll be coming to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>This new version of Warframe almost rounds out the full suite of available platforms, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now being the last major platform that you can't find Warframe on. That said, you can play it on Nintendo Switch; there's just no dedicated Switch 2 version yet.</p>



<p>"<em>To bring the Warframe experience to Android players has been a goal for quite some time in our efforts for total accessibility</em>," added <strong>Sheldon Carter</strong>, president of Digital Extremes, in a press release. "<em>This year is set to be a huge milestone for not only Warframe players, but our developers as well. The team is elated to welcome Android players to the full foid of cross-play platforms this year, including <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 soon</strong>. Warframe has become a gravitational force for gathering some of the kindest and most welcoming communities in gaming. Thanks to them, we've built an amusement park full of rides suited for any kind of taste; there's something for everyone to discover and enjoy here. It's going to be a big year, so come join us for the ride!</em>" </p>

<p>Players with Android devices that are running 64-bit Android on an ARM64 processor, Android OS 12.0 or higher, with a minimum of 4GB of RAM, will be able to jump into Warframe right away. Those players who download the game ahead of <strong>March 4, 2026,</strong> will also get the <strong>Cumulus Collection</strong>, which includes special weapon and armour cosmetics and resource boosters as part of their welcome to the game.</p>

			<p>For a good while now, the gaming industry has been grappling with the controversial integration of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">generative Artificial Intelligence</strong> in game development, with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more and more studios and publishers</strong></a> implementing it in a variety of ways. Other studios, however, are still keeping an eye on the technology, only using it as a tool to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ai-support-creativity-developers/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enhance the human touch</strong></a> that makes games special, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda Game Studios</em></strong> with its cautious, hands-off approach.</p>



<p>In a recent appearance on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@KindaFunnyGames">Kinda Funny</a> Gamescast</em></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda’s</em></strong> studio head <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard addressed again the hot topic of AI usage</strong></a> in video game development. While many fear that studios will eventually turn to automation for world-building and narrative, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Howard</strong> clearly stated that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</em></strong> is currently not using the technology to generate game assets or writing.</p>



<p><em>"We're being like incredibly cautious,"</em> <strong>Howard</strong> explained. <em>"Kind of viewing it as a tool, like an analyst. Look at the data in our games. We're not using it to generate anything. I think there's such an element of artistic intention that is essential to what we do and others do."</em></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Howard</strong> likened the development process to that of a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"craftsman,"</strong> arguing that the human touch is what ultimately makes a project special. However, he was highlighted the speed at which the technology is evolving, noting that the industry's stance on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">is frequently changing.</strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It's certainly not a fad,"</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Howard</strong> admitted. <em>"The AI answer now becomes 'ask me in six months.' It changes so much. You can't ignore it in terms of - it's coming, it's changing. Every few months there's a new model, particularly in the tech side with code or productivity."</em></p>



<p>According to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Howard</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda’s</em></strong> current interest in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI</strong> lies in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"big data"</strong> tasks, letting it handle the back-end busywork that traditionally takes a lot of time for actual developers to complete.

<p><em>"We just have so much data in our games… using those systems to like help us with that or validate some things that we're thinking, I think has a lot of use today,"</em> <strong>Howard</strong> concluded.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Thinks ARC Raiders Players are Defeating Matriarchs “Too Early,” Admits it Gave Players “Too Effective Abilities” Against the Giants]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When you start your journey in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, certain ARCs, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-guide-the-most-annoying-arcs-and-how-to-deal-with-them/"><strong>Rocketeers</strong> and <strong>Bastion's</strong></a>, can send a chill down the spine of any new Raider. You'll eventually learn how to take these machines down, but there's always something bigger waiting in the wings, and in this new extraction shooter, that 'something bigger' is the <strong>Matriarchs</strong>. </p>



<p>They're the closest thing ARC Raiders has to a boss encounter. You can't take them down yourself (not without some serious luck and know-how), and they're arguably the most deadly machines you'll face as far as the game's PvE elements are concerned. But that hasn't stopped players from figuring out how to take them down, and how to do it very, very quickly, especially when an entire server is charging the six-legged giants. </p>



<p>According to <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, however, that's not how fights against Matriarchs are supposed to go. At least, not when you're still early in your in-game journey. They're meant to be tough encounters that you'll struggle with, even with mid-tier gear. But since when have players done something precisely the way game designers intended them to?</p>



<p>As Embark Studios' design director, <strong>Virgil Watkins</strong>, admits in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-admits-arc-raiders-bosses-are-dying-too-fast-because-theyre-not-intended-for-the-full-server-to-go-up-against-and-we-gave-players-too-effective-abilities/">PC Gamer</a>, working with that assumption is on the team at Embark for making players "<em>too effective</em>" in the early game with the kinds of abilities they have at their disposal.</p>



<p>"<em>Even though [Queens and Matriarchs are] huge and deadly, they're not intended for the full server to go up against and get equally rewarded. It is meant to be, you know, a couple of dedicated squads, maybe working together while also dealing with other players,</em>" Watkins said. "<em>That's definitely on us to an extent...I think we gave players <strong>too effective abilities to take down these things too early</strong>. So they were tuned more for what I would call mid-game gear.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, this doesn't mean you can expect a future update where Matriarchs and Queens get a huge buff. That might be part of the solution for Embark, but it's not the whole picture. The team would rather have a solution that addresses the different playstyles they're seeing from Raiders to better address the problem.</p>



<p>"<em>Do we reward the people who might pick their moment well, and go get some scraps from part of the fight and then sneak away?...Are you going to be the guy who capitalizes at the end of the fight because everyone's worn down and out of ammo, or are you the one who's trying to pull everyone together and have the fight on even terms?"</em></p>



<p>It's not just these boss encounters that Embark is looking to tweak. The <strong>Hidden Bunker</strong> and <strong>Locked Gate</strong> activities are also something the studio wants to change, because it's noticed that players will just wait by the doors, waiting for them to be opened by someone else, rather than go out and properly engage with the challenge of crossing the map to get the appropriate keys themselves.</p>



<p>"<em>When we built them, we had an idealized way we hoped people would engage. And then, you know, as players always do, they find this sort of meta throughline,</em>" Watkins said. "<em>That's where we can go look at those existing map conditions...it's about us trying to keep the spirit of those, but adjust the mechanics."</em></p>



<p>Essentially, if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of players signing on to play ARC Raiders every day, expect to see some changes to how the game operates going forward, with the game seemingly leaning towards becoming even more challenging. Hopefully, Embark is able to keep the game fun and engaging without overdoing it.</p>



<p>And if you're a player who took severe advantage of the coins duplication glitch, you can probably <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/">expect a suspension coming your way</a> in the near future.</p>
