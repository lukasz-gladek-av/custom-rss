			<p>Unreal Engine was considered for Halo Infinite, but developer 343 Industries eventually went with its Slipspace Engine again due to a few issues, including how the engine would have impacted the vision for the game.</p>



<p>As reported in a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming">Rebs Gaming</a> recently discovered an official Halo Infinite documentary created in 2017 to reframe 343 Industries' vision for the game and pitch to Xbox leadership for funding on the Vimeo profile page of a former 343I developer. The documentary, which has been made private following its discovery, features a presentation given by studio head Chris Lee revealing that, as it has been rumored a while back, 343 Industries indeed considered using Unreal Engine for the latest entry in the iconic series. In May 2017, the developer visited The Coalition, spending two days presenting their findings on the Unreal Engine before deciding on which engine to use the following month. This was a tumultuous time at the studio, as a former developer revealed that the game's art team threatened to quit if leadership didn't investigate a possible switch to Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the findings were more favorable for the Slipspace Engine, as the Unreal Engine proved to be better in some areas, but the studio's proprietary engine was considered more powerful in others. In addition, rebuilding the foundation would have taken two years, and an engine switch would have impacted the vision. A vote with leadership was also held, and 85% chose Slipspace over the Unreal Engine, which is the engine 343 Industries ultimately used for Halo Infinite.</p>

<p>Although 343 Industries, now <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-has-multiple-projects-on-the-way-made-with-unreal-engine-5/">Halo Studios</a>, ended up going with Unreal Engine 5 for the development of the next entry in the series, up until late 2022, the Slipspace Engine still seemed to have some life left in it, as it is rumored it would have powered a direct sequel to Halo Infinite. With the change of leadership on September 22 also came a change of plans, and thus, the Slipspace Engine was replaced by Unreal Engine 5 as the engine that will power future entries in the series, which may include a remake of the first entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/">Combat Evolved.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-hands-on/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-offers-fun-mouse-clicks-flimsy-camera-tricks.1250832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> came and went without all that much noise, delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/">solid, if not exactly (mini)game-changing entry</a> in the long-running series. So, the announcement that Jamboree would be one of the first Nintendo Switch titles to receive a major paid <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> upgrade came as a bit of a surprise to some. But perhaps the laboriously-titled Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV shouldn’t have been <em>that</em> unexpected, as Nintendo is basically using the upgraded game as a showcase for the Switch 2’s new features and peripherals, such as Joy-Con 2 mouse controls and the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera.</p>



<p>Does the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Party Jamboree take the festivities to the next level? Or is it okay to leave this party in the past? Boogie on down for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the title screen, you'll find most of Super Mario Party Jamboree's new Switch 2 content by selecting Jamboree TV, which includes a couple of new game modes that provide quick access to the game's roughly 20 new minigames.</p>



<p>The “Bowser Live” mode serves up minigames that require the use of the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera and the console’s new built-in microphone. Basically, two teams compete in a trio of camera or microphone-focused minigames, and whoever does best over the course of all three, wins. The loser gets roasted alive by Bowser. Pretty simple.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Switch 2 camera is basically functional, I suppose. Simple minigames that involve doing things like punching upwards to bash a coin block or pulling various basic poses Simon-Says-style <em>do</em> work, but the experience isn’t overly thrilling. I’m not providing my own screenshots for privacy purposes, but Nintendo’s screenshots showing what people look like when captured in game are very much a best-case scenario. I don’t know if conditions in the room I was playing in weren’t right, but the images of myself and my fellow players captured by the game were very low quality. The camera/game is also bad at finding the edges of a person – often large chunks of background would be included or, alternatively, arms and legs would be cut off. The game is also not particularly good with players of various sizes, as my family members, who range from around 4 feet to 6 feet tall, all had to stand at odd varying distances from the camera.</p>



<p>Minigames based around the mic are similarly functional, but also not that exciting, and background talk and other extraneous noise easily confuses the game. Ultimately, Bowser Live was good for a few chuckles, particularly when my seven-year-old discovered he could stick his butt into other players’ sections of the screen, but nobody who experienced the heady 2010s era of Kinect and the PlayStation Eye are going to find anything here terribly impressive or innovative.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Significantly more successful is the new “Carnival Coaster” mode, which revolves around the new Joy-Con 2’s mouse functionality. Carnival Coaster asks players to team up to get to the end of one of five different on-rail rides. You have a limited amount of time to reach the end, but successfully shooting down groups of enemies will net you bonus time. You'll also periodically play a mouse-controlled minigame, with further time being added to the clock if you do well.</p>



<p>While the shooting aspect of Carnival Coaster mode is quite simple, it works well enough, and the minigames you play are almost all winners -- some of the best in all of Jamboree. While some of these minigames are quite simple, asking you to pluck and sort mail into folders or scoop ice cream cones, others throw in a literal twist as you use mouse and motion controls simultaneously to, say, stack and manipulate blocks and other items to build the highest tower.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, the Switch 2’s built-in features bring some added functionality to the standard Mario Party experience as well. Players can capture a live image of their face to give the party a personal touch and GameChat has the potential to make online games a little more rowdy. GameShare support also means both Switch 2 and OG Switch owners can test Jamboree out with you, even if they don't own the game. Meanwhile, Jamboree’s resolution has also been bumped up (it already ran at 60fps on the OG Switch), which is nice, although I don’t know if many people play Mario Party for its graphical fidelity.</p>



<p>With all these additions, the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Party Jamboree is probably the most feature- and content-rich entry in the series to date, which is good, because it’s also the most expensive game in the series at a full $80 (those who own the Switch version can upgrade for $20). Whether you’re willing to pony up that much to party hardy is up to you.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>A Sometimes-Stimulating Switch 2 Showcase</strong></p>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is an interesting showcase of Nintendo’s latest hardware features, for better or worse. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera feels like a late-to-the-party retread of a style of gameplay that went out of fashion a decade ago, but pretty much any mode and minigame that relies on Joy-Con 2 mouse controls works out quite well. Nintendo’s asking price may be hard to justify for some, but if you’re looking for a single product that shows off all of the Switch 2’s unique abilities, this multi-talented upgrade may be worth an invite.</p>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV launches on July 24. As mentioned, those who already own the Switch version of Jamboree can upgrade for $20 or you can buy the original game and upgrade together for $80.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forza-horizon-5-is-2025%E2%80%99s-best-selling-playstation-5-game-so-far-outselling-major-first-party-titles.1250802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a twist that no one could have predicted a few years ago, the best-selling game released on PlayStation 5 in 2025 so far is Forza Horizon 5, a game published by Microsoft.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true">Alinea Analytics</a>, the fifth entry in the series by Playground Games, which was released on PlayStation 5 this March, has surpassed 3 million copies on Sony's system, overtaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which sits at 2.9 million copies, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which sold 2 million, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which sold 1.4 million copies, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which sold 1.3 million units.</p>



<p>While selling 3 million copies in just a few months, by itself, is a very good indication of how well Forza Horizon 5 is doing on PlayStation 5, the Microsoft game seems to be doing even better on the system, looking at other data, as it is also outselling other first-party exclusives. According to the data provided by Alinea, Forza Horizon 5 sold 2 million copies on PlayStation 5 in 25 days, while other first-party exclusives like Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Astro Bot failed to achieve similar results. The second entry in the Kojima Production series only sold 1 million copies in 25 days, while last year's GOTY only passed two million copies sold in three months. As such, it's becoming clearer how Microsoft's decision to go multiplatform has been the right one to offset low sales on Xbox systems and stagnating Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about this excellent racing game by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/killer-inn-cbt-test-this-weekend-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killer-inn-is-hosting-a-closed-beta-test-this-weekend-on-steam.1250763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Square Enix and Tactic Studios have announced that the multiplayer murder mystery game KILLER INN will host a Closed Beta Test this weekend on Steam. The CBT is set to begin on Friday, July 25, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time and will be live until Monday, July 28, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time. Access can be requested <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the store page</a>.</p>



<p>The developers warned that this is first and foremost a test meant to verify how the servers hold up when a large number of players join the game at the same time. This version also lacks the tutorials that will be available when the game actually launches in the near future.</p>



<p>KILLER INN is an asymmetrical competitive game where players are divided into two teams. The larger group (16) of players is called Lambs and faces off against a smaller group (8) of Wolves. Each team must reduce the other team's ranks through combat—the first team to eliminate all of the other team's members wins. The difference is that the Wolves know who their teammates are from the start, but the Lambs don't know which of their teammates may actually be a Wolf.</p>



<p>Whenever a Wolf kills a Lamb, at least one clue is left behind. Lambs must gather these clues to figure out the Wolves' identities. When coming across a corpse, players must ensure to pick up any clues on it, as this is an essential aspect of the game. To survive, players will need weapons and armor. They can get them either by opening chests with tokens earned after completing quests for the castle's staff members in the castle, or saving up gold to buy items from the in-game shop.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-mode-having-been-built-from-scratch-allowed-the-addition-of-cut-content.1250760/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles' Classic mode, which will allow players to experience the original game released back in 1997 on the first PlayStation, has been built from scratch, as the original source code has been lost, but this allowed the development team to add content that was cut from the original release.</p>



<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/21/the-secrets-behind-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-makeover/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the game's director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed once again that the Classic mode, which attempts to recreate the original as faithfully as possible, has been created from scratch, as the original master data and source code have been lost. As Maehiro-san highlighted, back in the day, developers didn't have effective resource management tools as they do today, and games were essentially developed by overwriting the previous code every time a bug was fixed or a language option was added.</p>



<p>As the Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Classic mode is meant to provide an experience faithful to the original, the development team also had the option of emulating the original, but doing so would have prevented them from making granular improvements. Eventually, it was decided that the best option would be to rebuild the original game from scratch. This choice paid off in a big way, as recreating the original experience gave the team a solid foundation upon which to create the Enhanced version, and add features that were cut from the original, such as character dialogues playing during battles under certain conditions that will help flesh out story character after they have joined Ramza's party. This is, in my opinion, a great addition, as it was sad to see this characters slide in the background and essentially become like generic units.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles will include some new features not seen in the original, it may not be the definitive edition some were waiting for, as tt won't feature the additional content seen in the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile release is based. <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">The decision</a> to not include this extra content was made because the remaster's main goal was to be as faithful to the original as possible.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on September 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting its Q1 2025 financial results</a>, Ubisoft revealed that Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to perform well. After reaching 3 million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of March</a>, the game has now surpassed 5 million unique players, who have collectively performed 2 billion stealth kills, traveled 1 billion kilometers, and petted 38 million animals. However, the publisher's quarterly financial results still reported lower than anticipated net bookings, mostly due to issues with Rainbow Six Siege, as noted in the below statement by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot:</p>



<p><em>The first quarter delivered mixed results. On the positive side, Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivered on its expectations, with now more than 5 million unique players since its launch, and Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth. However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft also noted that the other two causes for the lower net bookings include a 'partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2 and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact'.</p>



<p>Guillemot then added that Ubisoft will continue creating so-called Creative Houses. The hope is that these business units will boost creative vision and business performance. The first one is, of course, the subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year, which is set to oversee the Rainbow Six, Far Cry, and Assassin's Creed franchise. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> recently, it will be led by Christopher Derennes and Yves Guillemot's own son.</p>



<p>As for the Assassin's Creed Shadows expansion, Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft only reiterated that it's coming in their fiscal Q2 and will offer more than 10 hours of new content, as well as a new weapon, skills, and abilities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it might launch as early as September, although if that's truly the case, an official announcement will have to be made soon by the publisher.</p>
