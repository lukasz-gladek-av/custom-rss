			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention is going live on December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-itemization-monster-combat-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after several weeks of testing on the Public Test Realm</a>.</p>



<p>The game's eleventh season introduces 'evolved monsters', as they were described by the studio, increasing the challenge players will face when playing the latest installment in the studio's acclaimed hack-and-slash action RPG series. Monster AI and affixes have been overhauled: enemies react more dynamically, elites and champions hit harder and come with over twenty new affixes, champion packs are formalized, and packs clump less. These changes apply across all Diablo IV content, including Nightmare Dungeons.</p>



<p>Blizzard also releases the long-awaited itemization overhaul with Diablo IV: Season of Intervention:</p>



<ul>
<li>Non‑unique items now drop with four base affixes instead of three, and Sanctification (channeling Angelic power into gear) becomes a final, irreversible upgrade that can add a bonus legendary power, Greater Affix, special Sanctification affixes, and 5–25 extra Quality while locking the item from further modification; Sanctification, which occasionally can even make items indestructible, is earned via Heavenly Anvils and Heavenly Sigils at higher tiers.</li>



<li>Tempering now lets players pick a specific affix from a recipe instead of rolling randomly; items get only one tempered affix, but charges are infinite, and Ancestral items can occasionally upgrade the tempered affix into a Greater Affix. </li>



<li>Masterworking uses a new Quality (0–25) stat that increases base damage/armor/resists and all affix values by 1% per Quality level; Masterworking adds 2–5 Quality per upgrade, with costs scaling by current Quality, and a final Capstone Bonus roll at max Quality that boosts one random affix (Greater included) by 50%.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>As previously announced, Blizzard has also overhauled the defense stats to equalize effective Health across classes better and builds. Diablo IV: Season of Intervention introduces rating‑based Armor and Resistances (with diminishing returns and Armor now reducing all damage types), a new Physical Damage Resistance, and a unified Toughness stat that summarizes effective HP against each damage type and can be compared on item tooltips. Many skills and Paragon nodes that granted generic damage reduction now give multiplicative bonuses to Armor, or all Resistances; Fortify is redesigned from DR into an extra Life reservoir that slowly heals the player character at the cost of Fortify.</p>



<p>Potions have been redesigned as well. They're now reduced to a base stack of 4, but now provide an instant 35% max‑life heal, and passively regenerate one charge every 30 seconds. Life on Hit, Life Regeneration, Life on Kill, and Healing % are buffed and more available, potion tier upgrades are removed, and Welcome Back Booster handling is adjusted for future seasons.</p>



<p>There are significant tweaks to the Season Journey, too. Season Rank is replacing Renown on the Seasonal Realm; players advance through the ranks by completing objectives and a Capstone Dungeon at each tier, earning Skill points, Paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, cosmetics, Heavenly Sigils, and other rewards. The Eternal Realm, on the other hand, keeps traditional Renown with some adjustments. </p>



<p>Five Capstone Dungeons (Vault of the Crucible, Hellish Descent, Enclave of Darkness, Den of the Apostate, Breach of Sin) have now been built into an all-new system aimed at challenging progress through the many difficulty tiers, from Hard through Torment III, as the character grows in power. Despite Capstone Dungeons stating a suggested level at which to attempt them, their difficulty does not actually scale with the character's current level.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GRZOQEKCPXRQ1764270043784-scaled.webp"></a></figure>



<p>Story-wise, Diablo IV: Season of Intervention features the angel Hadriel aiding Sanctuary's heroes. In Seasonal Realms, players follow his light in towns to start the seasonal questline. The Lesser Evils each invade a specific endgame mode: Duriel takes over Helltide, Belial corrupts The Pit, Andariel infests the Kurast Undercity, and Azmodan becomes both a permanent world boss and a summonable challenge in Hawezar with variant powers from the others; their minions gain themed affixes and visual readability updates.</p>



<p>Killing each Lesser Evil unlocks two Divine Gifts tied to that boss. Gifts have a Reward track plus Corrupted and Purified socket options that change difficulty and benefits for activities like Helltide, The Pit, Undercity, and World Bosses (for example, more socketables from Pangs of Duriel but harsher maggot threats, or extra Tower/Pit upgrades in exchange for lethal Belial eye beams). Divine Gifts level up as players farm their associated content, and Purified slots for each Lesser Evil unlock at specific Season Rank milestones (Duriel IV, Andariel VI, Azmodan VIII, Belial X).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, in Patch 2.5.2 (tentatively slated for early 2026), the multi‑stage timed dungeon The Tower and its Leaderboards return in Beta: Tower difficulty tiers will unlock independently, some problematic bosses will be removed, and class and party‑specific leaderboards will track clears by tier, time, date, platform, and mode (Normal/Hardcore) with filters for friends and clans.</p>



<p>Diablo IV will get its second expansion, following 2024's Vessel of Hatred, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at some point in 2026</a>. The original plan was <a href="https://wccftech.com/annual-diablo-4-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to release annual expansions</a>, but it ultimately proved unfeasible for Blizzard. </p>

			<p>Welcome to Orsterra! <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Octopath Traveler 0</em> can be overwhelming at first with its new Town-Building mechanics, 8-person parties, and custom protagonist. This guide will help you with the best advice to enjoy the first few hours of the adventure and get started on this epic journey.</p>



<p>For a complete list of all our guides, be sure to check out our <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/octopath-traveler-0-all-guides-walkthroughs-and-beginner-tips-hub/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Octopath Traveler 0 Complete Guides and Walkthrough Hub</strong>.</a></p>

<h2 id="h-pick-warrior-as-your-first-job">Pick Warrior as Your First Job</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Warrior.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Warrior Job is the best early-game choice for beginners</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While each Job has its own uses, the Warrior stands out as the best starting Job, especially if Octopath Traveler 0 is your first entry in the series. Besides offering solid power and defense and a great selection of offense-oriented skills, the Warrior can wield Swords and Spears, two weapon options that won't be available for your party for some time due to the characters that can be recruited in the first few hours of the adventure.</p>



<p>Additionally, many of the enemies you will encounter in the first chapters of the Master of Power, Master of Wealth and Master of Fame quests are weak against Swords, so having a Warrior capable of taking advantage of this weakness will prove to be invaluable as you get acquainted with the game's mechanics.</p>



<h2 id="h-pick-scholar-as-your-second-job">Pick Scholar as Your Second Job</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Scholar.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Scholar works great as a secondary Job for your protagonist in the early game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Compared to the Warrior, the Scholar Job is not a great starter Job, but it's a great secondary Job. While the Boost system cannot be used to increase the number of times an elemental spell can hit enemies, these properties are just as important to Break enemies.</p>



<p>As Octopath Traveler 0 allows you to switch the main character's Jobs right from the main menu (Skills - Protagonist's Job ), you can easily adapt to the enemies you are facing in a specific area by switching between Warrior and Scholar as required, letting the other starting characters cover the other weapon-based weaknesses and the Ice and Dark elements the Scholar cannot hit.</p>



<p>Unlocking a second Job is also very easy. All you need to do is learn three skills with the Job you have unlocked last. So, to have the Scholar as your second job, all you have to do is learn three skills for the Warrior for a total of 430 JP (30 JP for the first skill, 100 for the second, 300 for the third), regardless of which skill is unlocked.</p>



<p>As a side bonus, the Scholar's first Support Skill, Study Foe, also reveals one undiscovered weakness for any enemy at the start of battle, making this Job a great one to run with certain party configurations.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Quests-Menu-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Quests menu comes with some really useful features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Quests section in the main menu is really useful for a couple of reasons. Its primary purpose is to list all of the available quests, but it has some additional functions that make it even more useful.</p>



<ul>
<li>By pressing the Cross (PlayStation), A (Xbox) / B (Nintendo Switch) button while a quest is highlighted, you can not only track any quest but also fast travel to its location, cutting down the time needed to start it.</li>



<li>Besides listing all the known available quests, the Quests menu also lists available quests that you haven't discovered yet. Its icon also indicates if it is a regular side quest or a Traveler focused quest that will allow you to recruit a new party member.</li>
</ul>



<p>For these reasons, always check the Quests menu whenever you have completed a main story quest. This allows you to engage with side content and help you achieve completion quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-always-use-path-actions-whenever-possible">Always use Path Actions Whenever Possible</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Path-Actions-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Path Actions should be used every time you reach a new town</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Path Actions return in Octopath Traveler 0, and they are more useful than ever before. By pressing the Square (PlayStation)/X (Xbox)/Y (Nintendo Switch) button near any applicable NPC, it is possible to Inquire to learn more about them, Entice them to purchase or obtain items after a fight, Hire them as Combat Helpers or Invite them to live in Wishvale. </p>



<p>As these NPCs sometimes offer some rather useful items such as Masteries that can be used to equip skills to characters and powerful gear, you will want to use Path Action interactions on every possible character. Depending on your current level of Power, Wealth and Fame, your interactions may fail and may force you to restore your reputation at a nearby Tavern, but if you handle this properly and don't attempt interactions that have a high failure chance, you can take great advantage of these mechanics at all times during the adventure</p>



<h2 id="h-be-efficient-in-battle-to-get-amazing-rewards">Be Efficient in Battle To Get Amazing Rewards</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Battle-Rewards.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Performing well in battle is rewarded with some great bonuses</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 rewards your combat performance by providing EXP, JP and Leaf (money) bonuses depending on how well you do.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Condition</strong></td><td><strong>Reward</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Overkill/Break</strong></td><td>EXP Bonus</td></tr><tr><td><strong>1-Turn Kill</strong></td><td>JP Bonus</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No Damage Win</strong></td><td>Leaf Bonus</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As such, you should always look into completing battles after breaking enemies in a single turn. This is difficult to achieve against elite enemies and bosses, but if you do so every random encounter against mobs, the rewards will pile up, make your characters stronger, and allow you to engage more with the game's Job and Mastery systems.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-sleep-on-food">Don't Sleep on Food </h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Food.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Food can be way more useful than regula</em><em>r</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> items</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although items are as important as ever to restore HP and SP and heal status ailments quickly, you really shouldn't discount how important Food is. These items, which can be cooked from the Tavern in Wishvale, provide a variety of bonuses for a set number of turns, ranging from stat increases to automatic HP and SP restoration. As the selection of available Food increases as you play the game, make sure to check out at the Tavern what can be cooked to gain a sound advantage against all sorts of enemies.</p>

			<p>Octopath Traveler 0 is the third main entry in the series that launched the popular HD-2D visual style, combining high-quality sprites with 3D environments. However, the game based on the mobile game Champions of the Continent is more than a great-looking game, as its web of interconnected mechanics, in conjunction with its great story, makes for a very engaging experience.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 is a traditional Japanese role-playing game where the player takes control of a custom character embarking in a journey all over Orsterra (the world of the original Octopath Traveler) to defeat three powerful villains - The Master of Power Tytos, The Master of Wealth Herminia and The Master of Fame Auguste - and save the world.</p>



<p>Compounding the game's traditional traversal mechanics is a turn-based combat system that pits up to eight party members against all sorts of enemies. Breaking the enemy using attacks with specific properties and boosting the efficacy of regular attacks and skills are the core mechanics upon which combat is based.</p>



<p>Octopath Traveler 0 also introduces town-building mechanics that let players influence the restoration of Wishvale, and unlock important upgrades via new facilities, including a monster arena.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 is the first entry in the series to feature a single main character as opposed to the eight characters of past games. This character can be fully customized at the beginning of the game.</p>

<p>The Octopath series' signature Job System returns in Octopath Traveler 0, but with some twists.

<p>Octopath Traveler 0 employs a classic turn-based combat system where the player and the enemy take turns to attack, use skills and items, cast spells, or defend.
