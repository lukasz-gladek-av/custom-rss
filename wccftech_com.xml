			<p>Gaijin Entertainment has not one but two games enhanced for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's newly released PS5 Pro console</a> at launch: the first-person tactical multiplayer WWII shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/military-online-shooter-enlisted-open-beta-is-now-available-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enlisted</a>, originally released in 2020, and the vehicle combat multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/cross-play-between-pc-ps4-xb1-is-finally-out-in-war-thunder-after-over-a-year-of-talks-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">War Thunder</a>, which has been continuously updated since 2013.</p>
<p>To learn how both games have been improved to leverage the most powerful console hardware currently on the market, we interviewed Gergo Horvath, a Graphics Programmer on Gaijin's proprietary Dagor Engine for over four years. Horvath admitted that the PlayStation 5 Pro's improvement over the PS5 is smaller than that seen in the previous generation between PS4 Pro and PS4, but he believes the console achieves its goal anyway, mainly thanks to PSSR, which he reckons is superior to AMD FSR and on the same level of NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>While the ~45% faster rendering is impressive alone, the real game changer, in my opinion, is the addition of the Machine Learning Architecture that made PSSR possible. By being able to render in lower resolutions and yet get the same visual fidelity we can free up a tremendous amount of resources. This tech will be especially useful when paired with ray tracing.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>I’d say the difference between the PS5 Pro and the PS5 is less substantial compared to the difference between the last-gen console and its Pro counterpart. In the PS5 Pro, we have little to no change in CPU performance, and while the GPU got a nice boost, the difference is much less significant: the PS4 Pro had more than doubled the nominal power of its predecessor's GPU (in terms of TFLOPS). With that being said, back then, the goal was to achieve 4K gaming. This time, it looks like the main focus was on providing substantially better ray tracing. Goal achieved in both cases.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game? Can you share specific details on the target resolution and frame rate and whether there will be multiple modes to choose from?</strong></p>
<p>For the PS5 Pro’s release of Enlisted, we have switched from a fixed resolution to using dynamic resolution together with upscaling techniques for both the Base and the Pro version of the console to make sure we have a stable frame rate at all times while the internal rendering resolution is automatically adjusted. This made 4K@120FPS gaming possible for PS5 Pro players. On the PS5 Pro, this will mean higher rendering resolution, which will lead to more detail rich and sharper visuals. With the faster memory, we could use higher resolution textures and better looking global illumination, which together enhance details even further.</p>
<p>Upscaling from the internal rendering resolution to the display’s resolution is taken care of by our own TAAU implementation for Base PS5, but we are using PSSR for the Pro version. PSSR, of course, does a better job. For the PS5 Pro’s release of War Thunder we’ll offer the opportunity to play the game at 4K@120FPS resolution from day one. More visual updates will follow with the next major update release in a week, and even more are under development.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to other upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>We’re currently using it in Enlisted. During development and playtesting, we’ve found PSSR to be on par with NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS, the other two ML based super resolution methods. While in my opinion PSSR produces less blur, ghosting, and unwanted flicker compared to AMD FSR. These technologies are constantly improving, so I find it impressive that the first version of PSSR is already head-to-head with other more mature solutions.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say we are about 75% to being maxed-out for Enlisted. We’ll give our estimate for War Thunder later when we’ll have all our visual updates implemented.</p>
<p><strong>The big controversy about Sony's new console is pricing. Based on the hardware, do you believe it to be fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>It’s always up to the gamers to decide whether the console pricing is up to their expectations or not. Calculating a “fair price” by assessing hardware alone does not make much sense, as gamers usually make their decision based on new experiences offered by a device, and not based on the hardware alone.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-unrevealed-monsters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Additional information on the monsters, quests, and more that Monster Hunter Wilds will feature at launch may have been revealed thanks to the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-struggles-1080p-rtx-4070/">open beta</a> client.</p>
<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1glgv4p/brand_new_datamine_discoveries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TheNadei</a> reported that a friend of theirs took a good look at the beta client's files, discovering information that has yet to be revealed officially, including a list of monsters, the potential total number of quests, and more. <strong>There will be spoilers from here, so do not continue reading if you don't want any surprises spoiled.</strong></p>
<p>According to the information discovered by TheNadei, Monster Hunter Wilds should feature at least 30 monsters, including mainstays like Rathian and Rathalos, and some that haven't appeared in the series in a while, like Blangonga and Lagiacrus, as well as variations of monsters that recently appeared in the series like Anjanath and Odogaron. Additionally, the game should feature at least 164 quests at launch, with number 164 possibly being the final boss quest as it rewards the hunter with a massive amount of points.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds open beta client also features new information on maps, which include 5 normal maps complete with NPCs and a special one, and weather states, which include sand storms, heavy rain, heatwaves, and blizzards. Interestingly enough, the open beta client also features data for breakable parts, which include antennae and trunks, suggesting that a Neopteron or Carapaceon monster could be in the game alongside an elephant-like monster like Gammoth.</p>
<p>As all of this information was discovered in the beta client, there's a good chance it is incomplete, and Monster Hunter Wilds will feature more monsters or other surprises when it launches in a few months. Still, it definitely looks like hunters will have plenty to do already at release.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th worldwide.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro brings considerable visual and performance improvements in several titles, including Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 remake, Demon's Souls, and others.</p>
<p>In the tests conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel/videos">Brazil Pixel</a>, the latest two entries in the CAPCOM survival horror series powered by the RE Engine show considerable performance improvements. Resident Evil Village, for example, runs at locked 120 frames per second in HFR without ray tracing at 1080p resolution, which is quite impressive to see on a console in a relatively recent game. The Resident Evil 4 remake, on the other hand, doesn't reach the same locked 120 FPS frame rate but does run close to 100 FPS in Frame Rate Mode without ray tracing, which is still quite impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Village - PS5 PRO - High Frame Rate - Patch 1.210.0 - Performance - FPS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4w5irKp-34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil 4 - PS5 PRO - High Frame Rate - Patch 1.400.0 - Performance - FPS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NgVzXqZJ0Tk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>In a Tekken 8 quick test, Brazil Pixel also showed how the raw power of the PlayStation 5 Pro can boost games that use dynamic resolution even without a dedicated patch. Unfortunately, not every game can take full advantage of the console's power, such as Rise of the Ronin, which still suffers from performance issues even on the new system.</p>

<p>Among the games that were updated to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's power and features is also the Demon's Souls remake by Bluepoint Games. The recently released PS5 Pro patch introduces material-displaced contact shadows for all dynamic lights and 4K, 60 FPS support via PSSR upscaling, which makes one of the best-looking PS5 games to date look even better. These improvements can be seen in action in the comparison video below, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>.</p>
