			<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1905268079958904991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via social media channels that Assassin's Creed Shadows has now surpassed three million players. They also shared the following milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅2nd highest Day 1 sales revenue in Assassin's Creed franchise history</li>
<li>✅Biggest Ubisoft Day 1 ever on PlayStation Digital Store</li>
<li>✅Best community ever, with over 40 Million hours already played</li>
</ul>
<p>This follows the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">becoming a million seller on launch day</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching two million units on March 22</a>. Since then, we also learned that Assassin's Creed Shadows was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-biggest-physical-game-of-the-year-in-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best retail launch of 2025 in the United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The game has undoubtedly been well-received. On Steam, the average review verdict is 'Very Positive' (82%). Critics were also quite positive; the game was rated 8.7 out of 10 here on Wccftech in the review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Everything considered, Assassin's Creed Shadows is undoubtedly a solid open-world role-playing game and one of the best entries in the series in a long time. It brings back the stealth gameplay that made the series what it is and seamlessly combines it with the combat-focused experience seen in Valhalla. While the content bloat is still as annoying as ever, the solid narrative, engaging gameplay, and one of the most beautiful renditions of Feudal Japan ever released make it a game worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>The game's success came at an absolutely critical time for Ubisoft. Earlier today, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the rumored decision to form a new subsidiary that will take control of Ubisoft's most successful franchises: Far Cry, Rainbow Six, and Assassin's Creed itself. The strong performance of Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly allowed Ubisoft to be stronger in the negotiations. Just like the rumors had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a>, Tencent has a 25% minority stake in the new subsidiary following a cash investment of €1.16 billion.</p>
