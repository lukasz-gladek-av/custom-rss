			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> remastered the original 2014 puzzle classic and its Road to Gehenna expansion with an Unreal Engine 5 upgrade, but it also went further than that. It included a whole new expansion called In the Beginning, which adds another 18 puzzles to solve on the original game and its first DLC release.</p>
<p>Narratively, In the Beginning is a prequel to the events of the first game, but what makes it special is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 out of the 18 puzzles</a> were made in collaboration with members of the community who had been making their own puzzles for the last 11 years.</p>
<p>The result is an expansion that is so tough, the puzzles included with In the Beginning are earning the reputation as being some of the most challenging to solve in the entire series.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to solve the Blocker puzzle in the expansion. If you just want a hint, then all I'll say is to leave the jammer alone. It's already doing everything you need it to do. Keep reading if you want the full solution.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Blocker Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Get the second connector</h3>
<p>When you enter the puzzle area and look around, it won't take you long to deduce that you need a second connector to deactivate the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. It's easy to assume that the jammer you see on the right side of the area deactivating a shield between the two spaces is part of the solve. As I said in the hint, you don't need it at all, and you can leave it where it is, keeping the shield in the wall between the two sides of the puzzle area down.</p>
<p>Instead, what you need to do first, is get the hexahedron.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk forward when entering the puzzle area and grab the connector (C1). Connect it to the red laser generator and the red node that sits just behind a fan that will launch you to a platform in the top-right corner of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When the laser has activated the fan, launch yourself onto the elevated platform and grab the hexahedron. Jump back down to the ground.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedron in front of the fan. Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the node behind the fan, the blue laser generator, and the blue node on the other side of the puzzle area, behind a wall.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place C1 down on top of the hexahedron. Your laser pattern should look like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Step in front of the blue laser generator so that the red laser can connect to the node that will activate the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When it launches into the air, the blue lasers will connect instead of the red, activating the blue node on the far left side of the puzzle area. That node simultaneously turns off the shield blocking the second connector (C2) and turns on a fan that will push it out onto the ground, letting you pick it up.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fair warning, the hexahedron won't fly for very long with C1 on top of it, so you might have to try this twice, as it's possible for the C2 to get stuck before making it onto the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Solve the puzzle</h3>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Gather C1, C2 and the hexahedron together.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node behind the fan and the red node on the opposite side of the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and use the fan to launch yourself, with C2 in hand, to the elevated platform. Connect C2 to the blue laser generator and the blue node to fully deactivate the shield blocking the path to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the ground, walk over to the tetromino and claim your prize.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-won-the-ftc-appeal-that-still-challenged-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's taken nearly two years, but the FTC appeal against Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the Northern District of California's decision to block the Activision Blizzard deal with a preliminary injunction is concluded, and Microsoft has won once again.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/microsoft-wins-ftc-appeal-challenging-69-bln-activision-blizzard-deal-2025-05-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the three-judge panel of San Francisco's 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/movayzarnva/FTC%20v%20Microsoft%20-%20CA9%20-%2020250507.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled</a> in favor of Microsoft. More specifically, they decreed that the district court had applied the correct legal standards when <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-beats-ftcs-request-for-preliminary-injunction-to-block-activision-blizzard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it ruled in July 2023</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>First, pertaining to the console market, the panel agreed with the district court that the FTC failed to sufficiently show that Microsoft would foreclose or partially foreclose rivals after the merger either by making the popular game Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox console or by releasing only an inferior version of the game for Sony’s rival PlayStation. </em></li>
<li><em>The panel next found that as to the library subscription services market, the district court did not abuse its discretion by holding that the FTC had not made an adequate showing that the merger would substantially lessen competition. Because Activision Blizzard had long opposed putting its content on library subscription services, the merger’s effect of making such content available for the first time in the subscription market, even if exclusive to Microsoft, would not substantially lessen competition. </em></li>
<li><em>Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in similarly finding an insufficient likelihood of </em><em>success on the FTC’s claim that the merger would substantially lessen competition in the cloud-streaming market, given that the FTC failed to show that Activision Blizzard content would be available to this market in the absence of the merger.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>That ruling was the definitive step towards Microsoft's finalization of the $68.7 billion acquisition. The whole deal could have fallen apart if the judge ruled in favor of the US Federal Trade Commission. Microsoft would formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the acquisition's closing on October 13, 2023.</p>
<p>The FTC's fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty exclusive to the Xbox platform turned out to be completely unfounded. In fact, the Xbox and Windows company shifted its strategy toward the opposite side of the spectrum, opting to bring all of its games even to rival consoles such as those made by PlayStation and Nintendo. Just two days ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Gears of War: Reloaded will bring the original trilogy of the sci-fi third-person shooter to PlayStation 5 this Summer.</p>
<p>Between that and the fact that all of Microsoft-owned games are now available on cloud services such as NVIDIA GeForce NOW and Boosteroid, there's no doubt that a wider audience is able to play those games following the acquisition.</p>

			<p>PUBG Productions announced that it has launched a new closed beta for its upcoming single-player survival roguelike,<a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/"> Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. This is the fifth playtesting event that PUBG Productions has hosted since the game's reveal in December 2024, with the game due out in early access sometime in summer 2025.</p>
<p>The closed beta will run from today, May 7, to May 14, and is available on Steam and the Epic Games Store. To participate, you need to sign up through the studio's official <a href="https://discord.gg/P3PUCmUV">Discord</a> to receive a code for either storefront. Signing up gets you a code, you don't have to wait to see if you've been accepted into the closed beta. Though, PUBG Productions does stipulate that codes are being given out on a "<em>first-come first-servered basis</em>," so better to be quick if you want to try out Prologue: Go Wayback!.</p>

<p>Even if you do miss this playtest, though, in the PUBG Productions Discord, the team has already confirmed there will be another playtest next month, beginning June 2, 2025. So you'll have another chance, and maybe even another after that, if it ends up releasing in August 2025.</p>
<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/">spoke to PUBG creator Brendan Greene</a> about Prologue: Go Wayback!, Greene outlined his goals for the game as part of a three-game project.</p>
<p>"<em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. it's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a test bed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em>"</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't such a significant update to convince players to return to Starfield. Still, fans of the game are hoping Bethesda can continue improving the sci-fi roleplaying game beyond the Shattered Space expansion that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was released last year</a>. That's what the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> a couple of months ago through social media channels, hinting that 'exciting things' would be added to the game later in 2025. The announcement might come during the Xbox Games Showcase, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set for June 8</a>.</p>
