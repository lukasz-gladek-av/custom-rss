			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> offers ample character customization possibilities with one of the series' most versatile Job Systems to date. However, having this many abilities can feel overwhelming, especially with Reaction Abilities, whose efficacy can be challenging to evaluate just from their in-game descriptions. As these abilities are a central part of combat, often turning a losing fight into a decisive win, the right choice can completely change how a unit performs on the battlefield.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: This guide is based on Enhanced mode’s Tactician difficulty, but it applies to other difficulty settings and Classic mode as well. All screenshots were captured from the 1.0 Steam version.</em></strong></p>



<div><h2>The Best Reaction Abilities in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-shirahadori" data-level="2">Shirahadori</a></li><li><a href="#h-auto-potion" data-level="2">Auto-Potion</a></li><li><a href="#h-critical-recover-hp" data-level="2">Critical: Recover HP</a></li><li><a href="#h-mana-shield" data-level="2">Mana Shield</a></li><li><a href="#h-vanish" data-level="2">Vanish</a></li><li><a href="#h-reflexes" data-level="2">Reflexes</a></li><li><a href="#h-first-strike" data-level="2">First Strike</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-shirahadori">Shirahadori</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shirahadori is the best Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Samurai</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 700</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Shirahadori is undoubtedly the best Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles for any unit with high Bravery. This ability turns the unit's Bravery stat into its parry rate for all physical attacks, both melee and ranged, meaning that a unit with 90+ Bravery will be able to parry the vast majority of physical attacks. While it doesn't provide any defense against magic or monster attacks, Shirahadori is so good that it makes it possible for a single unit to clear out an entire map without getting damaged once.</p>



<h2 id="h-auto-potion">Auto-Potion</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Auto-Potion is just as useful as Shirahadori, depending on the situation</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Chemist</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 400</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Auto-Potion is the ultimate restorative Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, and the ability to learn for Ramza to win the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-win-the-battle-at-riovanes-castle-keep-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-guide/">most challenging battle in the game</a>. This ability makes it so a unit automatically uses a Potion when receiving damage, prioritizing the weaker Potions in your possession. As such, you can get a guaranteed 150 HP healed per attack for a unit with high Bravery if you discard every Potion and Hi-Potion to use X-Potions exclusively, granting this unit unparalleled survivability against every attack that doesn't take them down.</p>



<h2 id="h-critical-recover-hp">Critical: Recover HP</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Critica: Recover HP is a solid Reaction Ability for tanks like the Samurai or the Knight</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Monk</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 500 JP</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Critical: Recover HP is not on the same level as Auto-Potion in terms of utility, but it's a pretty good ability to equip, especially for tanks with high HP like the Knight, Samurai, and Dragoon. When a unit is damaged and put in Critical condition, the ability will fully restore its HP. Unlike Auto-Potion, Critical: Recover HP has a higher degree of risk, as an attack could put the unit to low HP but not in Critical condition, so it's a little less reliable, but it's still overall very solid.</p>



<h2 id="h-mana-shield">Mana Shield</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Mana Shield requires some upkeep to be effective, but it's very good nonetheless</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Time Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 400 </strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Mana Shield is another solid Reaction Ability in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles that can give a unit excellent survivability with the proper setup. With this ability equipped, received damage will be converted from HP to MP, which is great for any unit that doesn't use spells, essentially allowing them to survive mortal 1-hit KO attacks with no drawback. If you pair this ability with the Monk's Martial Arts skill Chakra, you can restore your MP to continue using this ability once the unit's MP has been depleted without having to rely on items.</p>



<h2 id="h-vanish">Vanish</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Vanish is a great Reaction Ability to take some risks against enemies using physical attacks</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Ninja</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 1000</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Vanish is a really good reaction ability that works best for units with excellent mobility to reduce the risks of rushing into enemy groups or for backline mages getting targeted by Archers. Upon receiving a physical attack, the unit will be granted Invisibility, making it impossible for them to be targeted by the enemy. Unfortunately, Invisibility will end as soon as the unit takes action, so Vanish isn't as versatile as some of the other best Reaction Abilities in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-reflexes">Reflexes</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Reflexes can make some units almost untouchable</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Ninja</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 400</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Reflexes is a good Reaction Ability that works great for units with an innate high evasion rate or those equipping cloaks. Upon receiving an attack, the unit's evasion rates against physical and magical attacks are increased significantly, making it easier for them to evade attacks. Equip this ability to a Ninja wearing a cloak, and enemies will have a tough time hitting them, although there's still the small chance that attacks will land, so reliability isn't the best.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-strike">First Strike</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>First Strike can be devastating with certain character builds.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Job: Monk</strong></li>



<li><strong>JP: 1300</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>First Strike requires more effort to learn than the other Reaction Abilities above, but with the proper setup, it can be used offensively and defensively. This ability prevents human units within standard attack range from dealing damage by preemptively attacking them. While its usage is limited to standard physical attacks, if you equip a unit with both First Strike and the Dual Wield support ability from the Ninja, you can create a unit that can obliterate physical attackers before they even get the chance to attack.</p>



<p>With these Reaction Abilities, you should have no trouble dealing with every enemy that bars your way in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview published in the latest EDGE Magazine (<a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/us/edge-subscription/dp/39f150bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issue 416</a>), Embark Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founder and CEO Patrick Söderlund</a> spoke about the coincidence of the studio's next game, ARC Raiders, and Battlefield 6 launching in the same month. </p>



<p>As some of you might recall, Söderlund was CEO and then Vice President and General Manager of DICE for over ten years. As such, Battlefield was a huge part of his career. The executive said Battlefield 6 looks really good, and expressed happiness that the franchise is in a good place now.</p>



<p><em>It is odd. I mean, we built Battlefield! But honestly, when I saw Battlefield 6 and what the team has done with it, I know how much time and energy has gone into it. I think it looks really good, and I’m very happy it does look good. It’s an IP and a game that deserves to be great. I want to play it. And I will play it – until the day we release ARC Raiders. And then I will play ARC Raiders instead.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Due on October 30</a>, ARC Raiders, a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter, is admittedly very different from Battlefield 6. However, Embark's debut title, THE FINALS, has a lot more in common with Battlefield, a first-person shooter with an emphasis on environmental destructibility. </p>



<p>The game launched in December 2023 and has had its ups and downs. Fans should not worry, anyway, as Söderlund said that Embark plans to support THE FINALS for years to come.</p>



<p><em>We take a 12-month approach, reviewing on an annual basis. In December 2024, it’d been out for a year, we sat down and said, ‘We’ll give it one more year and see what happens’. And then, relatively quickly, during the spring, we saw an uplift. So, right now, I don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t continue supporting it for the next five years, to be honest.</em></p>



<p>Season 8 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-season-8-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched last month</a>, adding new weapons and improving the game's physics destruction.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Handheld Rumored To Have Been Canceled Over AMD’s High Minimum Order Requirements]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-canceled-amd-minimum-order/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-rumored-to-have-been-canceled-over-amd%E2%80%99s-high-minimum-order-requirements.1317247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/">Xbox handheld </a>has been canceled over AMD's high minimum order requirements, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumors originated from the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-we-are-actively-investing-in-our-future-first-party-consoles-and-devices-designed-engineered-and-built-by-xbox.1688818/page-4#post-270871817">NeoGAF forums</a>, where known AMD leaker Kepler L2, who accurately provided information multiple times in the past regarding AMD products, including consoles, said that, as far as they know, the handheld was canceled because AMD wanted a commitment of over 10 million units to justify the R&amp;D required to make a dedicated SoC for the console. However, with the Steam Deck selling around 5 million units, and the ASUS ROG only selling no more than 2 million units, Microsoft didn't want to take the risk.</p>



<p>Despite Kepler L2's excellent track record, we have to take the real reason behind the cancellation of the Xbox handheld with a grain of salt. As the system was never officially announced, Microsoft will unlikely release an official statement on it. However, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-might-go-full-third-party-leaving-hardware-for-good-rumor/">the company's strategy seemingly shifting more towards becoming a third-party publisher</a>, it's quite possible it didn't want to commit to producing so many units for a system that may not have been a massive seller.</p>



<p>Although the Xbox handheld was never formally announced, there was no doubt that a portable system has been in the works at some point, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/">execs teasing it multiple times in the past</a>. The system would have been part of the company's handheld strategy, which is now going to be centered around the ROG Xbox Ally launching later this month. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">its relatively high price</a>, the handheld system is proving to be quite popular, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-already-selling-out-across-the-globe/"> it's already sold out almost everywhere</a> before its launch set for October 16.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-get-two-masters-dlc-early-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-to-get-%E2%80%98the-two-masters%E2%80%99-dlc-in-early-2026.1317172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KOEI TECMO's Team Ninja is about to launch NINJA GAIDEN 4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to be available on October 21</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), but their work doesn't stop there, given that there is a DLC titled 'The Two Masters' due to be released early next year.</p>



<p>Game Director Masakazu Hirayama talked about this DLC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIGrGeUYAeA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the latest episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, which was recorded at Tokyo Game Show 2025. </p>



<p><em>The Two Masters DLC, which will be available in early 2026, contains new weapons for Yakumo and Ryu. You can see from the key visual that Yakumo's new weapon captures his personality and his approach to combat with his expressive abilities. Whereas Ryu’s weapon has a more precise look to it and will allow you to perform powerful and high-speed abilities. Each of these weapons will have its own distinct qualities and a plethora of mechanics for NINJA GAIDEN 4 players to dig into. So, we invite players to look forward to it.<br>In addition to these weapons, there's also going to be new story content included in the Two Masters DLC, and the story content takes place after the events of the base game and unfolds from the perspective of both of these characters. In addition to the story content, there will also be post-game challenge content that exists separately from the Ninja Trials that are in the base game. So there is a lot of content for players to dig into.</em></p>



<p>The Two Masters DLC can be accessed by purchasing NINJA GAIDEN 4 Deluxe Edition or the Deluxe Edition Upgrade. The Deluxe Edition costs $20 more than the base edition.</p>



<p>The base game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-to-last-15-20-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last between 15 and 20 hours</a>, but the DLC will undoubtedly increase the time players can spend in the action game. Team Ninja did not quantify by how much, though.</p>
