			<p>Amidst the craze of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards 2025 nominees</a> being announced, Microsoft and Xbox revealed that it is hosting an Xbox Partner Preview later this week on November 20, 2025. The show will feature games from Xbox's third-party partners, including IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">showing off more of 007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/">Tarsier Studios showing off more of Reanimal.</a></p>



<p>The preview event will take place at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT on Thursday, November 20, and you'll be able to watch it live on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok, though Xbox doesn't say how long it will be.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re excited to reveal that the next Xbox Partner Preview – our broadcast that shines a light on upcoming games from our talented third-party partners – is coming this Thursday, November 20,</em>" <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/17/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-announce/?ocid=Evergreen_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_11.17.1">a post on Xbox Wire reads</a>. "<em>This show will include news on upcoming games from partners including IO Interactive, Tencent and THQ Nordic, plus some brand-new reveals and Game Pass announcements</em>."</p>



<p>We know that both 007 First Light and Reanimal are aiming to release sometime in 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-reanimal-release-date-q1-2026/">the latter of which is still missing a specific release date</a>. So it's probably safe to say we won't be hearing about games that are going to hit shelves before the end of this year, with this preview event focused more on games arriving in 2026, more specifically, the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>Tides of Annihilation getting a mention in the Xbox Wire post is interesting, since we've not seen much of that game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/">since earlier this year when Wccftech spoke to the development team</a>. Perhaps we'll finally learn of the game's release date in this showcase. Overall, hopefully the show has one or two interesting announcements for those tuning in.</p>
