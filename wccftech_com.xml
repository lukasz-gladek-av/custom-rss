			<p>The release date and trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">Star Wars Outlaw's</a> next DLC expansion, A Pirate's Fortune, have leaked online ahead of its scheduled reveal during Star Wars Celebration tomorrow, with the currently unlisted trailer appearing on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-reveal-trailer-launches-on-may-15th.1167036/">ResetEra</a>. Since publishing, Ubisoft has taken the trailer down.</p>
<p>Both the trailer and the video's description spoil the surprise that players will be able to step back into the boots of Kay Vess and experience an adventure with fan-favorite character Hondo Ohnaka on <strong>May 15, 2025</strong>, with the DLC including its own season pass, just as the first DLC, Wild Card, did.</p>
<p>The new expansion will also feature cosmetic items inspired by the recent television series Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, including an outfit for Nix, a trophy for the speeder, and trinkets for your speeder and Kay's ship, the Trailblazer.</p>
<p>This new trailer doesn't reveal too much about the story for A Pirate's Fortune, only that you'll be pitted against Stinger Tash and her band of Rokana Raiders while you race against them to do a bit of tomb raiding in the Khepi Tomb.</p>
<p>A Pirate's Fortune is the second of two planned DLCs for Star Wars Outlaws, after which Ubisoft is likely to announce that it has moved on to future projects, especially when considering that, by Ubisoft's admission, Outlaws did not have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">commercial performance</a> Ubisoft was expecting from it.</p>

			<p>Codemasters announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-announced-for-may-30-launch-pc-requirements-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a> will join the extremely elite club of games supporting path tracing. Just like with all the others (Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Portal with RTX), the feature is a PC exclusive.</p>
<p>On the subject, the developer said:</p>
<p><em>Expanding on Ray Tracing technology and available as a new “Ultra Max” option in the graphics settings, light now follows every bounced path, including that from indirect lighting and multiple reflections. Shade, light, and colours dynamically shift as they would in real-life, whether you’re racing under the thousands of lights in Bahrain or navigating the castle section on Baku at sunset.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have a PC capable of experiencing it, Path Tracing is the most realistic simulation of light on track that we’ve ever delivered.</em></p>
<p>These aren't the only visual and technical improvements that fans will find in F1 25. Tonemapping and light balance improvements promise a more dramatic effect in all types of weather, with better representation of changes in cloud cover. There are also some enhancements to the track surface shader, which now displays more pronounced tyre and lock-up marks as well as physical changes based on other collected real-world data.</p>
<p>The addition of light detection and ranging scanning (LIDAR) makes tracks far more accurate overall. LIDAR also helped trees and foliage better match the species, placement, size, and shape of their real-life counterparts, with new additions such as cherry blossom trees in Suzuka.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Authenticity and Customization Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2E_sML5CfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Codemasters also introduced NVIDIA Audio2Face. This technology (already seen in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl) improved the facial animations that players will see during modes such as Career and Braking Point. The reintroduced press interviews now capture drivers delivering their responses in a more authentic fashion, with this technology extending to facility heads in My Team. Lastly, PS5 Pro console users will enjoy split-screen racing at 60 frames per second in this year's edition of the official F1 racing game.</p>
<p>Codemasters hasn't shared the system requirements for path tracing usage on PC, but we'll let you know once it does. F1 25 will be available on May 30 across PC and consoles.</p>

			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> CI Games <a href="https://x.com/CIGamesOfficial/status/1912876320360439961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that there will be a small delay to the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0 on Steam due to a technical issue. The Epic Games Store, Windows Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X versions are unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> Today, CI Games launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen 2.0</a>, a 'definitive' update to the Soulslike game that seeks to address several of the community's requests. Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates. The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.</em></p>
<p>As the executive mentioned, the game now includes fully shared co-op progression and a Free Friend's Pass. There's now free access to the character creator and the entire tutorial area of the base game. Following the completion of the tutorial, players can experience the entire adventure in online co-operative multiplayer when playing with a friend who owns the base game. Character progress and loot are saved between sessions, though only the host retains world progression.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen 2.0, both co-op players save all mainline story progress when on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough, having killed a similar number of main bosses (within one). Defeated bosses and lit beacons persist in both worlds; both players can revive each other and collect 100% vigor and all loot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen 2.0 Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WOqW5SRwYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are also other improvements to be found in Lords of the Fallen 2.0. The character creator now includes improved facial options, skin textures, and body shapes for both male and female models. The User Interface has been overhauled to be cleaner and easier to navigate, and a new guidebook has been added so players may reference previous tutorial prompts at any time.</p>
<p>The combat system now has more accurate weapon handling and refined lock-on mechanics. Mobility has been improved, featuring quicker evasion moves and more responsive controls. A dedicated jump button improves the platforming experience. Weapon audio was enhanced, amplifying every swing, parry, and block. A brand-new Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic now highlights the path forward through Mournstead. Lastly, new grievous strike button prompts have been added.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a free update for existing users. Any potential newcomers can now get the game at discounted pricing:</p>
<p>● PlayStation Spring Sale (April 9th – April 23rd):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 72% off at $19.60<br>
○ Deluxe Upgrade Pack (from Standard to Deluxe): 72% off at $5.60<br>
● Xbox Spring Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 70% off at $20.99, also included in Game Pass<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 70% off at $23.99<br>
● Steam Custom Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>

● Epic Games Store Savings (April 10th – April 24th):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10</p>
<p>The game didn't score highly <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, but perhaps he'll be willing to give it another chance with the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0.</p>
