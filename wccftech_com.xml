			<p>A new Star Wars Outlaws update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 on PC and a PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvement, among other small fixes.</p>
<p>Title Update 1.5.1, which is around 3 GB big on PC and Xbox consoles and 1.93 GB big on PlayStation 5, introduces NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on PC, allowing owners of any NVIDIA RTX graphics card to enjoy better image quality with the new Transformer model and RTX 50 series graphics card owners to boost FPS by using AI to generate up to three frames per traditionally rendered frame.</p>
<p>The new Star Wars Outlaws title update also brings, as mentioned above, a PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvement, updating the PSSR upscaler to the latest version, which addresses some image quality issues that were very clearly noticeable in the previous version of the game. Additionally, the update fixes a few other small issues on every platform, as detailed in the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1O5273Z4vy6zpjNxkW4htN">official patch notes.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws launched last year in a far from optimal state, but developer Ubisoft Massive has consistently improved the game, fixing the biggest issues and tweaking the gameplay as needed. In a previous update, the developer also removed some divisive <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stealth missions to </a>enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
