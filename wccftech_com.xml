			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally is launching in a few months, but Microsoft reportedly has yet to commit to a price due to the uncertainty of the current economic situation.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/so-just-how-much-will-the-xbox-ally-cost-heres-what-we-know-so-far">Windows Central</a> corroborated the rumored October launch window for the two handhelds, clarifying they are tentatively slated for late October. According to the outlet's sources, however, the rumored prices of $499 for the base model and $799 for the premium model may not be accurate, as Microsoft has yet to commit to a price due to the tariffs imposed by the United States on products manufactured in countries such as China and Taiwan, where ASUS manufactures its products.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X were revealed earlier this month during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, following a few teases shared in the past few months. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which will deliver higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither model, however, will feature a superior<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/"> OLED display</a>, as ASUS had to balance adding the nowadays essential VRR support with power draw and costs, deeming an LCD panel an ultimately better choice.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally handhelds will launch before the end of the year worldwide.</p>

			<p>Xbox has just confirmed the next batch of Xbox Game Pass games being added into the service, with 11 more games joining across the rest of the month of June and into the very beginning of July.</p>
<p>That's 20 games added to the service this month alone, after Xbox announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-the-alters-ea-sports-fc-25-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-june/">at the start of June what players</a> would be getting for their Game Pass subscriptions. The news came through an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/17/xbox-game-pass-june-2025-wave-2/">Xbox Wire post</a>, which begins with the games we already knew were being added to the service that are live today, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/">FBC: Firebreak</a>, before going into what'll come throughout the rest of June.</p>
<p>Beginning this week and spanning through to July 1, Xbox Game Pass subscribers will be able to dive into Sloclap's new soccer game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">Rematch</a>, which is launching into the subscription service. Then, towards the end of next week, the first three Warcraft games will all make their way onto the service.

<p>There are even a few bits of DLC being added to the service, with Fallout 76's upcoming Gone Fission DLC, Minecraft's Chase the Skies DLC, and Dead by Daylight's Five Nights at Freddy's DLC, all added to the service today.</p>
<p>As is always the case, with new games being added to the service, others are being taken away. Here are the six games that will be leaving Game Pass on June 30:</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-voice-actors-teasing-red-dead-announcement-coming-this-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-voice-actors-seem-to-be-teasing-a-red-dead-related-announcement-coming-this-week.1220568/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-voice-actors-teasing-red-dead-announcement-coming-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rob Wiethoff, the actor who plays John Marston in Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2, teased in a <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1934015849603453002">live stream this past Saturday</a> while playing Red Dead Redemption, that there's 'something' coming this week related to the Red Dead series, likely closer to Friday, that he is incredibly excited to share and discuss with players, once the news is made public.</p>
<p>"<em>I've got such exciting news. I can't share it with you right now, and it's absolutely killing</em> <em>me</em>," he began. "<em>By the end of this week, hopefully sooner. Not this week, I guess. Probably, not as soon as tomorrow, but definitely before Friday. Oh my goodness, the news that I have to share - and I won't be the only one sharing it. I cannot wait for you to know what's going on. And that's all I can say.</em>"</p>
<p>What made it seem like a direct reference to Red Dead and a Red Dead-related announcement coming is that he ended his vague and excited statement by saying "<em>I'm so excited, but I truly cannot think of anything else, especially playing this game, I can't think of anything else.</em>"</p>
<p>Adding to Wiethoff's vague statements after the live stream was Roger Clark, the actor who plays Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2. When asked if he knew what Wiethoff was talking about on X, <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934308877446660381">he replied with a simple "<em>Yes,</em>"</a> and a gif of a grinning dog, smiling like they have a secret no one else knows.</p>
<p>Then, Noshir Dalal, the voice actor for Charles in Red Dead Redemption 2, <a href="https://x.com/NoshirDalal/status/1934390960332378568">replied to Clark's tweet with his own vague tease,</a> adding even more weight to the pile.</p>
<p>It's possible that all three actors are hinting that we'll finally get the reveal of the long-awaited current-gen update for Red Dead Redemption 2, a game that originally launched on PS4 and Xbox One, and is still without a native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version. Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-enhanced-ambient-occlusion-trailer-quality/">even better with certain mods,</a> but console players are still left playing the last-gen version. A PS5 and Series X/S version would be a huge announcement for fans of the series.</p>
<p>And now that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-better-lighting-shadows-comparison/">first Red Dead game has a remastered</a> and graphically upgraded version, it's high time the sequel gets its due.</p>
<p>It could also be that Rockstar is about to add another game to the Nintendo Switch 2 lineup, with a Switch 2 version of RDR2 coming. It could also be that the game is coming to Switch 2, and it's getting a native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version with graphical upgrades.</p>
<p>Or it's none of them, and instead we're getting some sort of Red Dead adaptation or just something else entirely. Who knows at this point, but you have to imagine that Wiethoff and company wouldn't get players riled up if there wasn't something big behind it. Just weeks ago, we saw voice actors from the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/">Persona 4 cast make subtle hints</a> in the lead-up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-revival-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-new-trailer/">Persona 4 Revival's</a> reveal. Hopefully, these teases are leading towards a similar level of announcement.</p>
