			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levine-judas-ghost-story-games-art-no-release-date-update/">Three months after its first developer blog</a>, Ghost Story Games and Ken Levine are back to remind everyone that Judas is still around, that the studio is still working on it, and that it is still planning to be released, eventually. On that last point, no, the blog does not include a release date or an indication as to when it'll be out. In fairness, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">a trailer at The Game Awards</a> could give players all the answers they want that are not included in this blog, but we could also just as easily go another year wondering how the spiritual successor to BioShock is coming along.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-2">As far as what the blog does include,</a> we get a new piece of concept art of the game's titular character, Judas. We also hear from several members of the development team, instead of just hearing from Ken Levine, with lead narrative designer Drew Mitchell, lead artist Karen Segars, and studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff all contributing comments on the creative process behind Judas, and more specifically, the development of its main character.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>The project began with us wanting to tell stories that are less linear, that react to the player and unfold in ways that no one’s ever seen in one of Ken’s games</em>," said Mitchell. "<em>That told us a lot up front about what we’d need: namely, characters with strong, competing objectives, who each had a stake in everything the player did. Starting with that framework, we spent a lot of time thinking about those characters, their conflicts, the right setting to force them all together, and the systems underpinning it all. For a long time, there wasn’t even a set protagonist — just sort of a cipher, a blank slate.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Eventually, the story and world started to coalesce into something specific, and we needed to figure out who the player character should be. As a rule, you want to put your heroes in the last place they ever want to find themselves. So, what kind of person would really struggle to deal with all these relationships and warring interests? And I remember that was the point where Ken came up with this monologue that kicked everything off.</em>"</p>



<p>Studio art director Nathan Phail-Liff also added comments on how the game's setting evolved in its creation, and how it grew from a more practical location to what it is now. "<em></em><em>At the beginning of its journey, it was a more practical, conventional, modular starship. But over the course of its mission, due to conflict between factions of people and ideals, it's changed into what you see now. And we're working on communicating this through the environment.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Like with any city with significant history, if you start digging up the street, you would find layers of the city's past.  Older eras of street long buried, forgotten, and built over by the roads upon which you now walk.  With the Mayflower as a generational starship, we want to imbue this world with the same sense of time, history, and credibility; this is a civilization that went through eras of conflict and rebirth. And having the characters and the architecture of the world reflect those layers of the onion is a powerful mechanism for visual storytelling. This allows players to act as a sort of historian and architect as they explore the Mayflower. Through uncovering more, you’ll make increasingly informed decisions with the story and characters on your journey.</em>"</p>



<p>All of this is, ultimately, wonderful insight to how Judas has been created in the years since development began, and it's good to see Ghost Story Games communicating to players with a little more frequency than we've seen previously.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this continues, and we'll get an even better look into the game and perhaps even some gameplay soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Santa Ragione's horror game, Horses, <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/">getting banned on Steam with only vague reasons to back up its ban</a> was an additional tally on the year for Valve getting mixed up in controversy <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">regarding what it allows and what it doesn't allow on Steam</a>. Epic Games Store, seemingly, felt out of the loop, so it decided to join the fray by also disallowing Horses to release on its digital storefront, even though it was previously slated to arrive alongside launches at <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?hmb_source=search_bar">Humble</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> today, December 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The difference, however, is typical of the difference between Epic Games Store and Steam. Whatever Steam does, the Epic Games Store does worse. When Steam banned Horses, it did so based on an early, unfinished version of the game, and kept its exact reasoning and policies around why it was banned vague enough, preventing Santa Ragione from refuting direct issues Valve seemingly had with the game.</p>



<p>Epic Games, however, banned Horses approximately 24 hours before it was set to launch on the EGS. Per <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17">Santa Ragione's website for Horses</a>, Epic told the Italian indie developer that it is "<em>Unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies.</em>"</p>







<p>The email continued, "<em></em><em>The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which 'contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.' The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.</em> <em>This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology).</em>"</p>



<p>But prior to this email, Horses was set to be available on the EGS and had been approved for release on the store. So what changed? That's the million-dollar question, it would seem, especially because elements that Epic is claiming are in the game simply aren't there, according to Santa Ragione.</p>



<p>"<em>The game does NOT contain explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior," </em>the studio claims in a statement<em>. "All nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation. There is never any visible sexual act involving genitalia and all animations are stylized and unrealistic. Additionally, in the three hours of gameplay contained in the game, there are only four brief and censored sexual sequences, with two of them happening mainly off camera</em>...<em>the content presented does not in any way promote abuse (including animal abuse). The game is a strong critique of violence and abuse in general.</em>"</p>



<p>Santa Ragione also pointed out that when it filled out the IARC Questionnaire as part of the process to get approved for release on the EGS in the first place, it received a PEGI 18 and M for Mature rating, not an AO rating.</p>



<p>Even with these reminders, and Santa Ragione begging its contact at Epic Games Store to consider the fact that builds of this game had been approved multiple times, with a final achievement build getting approved well over two weeks ahead of launch. Santa Ragione received no reply from its contact, instead getting an automated message that its appeal had been denied. Epic also failed to point to a specific instance of content within Horses it took issue with, so even if Santa Ragione wanted to make changes to release on EGS, it doesn't know where Epic believes the problem lies.</p>



<p>The whole way this story has evolved is extremely unfortunate, because here is an indie developer whose work revolves around trying to elevate the kinds of stories we can tell in video games, the subject matter tackled, and how more serious issues are tackled, that will likely now be shuttered because it won't be able to recoup development costs for its latest, and now potentially last, release. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, earlier this year, Steam allowed a game <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">that directly promoted sexual abuse to appear on its store, and had to be told to remove it</a>, only doing so in select regions. It was the developers themselves who eventually took it down entirely.</p>



<p>One of these games is a commentary and critique on abuse, the other contained explicit abuse and sexual violence for entertainment. It's frankly disturbing that the latter was able to make it onto Steam, while the former isn't given a place on the store at all.</p>
