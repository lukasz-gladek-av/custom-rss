			<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/nintendo-says-demand-for-switch-2-console-in-japan-overwhelming?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report, analysts are expecting Nintendo to have &nbsp;6-8 million <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> units on hand for its June 5 launch. This would make it one of the biggest console launches in the video game industry's history.</p>
<p>Coming into 2025, everyone expected the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 to be one of the most significant events of the year. Demand for the Switch 2 has even exceeded Nintendo's expectations. In Japan alone, Nintendo received 2.2 million applications from consumers looking to grab a Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had to take to <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">X</a> to formally apologize to players that "<em>a significant number of applicants won't be selected</em>" because the demand exceeded expectations. Bloomberg's report also notes that Nintendo is doing what it can to increase console production to meet the demand as best it can by June 5.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 only went live in the United States and Canada today, after having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">delayed</a> due to tariffs announced by the U.S. Consumers looking to lock in their pre-orders<a href="https://x.com/spencerhakimian/status/1915257488703705328?s=46"> reported</a> that websites for retailers like Best Buy and Walmart crashed due to the overwhelming flood of traffic. The outages weren't too bad overall, as many people were still gleefully announcing they had grabbed a pre-order.</p>
<p>While the price of the Switch 2 and its games remains controversial for players, those who could grab a pre-order or buy it on day one are likely getting a better deal than those who choose to wait. Tariffs still loom over the console's pricing like a dark cloud, and we've already seen them impact the Switch 2, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">increased the price</a> of several Switch 2 accessories as a response to tariffs.</p>
<p>The price of the console has stayed the same for now, but Nintendo stipulated that it could still increase in the future, "<em>depending on market conditions</em>."</p>
