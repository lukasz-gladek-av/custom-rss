			<p>Newzoo has released<a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/global-games-market-update-q1-2025?utm_campaign=5745787-2025-Newzoo-Press&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-__Dq-HWVzJK08jsx_6t5jYPEY6DxXW-ixoHYynq9c2ftlODIAJQBurdpm-hpCBe74HoSVI9UKPBo2ONoLUJYJ5h29KoQ&amp;_hsmi=350466789&amp;utm_content=350466789&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its latest report</a> and has also announced that it has implemented new changes that will make the reports more accurate than ever. The company is dedicated to refining its data products so that all information provided about the gaming industry is trustworthy and helps provide a true insight into the industry. This has been achieved by improved data integration with Newzoo's Game Performance Monitor, as well as new acquisitions where they acquired the Steam Data Suite, which is now known as Newzoo's Business Store Intelligence.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As a result of these new changes, Newzoo has created a new report that dives into the industry's global forecast and what comes next in terms of revenue and growth compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Comparing the industry to the last three years, it's set to recover as a whole, to a more mature "new normal." All three platforms (Console, Mobile, PC) are expected to return to growth. However, it won't be a massive amount of growth and will stay in the low single digits. Thus far, it's forecasted to be 3.7%.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The PC market is forecast to grow similarly to the mobile market in the sense that microtransactions, such as in-game cosmetics, loot boxes, and battle passes, will drive the revenue on that platform. Among the PC market, Fortnite and Roblox will continue to remain popular and get consistent engagement, with new content streams being released regularly. Growth in China specifically is expected to slow down, while Japan's popularity will continue to rise over this period.</p>
<p>While some may feel that consoles are dying out, Newzoo predicts that it will instead actually get a major boost, thanks to some upcoming major releases. This includes the highly-anticipated release of Grand Theft Auto VI that is set to release this year, which is triggering increased hardware upgrades. While the publishers aren't mentioned, those that are developing titles for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S expect that they will profit from the peak install base.</p>
<p>Thus far, console users are set to have a good amount of games releasing that will bring in a lot of revenue, including Grand Theft Auto VI. Most recently is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which has already proven to be incredibly popular. The Nintendo Switch 2 is also set to release this year, which means there will be some highly-anticipated games from audiences of all ages, including Pokemon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>The mobile market has reached market maturity, where player growth has lowered significantly to below 3% annually outside of the typical growth regions. Eastern Asia has particularly low player growth compared to other regions.</p>

			<p>The latest NACON Connect is over, delivering some big news for fans of RoboCop, Styx, Cthulhu, and more.</p>
<p>Let's start with the man of steel. Following the success of RoboCop: Rogue City, which was the publisher's biggest launch and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2023-solid-transitory-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned the vote of our community</a> for Best Shooter Game of 2023, Teyon is back with a standalone expansion titled RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business. Due to launch this Summer, it will task players to reach the top of Omni Tower, now overrun by elite mercenaries. RoboCop will have access to new weapons, brutal finishing moves, and special missions that will take players through intense flashbacks and offer the chance to play as Alex Murphy (prior to the accident) for the first time in a video game.</p>

<p>The showcase featured another return. The sneaky goblin <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styx</a> will come back in Styx: Blades of Greed, once again developed by Cyanide Studio. The few details shared by NACON point to the game keeping its formula:&nbsp;open-ended environments, a vast range of powers and tools, and<br>
multiple approaches to completing objectives. The mission is simple: stealing Quartz, a rare and magical resource. The game will be out in the Fall of 2025.</p>

<p>Cthulhu aficionados also have plenty of reasons to rejoice today with two new game announcements. Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss is in development at Big Bad Wolf (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-council-episode-5-demons-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Council</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-vampires-make-for-excellent-investigators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong</a>). It will be a first-person thriller/investigative adventure where players are put in the shoes of Noah, an agent of Ancile, a secret division of Interpol devoted to occult cases. Ancile investigates the mysterious disappearance of miners in the depths of the Pacific Ocean, eventually leading him to the labyrinthine prison of R'lyeh, an ancient sunken city where Cthulhu itself is imprisoned. This game will launch next year.</p>

<p>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu, on the other hand, is a first-person cooperative horror game in development at ACE Team (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clash-artifacts-of-chaos-from-zenos-ace-team-gets-november-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clash</a>, Zeno Clash) where players take the roles of Conquistadores on an expedition to discover a legendary underground city rumored to hold untold treasures. Being a Cthulhu game, they'll have to question their sanity at all times and stick together to try and make it out alive when the game launches later this year.</p>

<p>NACON Connect also featured extensive new footage of Rogue Factor's action/adventure game Hell Is Us. The video showed investigation mechanics in which players must rely on their powers of observation, deduction, and intuition to progress through the game and uncover the secrets of these mysterious lands. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-to-release-september-4-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is slated to debut on September 4</a>.</p>
