			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a major update</a> to their Project Amethyst collaboration (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally unveiled in December 2024</a>) this past week in a video featuring PlayStation Lead Architect Mark Cerny and AMD SVP and GM of the Computing and Graphics Group Jack Huynh. The duo presented three major new features, Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression, which will be coming to future AMD GPUs and consoles like Sony's PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>The video was only about nine minutes long, though, and inevitably left viewers with plenty of questions. Thankfully, the folks from Digital Foundry got a few answers from Mark Cerny via an email Q&amp;A and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7dK_X5tnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted them in their latest video</a>, where they also discussed the aforementioned features.</p>



<p>Firstly, when asked about the change in Sony's hardware and software strategy from the PlayStation 5 Pro to the next PlayStation console, Mark Cerny said Project Amethyst would bring about a monumental shift:</p>



<p><em>We've shifted our focus substantially. In the past, we were largely creating custom technologies just for PlayStation platforms. But now with Project Amethyst, we're placing substantially more of a focus on co-engineering and co-development with AMD on their roadmap hardware and libraries. That change will have a very large impact, because when developers can create their technology with the understanding that it will work across multiple platforms such as desktops, laptops, consoles, etc., there will be much larger pickup of new features. So I believe we'll see outsized impact from the technologies announced this past week!</em></p>



<p>Having said that, the PlayStation Lead Architect also admitted that any sort of quantification of the benefits brought by technologies like Universal Compression and Radiance Cores will have to wait until game developers actually implement them in their engines (when it comes to the former) or have access to the new hardware (when it comes to the latter).</p>



<p><em>With these technologies, we know that great stuff is coming but it’s difficult (or impossible) to quantify. For Universal Compression, I have high hopes for synergies with ML, for example, FSR and PSSR are recurrent neural networks that write feature maps to system memory - how well will those feature maps compress? Radiance Cores are similar, they are obviously a great way to do the processing, but I suspect we'Il need to get prototypes into the hands of game developers to understand the degree to which they will be able to “level up their engines.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, in the video announcement, Mark Cerny had stressed that all these features 'only exist in simulation right now', meaning it will take time before developers get to play with them.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The PlayStation Lead Architect also shared a couple more interesting tidbits in the email exchange with Digital Foundry. First, he agreed that Universal Compression is particularly important because it's becoming increasingly complex to achieve significant memory bandwidth increases from generation to generation. Secondly, he confirmed that Sony (and, by extension, AMD) is particularly interested in boosting machine learning and ray tracing for their next hardware compared to regular rasterization, which will get some improvements 'where possible' but is clearly not the focus anymore.</p>



<p>This ties nicely with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/">PlayStation 6 specs rumor</a> that mentioned 'only' a 2.5x to 3x rasterization improvement from the PlayStation 5, whereas ray tracing would be 6x to 12x faster in the new console (which, according to leaker Kepler, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony plans to launch in 2027</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Originally released in 1996, KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE still stands as one of SNK's less popular games . Despite never reaching the mainstream success of other franchises like The King of Fighters, Fatal Fury or Samurai Shodown, its cast of characters, tag mechanics, and distinctive visual design attracted a small, yet passionate cult following. Almost 30 years later, the game has arrived on PC with some brand new features as the second release of the NEOGEO Premium Selection</p>



<p>Before spending some time playing the new KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE release, which made me appreciate the game's unique take on the tag mechanics based on character positioning, I had the chance to talk with producer Laurent&nbsp;Vernézy about the new<strong> </strong>4-player mode, how the developers approached modern balance changes while keeping the spirit of the original intact, and what the future might hold for SNK’s classic arcade catalog.</p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE: This interview was conducted via written Q&amp;A.</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is considered a cult game, its popularity far from that of other SNK franchises like King of Fighters, Fatal Fury and Samurai Shodown. What inspired SNK to bring the game back now as part of the NEOGEO Premium Selection?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> With its charismatic characters, its tag battle mechanics, fast-paced gameplay, and unforgettable soundtrack, we felt KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE would be a great fit to join our brand-new NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION line-up after REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS, which launched a few weeks ago.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you expect the game to be received by a modern audience who never played it before?</p>



<p>A: We are very confident that KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE will be well received by younger audiences as well, due to its iconic characters, soundtrack, and great gameplay.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Were there any lessons learned from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3359900/REAL_BOUT_FATAL_FURY_2_THE_NEWCOMERS/">REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS</a> that influenced the development of this re-release?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS just came out a few weeks ago, so it’s still too early to note anything specific.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the gameplay a faithful recreation of the original arcade release, or was balance changed in some way?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. This premium port of KE STB is 100% faithful to the original title released on NEOGEO in 1996, so the gameplay and character balance is unchanged.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Rollback netcode has become the standard for online play in fighting games. Was it challenging to implement in a classic game?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Implementing rollback netcode in KE STB was not challenging, as it wasn’t the first time we added rollback netplay to our classic fighters. However, adding rollback netcode to a 4-player online game was quite challenging, but everything is ready now for intense online battles!</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is remembered by enthusiasts for its tag-based gameplay, and the new release further leans into it by expanding the 2 v 2 mode with 4-player and 3-player play modes which introduce an interesting twist to traditional online play. How did this idea come about? Was its development challenging?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> We wanted with our developer to ensure that all possibilities of versus tag battles was available in this premium port of KE STB, and we hope players will be happy with them!</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE comes with a hitbox viewer, which is an essential tool to master any fighting game as much as frame data is. Is it accessible in the game? If not, would you consider adding it post-launch if requested by the community?</p>

</figure>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, this premium version of KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE offers a hitbox viewer feature which is easily accessed through the Practice Mode, and can be toggled on or off.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE makes boss characters playable without any cheat code. Was anything done to make their inclusion in the base roster balanced for competitive play? Boss characters are notoriously overpowered in traditional fighting games.</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> No, nothing was done to change or alter Jyazu and King Leo. They are infamous for being very strong, but as they can’t tag other characters in our out, they’ll have to be careful when choosing one of the boss characters</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Has fighting game community feedback from the launch of REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS influenced the design of the new modes or features?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> No, as REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2 came out only a few weeks ago, it’s still too early to have enough feedback from its launch.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you see KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE potentially finding a place in the modern fighting game competitive scene, even as just a side game at the biggest competitions like EVO?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. There are countless fighting game genres and communities, and we are confident that a lot of young and veteran players will enjoy the return of KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS has yet to launch on consoles, and KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is only launching on PC. Are there plans to bring the NEOGEO Premium Selection to consoles? If so, would cross-platform play be considered?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> We haven’t decided yet if we will expand our NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION line to consoles, but if there is demand for, we will definitely consider it. Nothing has been decided yet regarding adding crossplay or not.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the future plans for the NEOGEO Premium Selection? Will releases be limited to fighting games?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, of course. There will be more rereleases of SNK classics as part of our NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION lineup, and it won’t be limited to classic fighting games.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>



<p>The relaunch of KIZUNA: SUPER TAG BATTLE clearly establishes the NEOGEO Premium Selection as a brand focused on enhanced classic experiences with new features and expanding beyond fighting games. While console plans remain undecided, the quality of this port and its new features only confirm that SNK is taking its arcade legacy seriously.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a long wait, Battlefield 6 is finally here, and it's also an excellent return to form for the series after a disappointing release in Battlefield 2042. If you're one of the hundreds of thousands of players on Steam (and potentially millions with consoles mixed in) jumping into it on launch, then this guide will help you step onto the battlefield with confidence.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-guide-best-early-weapons-and-loadouts-for-each-class/">our guide on the best early loadouts</a> delved into what weapons you'll want to jump in with and focus on unlocking as soon as possible, this guide will go over more general tips and ways of thinking when you're playing to help you have the right mindset for each match.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-guide-tips-to-rule-the-battlefield">Battlefield 6 Guide - Tips to Rule the Battlefield</h2>



<h3 id="h-play-your-role-and-play-together">Play your role, and play together</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield has always been a squad-focused game. Its class system is there for a reason, and especially when jumping into its signature modes like Conquest, which take full advantage of the multiple ground and air vehicles available, playing your role is key to success.</p>



<p>If you're running Support, keep your defibrillator handy and use it as often as you can. If you're playing Engineer, keep a launcher in your loadout to help take out tanks and jets if you can lock onto one. If you're playing Recon, be sure to spot enemy vehicles and mark them for your teammates, and try to keep an eye on the edges for enemies looking to flank your side. If you're playing Assault, use your added firepower and stay on the frontlines.</p>



<p>Every role is important, and playing your role instead of just running at enemies looking for kills is the difference between winning and losing a match, no matter what mode you're playing, but especially when playing any of the large-scale game modes.</p>



<h3 id="h-keep-an-eye-on-your-mag">Keep an eye on your mag</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is a simple tip, but that doesn't make it any less important. Battlefield is not Call of Duty, where you'll die long before you run out of bullets. It's very possible that being a little too trigger-happy can leave you without ammo for your primary weapon, and unless you're playing Support and can give yourself an ammo refresh, you'll be a free kill for the other side. </p>



<p>Yes, respawning is the fastest way to get back to a full magazine, but when dying means your side is down in reinforcements, you're actively hurting your side's chances of winning. You want to try to survive as long as possible, and part of that is keeping an eye on your ammo and not reloading the moment you let a few bullets fly. Time your reloads well, wait until you're towards the bottom of your magazine, and you know that if you were to get into another firefight, you'd lose it because you can't take out an enemy with sub-8 bullets.</p>



<p>It should also be said that keeping yourself mobile while in a firefight can be the difference between dying and getting a kill. If you can, dive to cover and use that time to reload if you absolutely have to. Use a grenade to give yourself even more time. Don't just spray and pray, and keep an eye on your ammo.</p>



<h3 id="h-go-ahead-jump-in-the-tank">Go ahead, jump in the tank</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Vehicles are a key part of Battlefield gameplay, and Battlefield 6 is no different. If a vehicle is available, don't be afraid to jump in. Having a tank on the battlefield for your squad or a jet fighter can be a huge difference maker, and you should be hesitant to jump in when you get the chance.</p>



<p>You can do solid damage to enemy frontlines, help take some of your squadmates across the map, and hold down the defensive line for your side.</p>



<h3 id="h-mount-your-launcher-to-your-rifle">Mount your launcher to your rifle</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can add a grenade launcher to your loadout as one of your gadgets, and the default way of doing so is swapping to it as a separate weapon. That's perfectly fine, of course, but to swap to your launcher even faster, mount it to your rifle. You can attach it as an underbarrel attachment, and it'll be a quick flick to swap from your launcher to your rifle.</p>



<h3 id="h-pay-attention-to-your-loadouts-and-weapon-customizations">Pay attention to your loadouts and weapon customizations</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is another tip that should feel obvious, but it's still worth saying - pay attention to your loadouts and your weapon customizations. Even seemingly small adjustments can make a difference in how a weapon performs for you, whether that's adjusting the ammo type to deal more penetration damage or a different magazine for a faster reload, or better ergonomics. </p>



<p>Your choice of attachments is just as important as your choice of weapons, and it's worth spending the time in the menu, going back and forth from menu to the firing range, to try things out and see how they feel for you.</p>



<h3 id="h-ping-your-enemies">Ping your enemies!</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you're not playing Recon and don't have a laser designator, you can still call out enemies for your squadmates. Use the ping system to help you and your squadmates keep track of enemies on the battlefield.</p>



<p>With the size of the maps in Battlefield 6, using the Ping system effectively can be a huge help, especially if you're not one for jumping into proximity chat or typing in the game chat. More so than in other multiplayer shooters, communication is key!</p>



<hr>



<p>These are just a few key tips to remember and to help you dominate on the battlefield now that Battlefield 6 is finally here.</p>
