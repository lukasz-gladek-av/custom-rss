			<p>It's no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> wasn't able to stand up to Battlefield 6 (and ARC Raiders). Even before release, the comparison between the two was unfavorable for Activision's game, and that proved to be correct once the two games launched. Black Ops 7 immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received criticism</a> for its inclusion of AI-generated 'slop' assets used for in-game rewards. Later, we learned that, at least in Europe, Black Ops 7's launch sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell short of Battlefield 6's by 63%</a>.</p>



<p>The development team has now acknowledged the wave of criticism <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a detailed blog post</a>. They explained that going forward, Call of Duty won't launch 'back-to-back' releases in the same subseries, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in an attempt to provide a more unique experience with each new title. That's what used to happen; as recently as between 2019 and 2021, the three main studios (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games) released Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War, and Vanguard. However, in the last four years, we got Modern Warfare 2 and 3 (by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, respectively), and then Black Ops 6 and 7, both of which were developed by Treyarch (with the help of Raven Software). In 2026, the ball should be back in Infinity Ward's court, and in 2027, Sledgehammer is rumored to be launching a new subseries.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty studios also vowed to 'drive meaningful, not incremental' innovation in the future, although what that looks like for a fairly formulaic series like this one remains to be seen. Anyway, the developers aren't going to abandon this year's release. In fact, they're saying that Season 01 is the 'largest live season ever' and that the game will receive 'unprecedented seasonal support until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games'. A lofty goal, to be sure. In the meantime, there will be a free trial and a Double XP weekend for Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies next week.</p>



<p>If you're planning to use the trial to try the game on PC, you may want to check the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-performance-benchmarks-the-fps-mason-what-do-they-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks article written by our Hardware team</a>.</p>

			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just surprised fans with the launch of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceedingly popular Nintendo Switch 2 platform</a>.</p>



<p>Granted, the game was already available to play on the Switch 2 for those who owned the Switch version, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated-for-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated</a> in May 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-is-now-available-on-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> in September 2022. However, this native version offers various technical enhancements.</p>



<p>The developer says that it takes 'full advantage' of the latest Nintendo console's hardware, including NVIDIA DLSS support:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing</li>



<li>Improved load times</li>



<li>Optimized performance</li>



<li>Joy-Con 2 mouse control support</li>



<li>Motion controls</li>



<li>Amiibo support</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the technical improvements, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is exactly the same as it was on the original Switch. Just like with that version, Nintendo users can enjoy three exclusive in-game items inspired by The Legend of Zelda franchise: the Master Sword, the Hylian Shield, and the Champion’s Tunic. New users can purchase the game for $59.99, while existing Switch users will be able to upgrade to the improved version for free.</p>

<p>Beyond that, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition includes the same content as it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it first released</a> on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on November 11, 2021, on the 10th anniversary of the original game's launch. </p>

</ul>



<p>That's the extent of the additional content you can get on the Nintendo Switch 2 (or the Nintendo Switch, for that matter) in Skyrim Anniversary Edition, since the game does not support the Creation Club menu on Nintendo's consoles, unlike PlayStation and Xbox consoles and, of course, PC. </p>



<p>By the way, if you've been hoping to see Skyrim's successor pop up any time soon, Bethesda's Todd Howard recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that The Elder Scrolls VI is still 'a long way off', and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-release-before-the-elder-scrolls-vi-todd-howard-practically-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will launch after GTA VI</a> in any case (meaning in 2027 at the earliest). </p>
