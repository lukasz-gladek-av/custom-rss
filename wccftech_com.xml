			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1283700/SUPERVIVE/">SUPERVIVE</a>, a free-to-play MOBA from developer Theorycraft Games and publisher NetEase Games, has launched with a 1.0 update on Steam, which, according to Theorycraft, brings an overhaul to the game, with the studio saying in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1283700/announcements/detail/516342322187730946">latest blog post </a>that "<em>almost everything has changed</em>."</p>



<p>One of the many changes, but perhaps the most significant one, is the introduction of the game's Armory, which includes a progression system for players to collect different gear that can drastically change their playstyle and craft new builds. The Breach, the game's setting, has also been expanded, and players can get around with improved gliders and a new vehicle called the Skyshark, as Theorycraft Games has added more aerial traversal options.</p>



<p>"<em>Our goal with the Armory is pretty straightforward: offer accessible, meaningful playstyle choices on top of an engaging meta-progression system,</em>" Theorycraft Games writes in its blog post. The studio breaks down the Armory in four basic steps. Collecting items for the armory, buying those items with the in-game currency Coin, performing well in matches to earn another in-game currency called Prisma, and then spending that Prisma to unlock more items for the Armory. </p>

<p>There are over 100 Armory items for you to collect and craft builds with, so there will always be something for you to go out and find, especially because your Armory will be reset at the end of each season. </p>

<p>Another big change with this launch update is the introduction of a new playable Hunter called Wukong, whose passive ability lets him hide out from enemies in trees to give his glider a rest before jumping back into the fray.</p>



<p>After launching in <a href="https://wccftech.com/supervives-open-beta-begins-today/">Open Beta</a> last November, SUPERVIVE has already been off to a strong start with thousands of positive reviews on Steam. Now that it's out in 1.0, hopefully Theorycraft Games can keep up the momentum the game has built, and we're not hearing about yet another free-to-play game <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">getting shut down within a year</a>.</p>
