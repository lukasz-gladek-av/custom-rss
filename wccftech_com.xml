			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched this year after an extremely long wait that left much of the industry baffled, but this wait didn't prevent the system from becoming a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/"><strong>smashing success</strong>.</a></p>



<p>However, it's undeniable that the new generation console by Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/"><strong>comes with some issues</strong></a>, including a <strong>long-standing controls issue</strong> which forced legendary game creator <strong>Hideki Kamiya</strong> to go to some <strong>extreme measures</strong> to fix: the <strong>lack of D-Pad on the Joy-Con controller</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20251219044/index_3.html#clo_kam">Japanese publication 4Gamer</a></strong> as part of its now traditional end-of-year wrap up with Japanese game developers, the creator of the <strong>Devil May Cry, Okami and Bayonetta</strong> series, among others, recounted his experience with the Nintendo Switch 2, finally managing to get his hands on a system only recently after purchasing a second system for his <strong>niece</strong>, who took his launch system for herself. Spending time with the system made Kamiya-san frustrated by the <strong>lack of a proper D-pad</strong> on the Joy-Con controllers.</p>



<p><em>"Even after it finally came back to me, for some reason, <strong>in this age of diversity, the manufacturer itself has stubbornly refused to offer the option of a 'Joy-Con with a D-pad'</strong> since the Switch 1. This just didn't fit into my gaming lifestyle, where I usually <strong>play while lying down</strong>, so I have no choice but to use the Joy-Con when playing games,"</em> he said, as translated by <strong><a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/2004712820403999129">Stealth</a></strong>, touching upon an issue many <strong>old-school gamers</strong> have had with the Nintendo Switch systems.</p>



<p>After continuing to use the original Switch for his daily <strong>Tetris 99</strong> fix and taking advantage of <strong>third-party peripherals</strong> with a proper D-pad, Kamiya-san decided to take matters into his own hands to make the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 his primary hardware</strong>. </p>



<p><em>"I purchased a new <strong>Cyber ​​Gadget 'mini grip with D-pad,'</strong> which I use with the Switch 1, and after some <strong>sanding and modifying</strong> it so that it could be attached to the Switch 2, where the <strong>button layout is slightly different</strong>, I was able to make my own <strong>'D-pad Joy-Con 2,'</strong> which finally allowed me to play titles from <strong>'Arcade Archives 2.'</strong>"</em></p>



<p>As someone who frequently plays old-school 2D games, I have long felt Hideki Kamiya's pain. Hopefully, Nintendo or third-party manufacturers will eventually address the issue and provide <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more controller options</strong> for those who think a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid D-pad is an essential part</strong> of any controller. As the Japanese company itself offers access to a catalog of older games via the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch Online</strong> subscription, it would make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">considerable sense</strong>.</p>

			<p>There is little doubt that the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched with <strong>far more third-party support</strong> than the original <strong>Switch</strong> did eight years ago. </p>



<p>Back then, the shift to a hybrid console was still a gamble, and Nintendo was coming off the colossal flop of the <strong>Wii U</strong>, which made third-party developers understandably wary of spending their precious resources on ports for the Switch. That meant only three third-party games were available in March 2017: Just Dance, Bomberman, and Skylanders. Not exactly heavy hitters. </p>



<p>Compare it with the Nintendo Switch 2 third-party launch lineup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Street Fighter 6 (Capcom)</li>



<li>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (CD Projekt Red)</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Avalanche Software / WB Games)</li>



<li>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (Capcom)</li>



<li>Split Fiction (Hazelight / EA)</li>



<li>No Man's Sky – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Hello Games)</li>



<li>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster (Konami)</li>



<li>Civilization VII – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (2K / Firaxis)</li>



<li>Hitman: World of Assassination – Signature Edition (IO Interactive)</li>



<li>Sonic X Shadow Generations (Sonic Team / Sega)</li>



<li>Fortnite (Epic Games)</li>
</ul>



<p>The incredible success of the original Switch and Nintendo's smart choice to pursue what is essentially a 2.0 edition with its successor made it far easier for developers to invest in supporting Nintendo's platform. So easy, in fact, that the problem reversed itself: now, there were too many developers who wanted to get access to the Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to the big studios obtaining priority access while many others were left wanting</a>, thus inevitably delaying their ability to release games on the console.</p>



<p>The situation <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still hadn't improved by July</a>. As recently as early October, we received word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-can-technically-do-path-tracing-war-thunder-dev-didnt-get-switch-2-devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive interview</a> that War Thunder developer Gaijin Entertainment had still not received its Nintendo Switch 2 developer kits. </p>



<p>Now, though, insider Nate the Hate (who had also confirmed in late August that many developers were still waiting for their kits) wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1py9h8n/natethehate_switch_2_devkit_availability_to_third/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the situation has 'largely been resolved'</a>.</p>



<p><em>In the case of Call of Duty… it doesn't mean they got a devkit super late, either. Just late enough that they couldn't get the work done to launch the game sooner. The devkit delivery situation has largely been resolved.</em></p>



<p>In the earlier portion of the statement, Nate was referring to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jez Corden's recent rumor</a> that Activision is preparing to launch a Call of Duty game for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 soon, thus abiding by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-year deal made by owner Microsoft with Nintendo</a> as part of the stipulations to get the Activision acquisition through the regulatory gates.</p>



<p>With more developers having access to Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, fans should prepare for a deluge of ports in 2026-2027, especially with the new console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outpacing its predecessor in sales figures</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami Is Aiming to Release a New Silent Hill Game in 2026, and in 2027, 2028, 2029, etc, “To Keep the Buzz Around Silent Hill Constant”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/konami-aiming-to-release-new-silent-hill-game-each-year-to-keep-buzz-constant/</link>
            <guid>1394074</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Before <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> was released in 2024, the most recent <strong>Silent Hill</strong> game was technically P.T. in 2014, the famous teaser that never became a full project. Before that, it was Silent Hill: Book of Memories on the PS Vita. Whether you count P.T. or not, that's still at least a decade between releases. Now, after Silent Hill 2 Remake in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">now Silent Hill f in 2025</a>, we've had two Silent Hill games in two years, and according to <strong>Konami</strong>, the company wants to keep that pace up if it can.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923?page=7">Famitsu</a> (via machine translation), producer <strong>Motoi Okamoto</strong> says the company is aiming "<em>to release about one [Silent Hill] title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles</em>," turning the long-dormant horror series into an annual franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Okamoto doesn't call this goal a new mandate for the company and the franchise. It doesn't seem to be the case that he wants Konami to have a Call of Duty-style development pipeline to ensure that they can pump out a new game on an annual basis. But he describes it as a goal the company would like to hit, in an effort to "<em>keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following the release of Silent Hill 2 in October 2024, we were able to deliver Silent Hill f in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track. We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We're not sure how far we can achieve this, but we'll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we'd like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>Could Konami set up its own production pipeline to make its horror franchise an annual series? Sure, it could; it's definitely a big enough company, and it could easily throw money at both establishing teams of developers internally and contracting other studios to make new games in the franchise each year. </p>



<p>It even theoretically has another two years of leeway to set up such a pipeline, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Bloober Team already working on a remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>, which could arrive in 2027, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">Silent Hill: Townfall set to arrive in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Is that what it should try to do with the series? That's a different question with a different, and more complex answer. Trying to push out new games in the series before they're ready could be the noose that Konami ties itself and hangs the series on. A quick glance at any game franchise that has annual releases, like EA Sports titles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty,</a> shows that you can't possibly keep up the level of quality we've seen, even with the previous two titles, year-in and year-out.</p>



<p>Keeping "<em>the buzz</em>," as Okamoto describes it, around the series, a constant factor could arguably be hampered by trying to release a new game every year. Especially as the quality of releases degrades, as it is likely to do with a new release annually. If Bloober Team is able to release the remake of the first game by 2027, and Townfall makes its rumoured 2026 release, then we'll see where Konami is at in 2027 with making what Okamoto describes as an ideal a reality.</p>

			<p>It's finally time to discover <strong>Wccftech's five best games of 2025</strong>. But first, let's take a moment to look at what happened this year in gaming.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was another year of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>heavy layoffs</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>studio closures</strong></a>, as the industry continues to readjust to the post-pandemic world and the challenges of a market entirely saturated with game releases that often steal each other's visibility. The other major topic of the year was the use of AI, which divided opinions within the development community and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culminated in the Larian controversy</a> when the studio admitted to using it during production to expedite certain basic tasks. It's easy to predict that this subject will be discussed more in the coming years, with further controversies likely to arise.</p>



<p>Thankfully, many great new releases brought fun and joy to all those who genuinely love this entertainment medium. When looking closer at the most unanimously acclaimed new titles launched this year, by the way, it's hard not to call 2025 the year of the indie-ish.</p>



<p>Some of the best games released this year were, after all, made by smaller studios with budgets that did not even approach the dozens or even hundreds of millions that the top studios can spend nowadays. Perhaps that's not so unheard of, but the difference is, those games tended to be the so-called 'rough gems', often featuring innovative mechanics but also a lot of 'jank' somewhere in the overall product due to a lack of resources. </p>



<p>This time, though, these games were almost as polished as the best triple-A examples, and often outshone them in innovation and ingenuity. That said, there were also some great AAA releases this year. Without further ado, keep scrolling to read our ten best games of 2025 and vote in the community poll.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/clair_obscur_expedition_33-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9.5</a>)</h2>



<p>The poster child of the small-team revolution is undoubtedly French developer Sandfall Interactive. With a budget of less than ten million dollars for their debut game, they proved that turn-based JRPGs are absolutely vital and that small developers can punch so far above their weight that they even outshine far bigger, critically acclaimed productions, breaking the existing record for most prizes won at an edition of The Game Awards with 9.</p>



<p>Most importantly, they delivered an amazing, unforgettable game in the hands of fans. Here's Francesco De Meo's summary from the Wccftech review:</p>



<p><em>Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hades-2-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-hades-ii-10">Hades II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10</a>)</h2>



<p>Despite being an independent company of a small size (around 25 employees), Supergiant Games is no stranger to having its games celebrated far and wide. Almost all of its games (Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades) received acclaim, and the first Hades even won several game awards. This time, though, they attempted a sequel and absolutely nailed it, as mentioned in David Carcasole's review:</p>



<p><em>Hades 2 is a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/silksong_art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong </h2>



<p>Team Cherry's latest game was also a sequel to a beloved indie title. The Australian team surprised everyone with the original Hollow Knight in 2017, selling over 15 million copies in eight years and garnering acclaim as one of the greatest Metroidvania games ever made. </p>



<p>However, the development of Silksong was quite long. It actually started even before the release of Hollow Knight as a DLC for that game, but then it morphed into a much larger project, and the developers went quiet for a very long time. In 2023, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced another delay</a>, and it wasn't until the latter half of this year that we got the very first details about Silksong, just in advance of its September 4 launch.</p>



<p>In the end, the long wait was absolutely worth it, as Silksong received heaps of praise for the game's artistic vision and its improvements to key systems, including combat, pacing, boss fights, and narrative. Silksong is a challenging game, but it's also fair, which is another feat that's far from easy to accomplish. Thus, it earns its rightful place among the best games of 2025.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a316285a09eceee300a8f0cb007599cf20aa6404a105a05a-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h2>



<p>Whereas both Silksong and Hades were sequels to beloved indie games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> came out of nowhere with a brand new IP. Granted, many of the members of AdHoc Studio had previously worked on Telltale's successful releases, but Dispatch was still a big surprise. Who knew that having to ditch a cool mech for a desk job would be so fun?</p>



<p>Seriously, though, the game is incredibly well-made in every regard, from the gorgeous comic-book-inspired art style to the witty dialogues, iconic characters, and engaging story that is as far removed from traditional superhero fare as you could imagine. At its budget price, it is practically a must-buy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SplitFiction_KeyArt_RGB-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8</a>)</h2>



<p>Hazelight Studios is another team that started small and slowly carved itself a niche for split-screen co-op exclusive games with interesting settings and stories. Their new game, Split Fiction, is every bit as enjoyable as A Way Out and It Takes Two, and even more refined in some areas. Critics and fans alike loved it; the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-becomes-million-seller-in-just-two-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became a million seller in just two days</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed four million units sold in two months</a>. There's even <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a movie on the way with Sydney Sweeney set to star</a> (in all likelihood, as Zoe Foster). If you have someone else who enjoys playing this type of game, getting it for co-op is a no-brainer.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-10">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10</a>)</h2>



<p>Warhorse Studios was once an independent studio as well. The first Kingdom Come: Deliverance was crowdfunded via Kickstarter, after all, but following that game's successful release, the Czech developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was acquired by THQ Nordic</a> (now Plaion). With a much larger budget at their disposal, they were able to create a much bigger, not to mention more refined, open world RPG that fully realizes their original vision. Chris Wray gave it a perfect ten and commented:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>

<p>Sucker Punch struck gold with Ghost of Tsushima, 2020's excellent action/adventure game. Their new IP sold exceptionally well, prompting Sony to get John Wick director Chad Stahelski to direct a movie adaptation and, of course, fast-tracking a sequel at the Bellevue-based studio. With Ghost of Yotei, the studio retained the same formula, refined it, and presented it with another great story that every samurai fan won't want to miss. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>

<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2>



<p>Hideo Kojima has returned this year with the second chapter in the post-apocalyptic adventures of Sam (Norman Reedus), this time set in Australia. The gameplay of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is much more varied than the first 'strand game', and there's also a vastly improved combat system. The presentation is simply unparalleled, and the performances of the whole cast are fantastic. </p>



<p>It may still not be for everyone, but Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is nonetheless undoubtedly worthy of appearing in our best games of 2025 list.</p>

<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9</a>)</h2>



<p>If you told most people a year ago that ARC Raiders would not only be in this list but also one of those with the best chances to win, they would not have believed it. Embark stunned everyone with how refreshing ARC Raiders turned out to be, not to mention incredibly well-balanced between its PvE and PvP elements. In Wccftech's review, Kai Tatsumoto wrote:</p>



<p><em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield-6-art-HD-1-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Out of all the games on this list, Battlefield 6 might have been the most anticipated in terms of sheer fanbase size coming into 2025. The excellent news for Battlefield fans is that their beloved military shooter franchise is back with a new installment that understands what made the best games in the saga so great. The natural outcome was for Battlefield 6 to become the best-selling game of the year, with estimates placing it near the 24 million units sold milestone.</p>



<p>In Wccftech's review, David Carcasole stated:</p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play.</em></p>

			<p>At the time of this writing, there are still just under 60 hours left in 2025, which means that the jury is still out on which game was the best-selling game of the year on the biggest PC storefront, Steam. That said, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025"><strong>Steam Charts</strong></a> has already declared the games that were part of the top 100 best-selling games by revenue on the platform, and while it doesn't list the titles in order, we know that some of the top 12 games include ARC Raiders, Schedule I, Hollow Knight Silksong, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>At least that's the case for the list of new games released in 2025. When you look at top sellers across the platform, including games not released in 2025, the top 12 look more like what you'd expect, with Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, PUBG, Apex Legends, and Marvel Rivals making up almost half of the top 12.</p>



<p>As for the new releases, however, the top 12 make it clear that games with a multiplayer focus are still the majority of what sells on the platform, with 9/12 games either featuring multiplayer or having multiplayer as the core element. But that's not to say single-player experiences aren't selling or essential to what players are looking for today.</p>



<p>Dune: Awakening may be a multiplayer game, but you can experience so much of it without really interacting with other players. Hollow Knight Silksong is an entirely solo journey, as is The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, all of which made the top 12.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top 12 best-selling new games on Steam for 2025, sorted randomly:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule I</li>



<li>Sid Meier's Civilization VII</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Dune: Awakening</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable element to this list is what's left off, specifically Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which was able to make the next tier of best-selling games, but couldn't beat Battlefield 6 and Borderlands 4, the two other first-person shooters you could argue are its biggest competition.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that, whatever your stance on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studio's use of GenAI</a>, it is incredibly impressive for ARC Raiders to arrive as a brand-new franchise and be one of the year's most popular, best-selling titles. ARC Raiders and Schedule I are the only two games that aren't based on a previously-existing franchise or series that made the list, and Schedule I's accomplishment is even more impressive when you factor in the fact that it's a self-published indie game.</p>



<p>The final tally will come after 2025 is officially over, and we'll get a list that's not in a random order once firms like Circana and Newzoo publish their findings. In the meantime, you can check out Wccftech's Best of 2025 lists, which include several of the top-selling games mentioned.
