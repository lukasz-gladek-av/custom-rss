			<p>Two Bungie leakers have come out publicly to say that Bungie has begun work on Destiny 3. The first to do so <a href="https://x.com/Bungie_Leaks/status/1993425004281639083" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was Bungie_Leaks</a>, a former leaker who stopped posting leaks a few months ago to avoid legal troubles with the developer. However, in this case, they are reposting information that was originally shared by another X user, <a href="https://x.com/starsiza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starsiza,</a> whose tweets are protected (meaning they can only be seen by those who have been approved). Beyond the Destiny 3 rumor, the tweet also mentions that 'something like a Destiny 2 classic game' has been greenlit, which the leaker claims is also the reason the D2 roadmap was recently delayed.</p>



<p>Around five hours later, trustworthy Bungie leaker Colony Deaks/Deakstiny <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated the report with the following tweet</a>:</p>



<p><em>Yes, Destiny 3 is in extremely early development. Some of you may have seen a tweet early this afternoon that mentioned that. We have been sitting on the info for a few weeks now and wanted to wait to talk about this seeing as it is in such an early state, and it just sucks to see others post about it carelessly for free internet points. We plan to share more info in the coming months as we wait on the larger scale things to develop and take shape. Sit tight.</em></p>



<p>When a follower asked about the other part of the original rumor (the one about a Destiny 2 Classic), Colony Deaks <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993526382517985702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that they currently have a lot of info on that front but are still working to confirm it.</p>



<p>Clearly, though, the big rumor here is Destiny 3. It's no secret that Destiny 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been registering all-time low players on Steam</a> after the launch of the Edge of Fate expansion. A couple of weeks ago, Bungie owner Sony even <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $204 million impairment loss caused by lower-than-expected Destiny 2 sales.</p>



<p>Perhaps this convinced both the developer and its parent company that the only way to reignite interest in the sci-fi franchise is to create a brand-new installment. Indeed, this seems to be the dominant sentiment within the community, with many former players vowing to only return if and when Bungie launches a new entry.</p>



<p>Granted, this is not the first time we've heard rumors about Destiny 3. The first ones stretch all the way back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-starting-development-destiny-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2018</a>, and then again <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>, just ahead of The Final Shape expansion that concluded the ten-year-long Light and Darkness saga. Just a few months later, however, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a third chapter was never in development up to that point. Bungie had been working on a different Destiny experience codenamed Payback, with original Destiny creative directors Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy leading, but that got canceled and the two developers left the studio. Bloomberg's report also said that the new strategy was to release smaller 'experience packs'. However, by now it's quite clear that this is not working, which might have forced them to reconsider. </p>



<p>Even if Destiny 3 is now really a thing that's secretly starting to take shape at the developer, it'd have a long road ahead of launch, given the current average triple-A game development cycle. We might not hear anything concrete for three, four, or even five years, so Destiny 2 is likely to keep going for a while longer.</p>



<p>On that note, Destiny 2 is getting the Star Wars-inspired Renegades expansion on December 2, and Bungie has just released a ViDoc and a launch trailer, as covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Death Stranding 2: On the Beach PC Version Rated by ESRB, Will Be Published by Sony]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-by-esrb-will-be-published-by-sony.1365025/</guid>

			<p>The PC version of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)</a> in the United States, suggesting that its launch is near. An official announcement may well come at The Game Awards, Geoff Keighley's show which features both awards for the best games of 2025 but also plenty of announcements for upcoming and existing titles. The Game Awards 2025 airs on Thursday, December 11.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the ESRB rating also reveals that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on PC, just as it was for the PS5 version. It's a change from the first game, which was published on PC by 505 Games. This is also surprising because Kojima Productions bought the publishing rights back from Sony and could have technically self-published this sequel. However, it may be that the studio doesn't yet have the necessary expertise or resources to self-publish, and as such, they are still relying on their partner, Sony. It'll be interesting to see whether the game ever makes it on Xbox like the previous installment and if so, if SIE will still publish there.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating is M for Mature (17+) with Blood and Gore, Partial Nudity, Strong Language, and Violence highlighted by the board. It's the same rating as the PlayStation 5 version, although that's not a surprise, as the content is likely to be identical.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launched on June 26, 2025, for PlayStation 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-estimated-to-have-sold-1-4-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling an estimated 1.4 million units in June</a> and earning more widespread acclaim than its predecessor. In the Wccftech review, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore. Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online.</em></p>
