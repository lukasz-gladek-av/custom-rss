			<p>Today, CAPCOM announced that the Resident Evil 4 Remake has broken the remarkable sales milestone of 10 million copies. The game initially launched in March 2023, so it's been a little over two years. Previous sales milestones included <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-surpass-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three million sold in the first two days</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four in just over a week</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five in less than four months</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-3-million-re4-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six and a half by the end of 2023</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-over-7-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven million around its first anniversary</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine million as of the end of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>In CAPCOM's list of all-time bestsellers, this puts the Resident Evil 4 Remake at the seventh spot, narrowly surpassing the Resident Evil 3 Remake but still around a million short of Resident Evil Village. Still, there's no doubt that this was a highly successful product. In time, it could overtake Resident Evil 2 Remake, which currently stands as CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time with 15 million units sold.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch noted a few of the game's faults, after remarking that it's still a very good game:</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 4 was the ultimate test of Capcom’s remake skills, and unfortunately, they buckled a bit under the pressure. The game suffers from minor mechanical issues and doesn’t reinvent or elevate the original material as boldly as some might have hoped it would. That said, Capcom hasn’t broken anything either as this is still a fun, inventive thrill ride that has been brought up to modern technical standards in striking fashion. The new Resident Evil 4 is well worth it for fans of the series, just keep your hopes slightly in check and you won’t be spin-kicked by inflated expectations.</em></p>
<p><em>I may be a bit disappointed by the scope and ambition of Capcom’s reimagining, but RE4 is still one of the most inventive and engaging action-horror games ever made, and this is a competent, technically-impressive new version of the game. The village battle may be largely the same, but it still gets your blood pumping. Same goes for the cabin defense sequence, your showdown with the village chief, or your first encounter with a Regenerator. The RE4 remake is still a fun, bombastic dose of mayhem, I just feel like it had the potential to be even better. It also suffers from the fact that Resident Evil Village was, in some ways, the bigger, crazier take on RE4 that this remake could have been.</em></p>
<p>According to rumors, this should be a big year for fans of the survival horror franchise, as CAPCOM is gearing up to reveal Resident Evil 9. When it comes to the next remake, the rumor is that it should be Code Veronica's turn, although <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it won't be as extensive as RE4</a>.</p>
