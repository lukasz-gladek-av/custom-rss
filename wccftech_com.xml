			<p>Today at <strong>CES 2026</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2026-ceo-jensen-huang-live-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong>, a new feature that will soon (later this month via an update available through the <strong>NVIDIA app</strong>) introduce dynamic visual effects capable of responding to in-game events.</p>



<p>The RTX Remix Logic system identifies <strong>over 30 common in-game events</strong> and offers <strong>more than 900 triggers</strong> that modders can use to transform visuals in their remastered classic PC games mods. The visual aspects of those games, such as lighting, materials, and volumetric effects, can now respond to gameplay. For example, opening a door might trigger changes in weather or light properties.</p>



<p>The modders can even inject dynamic particles or post-processing effects, such as chromatic aberration or vignettes, as stress signals when a player is in danger. Large-scale effects like snow or rain can be selectively applied so they appear only in specific environments and are automatically excluded from indoor areas.</p>



<p>RTX Remix Logic features an <strong>intuitive, no-code, node-based user interface</strong> that enables easy connection of various (900+) triggers. According to NVIDIA, the system is highly versatile and can be used in a multitude of ways. It is also extensible, enabling the RTX Remix community to add more game event triggers and actions over time. In a demonstration, NVIDIA showed that a door in Half-Life 2 RTX could open up to very different looking Ravenholms, as if the door connected to a multiverse. </p>

<p>Modders can even use RTX Remix Logic to <strong>introduce new gameplay systems</strong> to old PC games. For example, modder <strong>xoxor4d</strong> (the same one who's behind the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stunning GTA 4 path traced remaster</a></strong>) came up with the idea of adding a night vision effect to Half-Life 2 RTX that is automatically triggered when the user has equipped the crossbow and activated the zoom. You can check a showcase below.</p>

<p>The RTX Remix Logic system is compatible with <strong>over 165 classic games</strong> supported by NVIDIA's remastering, but that's not all that NVIDIA plans to add with the update slated for later this month. Modder xoxor4d has contributed a new look for the <strong>Remix Runtime menu</strong> and also made further customization possible, allowing users to resize it, retheme it, and change its transparency.</p>

<p>Overall, NVIDIA boasted that 2025 was <strong>a breakthrough year for RTX Remix</strong>, with over 50 new mods released and more than 20 community tools, including open-source contributions and plugins, now available to help expand compatibility.</p>
