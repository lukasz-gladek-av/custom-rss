			<p>When Cyberpunk 2077 was yet to be released, CD Projekt RED planned at least two major DLCs for the game, just like with The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, which received the widely acclaimed expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.</p>
<p>However, Cyberpunk 2077 shipped in a way buggier state than The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. On previous generation consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game's state was even more dire, requiring a lot of work from the developer to bring the level of polish that users had come to expect from CD Projekt RED.</p>
<p>That was a major reason behind the studio's decision to ultimately produce only one big DLC, Phantom Liberty, which launched in September 2023. Phantom Liberty was a resounding success, helping uplift the overall perception of Cyberpunk 2077 as a whole. Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I wrote back then</a>:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome</em></p>
<p>Phantom Liberty sold exceedingly well, too. Just a few days ago, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion surpassed 10 million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why the studio appears to be working on some additional DLC for the game. Some fans on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1l2x5z2/new_cyberpunk_dlc_being_written_and_developed_by/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the info from the LinkedIn profile of a Senior Writer at Virtuos (the company behind The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater):</p>
<p><em>• Analyzed existing Cyberpunk 2077 character voices to inform writing their dialogue in multiple new side quests. </em><br>
<em>• Coordinated with the Narrative Designer to conceive, write, and polish side quests for upcoming DLC releases. </em><br>
<em>• Worked with the English Adaptation Specialist to ensure all in-game dialogue and text adhered to English/American and Cyberpunk standards using Red Engine tools. </em></p>
<p>To be clear, though, it is unlikely that this DLC would be something even remotely as large as Phantom Liberty. More likely is a bundle of new DLC missions, or perhaps even a tie-in of sorts with another Cyberpunk 2077-themed Netflix anime following Edgerunners.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we'll be sure to report any further evidence of a new DLC that arises.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/arkanes-deathloop-is-free-for-a-week-on-the-epic-games-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next three free games on the<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deathloop"> Epic Game Store</a> have been revealed, and this time the list includes Arkane Lyon's latest game,<a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-and-dishonored-are-set-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/"> Deathloop</a>.</p>
<p>Ogu and the Secret Forest from Sinkhole Studio and Moonlab Studio is the other game, along with Deathloop, that's available to redeem from now until next week on <strong>June 12, 2025</strong>, before Two Point Hospital is the following free game players can pick up from <strong>June 12-19.</strong></p>
<p>Deathloop is the most recent release from beloved studio Arkane Lyon, the team behind Dishonored. It's also the last game <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-director-arkane-austin-closure-gut-stab-redfall-development-ceases/">Arkane Lyon fully worked on in collaboration</a> with their sister studio, Arkane Austin. The Austin-based division, the team that led development on Prey, was also the team to lead development on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-redfall-refunds/">Redfall</a>. After the vampire shooter failed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-austin-studio-director-gives-emotional-goodbye-to-colleagues-wonders-about-the-sweet-spot-team-size/">Microsoft shut the Austin team down and laid everyone off</a>.</p>
<p>Deathloop, Ogu, and Two Point Hospital replace Tiny Tina's Wonderland and Limbo, which were free for the past week, and are the last free games for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/">Epic Games Store 2025 Mega Sale</a>, before Epic goes back to its regular cadence of free games.</p>
<p>Since the sale began on May 15, Epic has given away nine games, including today's new freebies. Here's the full list of what you could have grabbed since last month, with only the bottom two available now until June 12.</p>
