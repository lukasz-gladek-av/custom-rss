			<p>In just five days, KOEI TECMO will publish Rise of the Ronin on PC. The action roleplaying game was originally launched nearly a year ago as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, published by Sony itself on the console. That's nearly the same amount of time that passed between the PlayStation and PC launches of Nioh, which evidently featured a similar timed exclusivity deal.</p>
<p>Rise of the Ronin clearly has a lot in common with Nioh, although it goes for a different type of experience, more akin to something like Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed. For a full review of the game, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kai's original article</a>. Here, I'll focus on the technical aspects of the upcoming PC version.</p>
<p>Developer Team Ninja once again used KOEI TECMO's proprietary Katana Engine, a technology already seen in previous games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dynasty-warriors-9-east-west-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Hearts</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>. All these games had something in common: huge technical issues. Unfortunately, Rise of the Ronin is no exception. Even on a top-of-the-line PC configuration, the game struggles to provide smooth frame rates, to say nothing of the mediocre visual quality.</p>
<p>On the surface, the developer does offer support for modern features like support for the DualSense controller's Adaptive Triggers, High Dynamic Range mode for HDR displays, NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Resolution (DLSS) or Deep Learning Anti Aliasing (DLAA), AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 3, Intel XeSS, NVIDIA and AMD Frame Generation, and even ray tracing, though only for the reflections. There are also several graphics settings that can be used to customize the experience, including the ability to turn off annoying filters like vignette and chromatic aberration, which is appreciated. The frame rate can only go up to 120 frames per second (60 in the cutscenes), which is a shame, although Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is guilty of the same - and modders will likely remove this limit shortly.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Custom Benchmark While Roaming in Yokohama</figcaption></figure>
<p>What's really disappointing is the performance. On a rig equipped with the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, a game like Rise of the Ronin should run fast and smooth, but that's not the case at all. Simply roaming around the city of Yokohama averages just 64 frames per second at 4K resolution with every setting maxed out and NVIDIA's DLAA plus Frame Generation enabled. Worse, it feels quite stuttery, too. According to FLAT (Frame Latency Analytics Tool), over 14% of the frame time during the benchmark was spent under stuttering conditions.</p>
<p>This is easily the worst performance I've seen since I set up this PC, and it's not like it comes with some sort of visual spectacle, either. Sure, Rise of the Ronin looks better than KOEI TECMO's previous titles and also has a larger explorable world, but that's not saying much. Even with DLAA turned on, shimmering and aliasing are still noticeable, an issue that I spotted in Nioh and Wo Long, too. Moreover, several assets are evidently in very low resolution despite the game taking up 151.6 GB of your drive's space after the installation.</p>

<p>I wouldn't at all be surprised to see the game launch to very mixed user reviews on Steam, with technical complaints sure to be cited in the comments. It's a shame because the game itself is interesting enough, but from a technical standpoint, Assassin's Creed Shadows looks set to slaughter it. Usually, I would tell you to wait for the developer to improve the game's performance through patches, but KOEI TECMO doesn't exactly have a great track record of doing that. Of course, I'd be happy to see that trend change. On GeForce RTX 50 GPUs, it would definitely help if NVIDIA whitelisted the game to take advantage of the NVIDIA Override capability to use the latest DLSS transformer model and possibly Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>However, that would just brute force through the game's worst issues. Judging from the repeated technical disappointments offered by the studio's latest games, I would recommend they switch to Unreal Engine as they did for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> remaster. Granted, Epic's game-making technology is not without its problems, but it's certainly far more advanced than what they have.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has announced that Monster Hunter Wilds is now available to play via the GeForce NOW cloud. CAPCOM's new game recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> sales records (over eight million units in just three days), and now it'll open up to a new audience, allowing even those without a powerful PC or console to join the hunt via the GeForce NOW app on any PC, Shield TV devices, Mac, and compatible TVs and smartphones.</p>
<p>It's a big week overall for GeForce NOW users, who also get support for the free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game FragPunk and Hazelight's latest title, Split Fiction. The latter game earned an 8 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Birch's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, NVIDIA's cloud platform also supports the newly launched action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished. The game developed by Eko Software is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863430/Dragonkin_The_Banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out now in early access</a> and you can read Francesco De Meo's thoughts <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</em></p>
<p>The weekly GeForce NOW roundup also includes the following previously released games which, however, are now supported on other stores:</p>
<p>● Ghostrunner 2 (Epic Games Store)<br>
● Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (Epic Games Store)<br>
● Prey (Epic Games Store, Steam, and Xbox available on PC Game Pass)</p>

			<p>Sometimes, it's really hard to let some things go, even for a legendary game creator such as Hideki Kamiya, who seems to have some trouble forgetting the <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/">canceled Xbox exclusive Scalebound.</a></p>
<p>In a new studio update video from Clovers, Kamiya-san's new development studio, which is currently working on an Okami sequel in collaboration with CAPCOM, the creator of the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta series, among other excellent action games, was shown reminiscing about Scalebound while looking at footage and trailers shared online back when the game was still in active development. Despite the project having been canceled eight years ago, it still holds an important place in Kamiya-san's heart, as he would love to make it again someday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Let’s do it, Phil ! 😀 <a href="https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt">https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt</a></p>
<p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1896473842950041682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Microsoft seems interested in resuming old partnerships with Japanese development studios, as shown earlier this year with the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/">Ninja Gaiden 4 and the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, there could be some interest from the publisher in working together with Hideki Kamiya's new studio for another project which could incorporate some of the features that the legendary creator liked so much in Scalebound. Since the project has only been briefly mentioned a couple of times since its cancelation, and not in <a href="https://wccftech.com/scalebound-rough-development-missed-milestones-stopped-payments-kamiya-takes-time-health/">the best of lights</a>, however, it definitely feels like that ship has sailed, never to come back.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, Hideki Kamiya's new studio, Clovers, is working on a new entry in the Okami series in collaboration with CAPCOM. The game, which will be released on PC and consoles on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date, will be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">RE Engine</a>, which is allowing the studio to fully realize Kamiya-san's vision.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mod-addresses-stuttering-issues-caused-by-anti-tamper-tech.1126728/</guid>

			<p>Many of the Monster Hunter Wilds performance issues on PC may have become a thing of the past, thanks to a new version of a popular mod available for all games powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, modder Praydog released a new version of the REFramework mod, which significantly reduces the micro-stuttering issues caused by the game's anti-tamper tech by preventing constant scanning. The mod also addresses some crashing issues caused by DRM as well. You can find this new version of the mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, but if you're having issues with it like other users are reporting, you can use any of the previous nightly builds available on <a href="https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> that seem to be more stable as of now.</p>
<p>Performance issues aren't the only issues that impact the Monster Hunter Wilds experience, as the low challenge level for the story and a good portion of the postgame High Rank can be a little offputting for those who mastered previous generation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. Thankfully, some mods are already available to address the low challenge level of the game, allowing hunters to<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/"> increase both monsters' health and attack power.</a></p>
<p>The above issues aside, Monster Hunter Wilds is undoubtedly among the finest entries in the series. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
