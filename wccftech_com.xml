			<p>Following the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> show, <strong>Xbox Game Studios</strong> head Craig <strong>Duncan</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-studios-changes-leadership-rares-craig-duncan-steps-into-the-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formerly head of <strong>Rare</strong></a>) was <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Gamesradar</a>, with a particular focus on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fable</strong> reboot</a>, arguably the showcase's centerpiece. The executive called Fable 'mindblowing', sharing his excitement particularly for the <strong>Living Population</strong> feature, which will allow players to interact with the NPCs in many different ways.</p>



<p><em>When I think about Playground and their history with the Forza Horizon franchise, and their desire to take on Fable as a franchise, I think it's really about this relentless pursuit of excellence. We all know what that means in Forza Horizon, we've all seen that franchise get bigger and bigger every year, but what does that mean for Fable? I have played a bunch of the game, I've messed around with the combat and the Living Population, and it's just mind blowing. I'm so excited that we talked about it in the Developer Direct, because it's something that people wouldn't expect.</em></p>



<p><em>There were some really special ideas in the original Fable trilogy, but what I think Playground has done is take some of these ideas and modernized them – my brain pops every time I think about the Living Population, how it works, and what it adds to the overall game; it's an incredible invention, and Fable is going to be an incredible RPG. It will be amazing to see what players do with it, and it'll be massively shareable.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Duncan acknowledged some inconsistencies in Xbox Game Studios' multiplatform releases. For example, at the Xbox Developer Direct, Fable and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/double-fine-productions-kiln-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double Fine's Kiln</a></strong> were announced to launch day-and-date on PlayStation 5 (as well as PC and Xbox), whereas <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a></strong> will launch on PC and Xbox first. Duncan said the goal is to be more consistent in the future, but he also clarified that it may not always be the same, depending on the game and the resources behind it.</p>



<p><em>There's always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. When a strategy changes, maybe you've got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can't. So that's why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we're going to work on that, and we're going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</em></p>



<p><em>But you know, for our game makers, if you're on the Fable team you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team's doing. That's always our goal. It's rarely more complicated than that. It's like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</em></p>



<p>In other Fable news, Playground's Game Director Ralph Fulton <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-lead-confirms-mockumentary-style-is-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the action RPG <strong>will actually feature the mockumentary style</strong> we've seen in previous trailers in the game itself, inspired by the hit show '<strong>The Office</strong>'. We won't have to wait too long to see whether it's a good fit, as the game <strong>now has a Fall 2026 release window</strong>, with more details expected to be shared in the next months.</p>

<p>Can an MMO developer deliver a kick-ass open world action/adventure game with RPG elements? That's the unspoken question behind <strong>Crimson Desert</strong>. South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> achieved incredible success with their debut game, 2014's MMORPG <strong>Black Desert Online</strong> (known simply as Black Desert on consoles). In February 2024, almost ten years after the game's original PC launch, the studio could boast a player base of <strong>over 55 million users</strong> across all platforms (including mobile) and a lifetime revenue of <strong>more than $2 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>With all this money, Pearl Abyss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired CCP Online</a></strong>, the maker of <strong>EVE Online</strong>, and conceived several new projects, three of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were announced at G-Star 2019</a>: the shooter <strong>Plan 8</strong>, which hasn't been mentioned in a long time; the creature-collecting game <strong>DokeV</strong>, still in development; and Crimson Desert, which had its own lengthy development phase but is now very close to being available.</p>

<h2 id="release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, and Pricing</h2>



<p id="h-release-date-platforms-and-pricing">The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally meant to launch in <strong>Winter 2021</strong></a>, but Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opted for an indefinite delay</a> as it reworked several aspects of the game. The developers went silent for a couple of years and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at Gamescom 2023</a> with an awesome new trailer. From that point, Crimson Desert communication became more regular, eventually leading to an official <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fall 2025</strong> launch window</a>. The team needed a little more time, though, and delayed it to Q1 2026, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formalized as the final release date of <strong>March 19, 2026</strong></a>. We can now add that <strong>further delays are unlikely</strong>, as Pearl Abyss confirmed a few days ago that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-release-date-gone-gold-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game has reached gold status</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Crimson Desert will be available on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S and X</strong>. There are three editions available for pre-order: </p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: <strong>$70</strong> (base game only)</li>



<li>Deluxe Edition: <strong>$90</strong> physical / <strong>$80</strong> digital. The physical one includes a steelbook case, developer letter, Greymane brooch pin, three character photo cards, three patches, fabric map, and in-game DLC: Kairos Plate Set armor, Balgran Shield, Exclaire Horse Tack Set. The digital one, as you'd expect, only includes the in-game DLC. </li>



<li>Collector's Edition: <strong>$499.99</strong> (all the above, as well as a 17-inch diorama of Kliff versus the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gameplay-shows-off-boss-fight-against-mechanical-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Star mechanical dragon</a>)</li>
</ul>



<p>All pre-orders of the game will receive the <strong>Khaled Shield</strong> in-game item.</p>

<h2 id="genre-setting-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert can be best described as a <strong>single player open world action/adventure game with RPG elements</strong>. It is set in a medieval fantasy world, specifically the large continent of <strong>Pywel</strong>, where multiple factions fight for control of the land. </p>



<p>The protagonist, <strong>Kliff Macduff</strong>, is a seasoned mercenary of the <strong>Greymanes</strong>, a kinship-bound fighting order. <strong>The Greymanes are, however, struck down at the very beginning of the narrative</strong>, when the <strong>Black Bears faction</strong> ambushes and decimates them, scattering survivors across Pywel. From there onward, <strong>Kliff's mission is to reunite his scattered order</strong>, including Oongka, Yann, and Naira, and exact revenge on the enemy leader <strong>Myurdin</strong>, but there's more at play in the political landscape amid a broader collapse of centralized authority. <strong>The King of Demeniss has fallen into a mysterious coma</strong>, creating a power vacuum that various factions, including the aforementioned Black Bears, other warlords, and even ancient forces, are seeking to exploit to gain control.</p>



<p>Kliff, an unlikely political player, <strong>is tasked with protecting an artefact of unclear significance</strong> while rebuilding his mercenary company. Based on what Pearl Abyss has shared so far, the narrative will emphasize themes of <strong>leadership under duress</strong>, <strong>the cost of survival</strong>, and <strong>redemption</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay Features and Mechanics</h2>



<p>As briefly touched upon earlier in this roundup, Crimson Desert had to be massively reworked before it could be released. That's because <strong>it was initially unveiled as an MMO-like game</strong> in the vein of Black Desert. The story of Macduff and his crew was already there, but so were many MMO features, which were eventually removed until <strong>it became a single-player-only game</strong>.</p>



<p>The developers have instead doubled down on creating a massive and immersive open world game. The studio recently confirmed that size estimates put the continent of Pywel at <strong>twice the size of Skyrim</strong> in The Elder Scrolls V, and it's also <strong>larger than the already big playable map of Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>. The game world is completely seamless (there will be little to no loading screens), and traversal options include horseback riding, <strong>dragonback flight</strong>, mechanical mech with jet propulsion, and climbing/parkour mechanics. </p>



<p>There will be plenty of side content, including <strong>non-combat activities like fishing, cooking, hunting, arm wrestling, sheep wrangling, and horse taming</strong>. However, <strong>the fighting is central to Crimson Desert</strong> and features incredible complexity. Pearl Abyss took inspiration from retro arcade fighting games, such as Samurai Showdown, Final Fight, and King of Fighters, rather than contemporary Soulslikes. The combat system includes multi-button combinations, linked attacks, and more. It'll require more time to master than the average action/adventure game, that's for sure, but it could also be the game's defining feature when it's all said and done.</p>



<p>Kliff's combat toolkit lets players choose between <strong>swords, spears, bows, spells, grapples, wrestling throws, Taekwondo kicks (which were motion-captured from martial artists), and punches</strong>. Defensive mechanics feature stamina-draining blocks, precise parries that enable counterattacks, and dodge rolls with perfect dodge windows restoring the stamina resource. Furthermore, interaction with the environment can also be exploited by throwing enemies into hazards, igniting fire traps, toppling structures, detonating magical spells mid-air, and exploiting weakpoints.</p>



<p><strong>There is, of course, equipment customization</strong>. Various armor sets (helm, chest, gloves, boots, cloaks, rings, amulets) offer different stat modifiers, like defense (physical/magical mitigation), health/stamina pools, resistance to specific damage types (fire, ice, elemental), skill cooldown reductions, and damage boosts for weapon types. </p>



<h2 id="tech-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert runs on the proprietary <strong>Black Space Engine</strong>, which the South Korean studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed in depth during a GDC 2025 presentation attended by Wccftech</a>. Black Space was <strong>designed to render vast, fully seamless open worlds without sacrificing details</strong>. It is <strong>powered by several simulation systems</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dynamic weather</li>



<li>Cloth, hair, trees, and grass behave believably and are affected by wind movement</li>



<li>Environments that support real-time destructibility</li>



<li>Highly realistic waves, currents, and ripples thanks to the engine's FFT Ocean simulation and Shallow Water simulation</li>



<li>Volumetric fog and detailed atmospheric scattering effects, and dynamic weather</li>



<li>Ray tracing</li>
</ul>



<p id="h-tech-and-specs">On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-little-nightmares-iii-and-crimson-desert-all-launching-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been confirmed to support <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong></a> for GeForce RTX users. AMD users can also look forward to <strong>three FSR RedStone</strong> features: <strong>Upscaling</strong>, <strong>Frame Generation</strong>, and <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong>.</p>
