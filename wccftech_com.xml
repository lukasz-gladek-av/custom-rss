			<p>Ahead of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls being playable at <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/22/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-debuts-at-evo-2025/">EVO 2025</a>, developer Arc System Works has showcased our first extended look at gameplay through a beginner's guide, a fitting delivery method for anyone who plans to be at EVO this year and wants to jump into the ring with at least some knowledge of how things work. </p>



<p>Announced last month during <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">PlayStation's State of Play event</a>, this new fighter from Arc System Works is a new 4v4 fighting game, and while we're sure to see plenty of gameplay when members of the public are able to get their hands on it, this video diving into the basics is the most we've seen of the game so far.</p>



<p>The only unfortunate thing about it is that it's a relatively slow showcase of gameplay, and we see more of only one character, Captain America, than we do of the other fighters that'll be available at launch. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>That said, it's a very thorough guide, and if you are going to EVO with the intent of waiting in line to check out Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, then you could call this video required viewing to ensure you're ready for the fight.</p>



<p>While players will be able to see even more of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls at EVO 2025, and get to play it, they won't get to try it out with PlayStation's new fight stick, which we recently learned is officially called <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike</a>. The FlexStrike will be at EVO, but behind glass cages for players to look and not touch.</p>

			<p>A lot of thought went into when to release Battlefield 6, but EA continued to target this Fall, regardless of Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">Variety</a>, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele commented on the release date of the highly anticipated next entry in the first-person shooter series, saying that they <em>"have always have been heads down, unblinking about this fall and executing at a level of excellence,"</em> working hard with the development team to not get distracted by anything else happening around them. With the level of effort and investement put into the game, however, the last thing the publisher wanted was to put Battlefield 6 in harm's way or too close to the release of something really large, so EA did have their eye on Grand Theft Auto VI, and were thinking about different scenarios, but weren't allowing these scenarios to impact schedules or development.</p>



<p>The confidence EA is showing in Battlefield 6 definitely seems to be warranted. Kai recently had the chance to try out the game and has found it to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">a return to proper form</a> after the blunders of the last entries in the series. </p>



<p><em>In a lot of ways, Battlefield 6 is how DICE and Ripple Effect have listened to the feedback from fans and brought back the massive squad shooter in a proper return to form. Despite the mayhem of crumbling infrastructure, this is exactly what I’ve wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs.</em></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">October 10</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
