			<p>As is customary for any game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-marathon-release-date-following-xbox-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirms a release date and opens up pre-orders</a>, <strong>Bungie</strong> revealed the official <strong>Marathon</strong> PC system requirements by updating the store page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <strong>Steam</strong></a>.</p>



<p>The good news is that any PC released in the past six to nine years should be able to run the game. The minimum graphics card requirement is either <strong>NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1050 Ti</strong> (released in <strong>October 2016</strong>) or <strong>AMD's Radeon RX 5500 XT</strong> (launched in <strong>December 2019</strong>). Intel's option, the <strong>ARC A580</strong>, is much more recent, having been released in <strong>October 2023</strong>, but that's only because Intel entered the GPU market much later.</p>



<p>Overall, it is quite obvious that Bungie aims for Marathon to be playable on a vast number of computers, making the extraction shooter accessible to as many users as possible.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Marathon</strong> <strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>MINIMUM</strong></th><th><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</td><td>Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>8 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (4 GB) / Intel Arc A580 (8 GB, with ReBAR on)</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2060 (6 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (8 GB) / Intel Arc A770 (16 GB, with ReBAR on)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Then again, this was always their philosophy, even with 2017's <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. For comparison, we've also included the PC system requirements of Bungie's previous game release. Marathon runs on an evolved version of the proprietary Destiny 2 '<strong>Tiger</strong>' engine, after all.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Destiny 2</strong> <strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>MINIMUM</strong></th><th><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3 3250 3.5 GHz or Intel Pentium G4560 3.5 GHz / AMD FX-4350 4.2 GHz</td><td>Intel Core i5 2400 3.4 GHz or i5 7400 3.5 GHz / AMD Ryzen R5 1600X 3.6 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>6 GB RAM</td><td>8 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB or GTX 1050 2GB / AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB or GTX 1060 6GB / AMD R9 390 8GB Memory 8 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>105 GB available space</td><td>105 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Anyway, the most interesting aspect of the Marathon PC system requirements is that they really open the door to a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> port. On paper, Nintendo's hybrid console should definitely have enough power to run the game, especially since it supports NVIDIA DLSS, whereas the GTX 1050 Ti does not. </p>



<p>Bungie Game Director <strong>Joe Ziegler</strong> did comment on this very topic <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/39409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Japanese website Famitsu</a>. This was shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 in April 2025. Ziegler replied:</p>



<p><em>At the moment, we don't have any plans to add any other compatible hardware, but we will consider doing so in the future.</em></p>

			<p>Two days ahead of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong> showcase, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st has shared</a> a <strong>Fable leak</strong> featuring lots of concept art created by <strong>Playground Games</strong>. This is a great way to assess the game's visual style, if nothing else, as well as to preview some of the locations that players will find in the game during their explorations.</p>



<p>For example, one of the images shows a sign for <strong>Bloodstone</strong>. Those who played Fable II might remember that in that game, it was a modest-sized port town that harbored criminals and pirates. Geographically, it was surrounded by the deadly swamp, <strong>Wraithmarsh</strong>, to the north, east, and west, and by the ocean to the south, making it virtually isolated from the rest of <strong>Albion</strong>. </p>



<p>Besides Bloodstone, the concept art pictures are a mixture of scenic environmental shots of rolling hills and forests and creepy dungeon-like locations. </p>

<p>According to official info shared by Microsoft, the Xbox Developer Direct 2026 showcase, airing on Thursday, January 22 at 10 AM Pacific Time, <strong>will offer the first proper, in-depth look at the Fable reboot</strong>. Indeed, even the official X account of the game wrote:</p>



<p><em>We’ve been working on Fable for a really, really long time. It’s time to show you more. Much more. Tune in to Developer_Direct at 10 AM PT (6 PM GMT) on 22nd Jan for our first deep dive into the game.</em></p>



<p>The very first rumor that Playground, developer of Forza Horizon (also featured in its sixth incarnation in the showcase), would undertake the considerable effort of bringing back the fantasy action RPG series originally created by <strong>Lionhead</strong>, appeared in <strong>early 2018</strong>. It's therefore been at least <strong>eight years of waiting</strong> for fans, though it might not be long before they can actually play the game, given that it is scheduled to launch this year on PC and Xbox Series S|X. According to VGC sources, Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/playground-fable-rumored-launch-day-date-ps5-forza-horizon-6-wont-wasnt-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might also launch on <strong>Sony's PlayStation 5</strong> at the same time</a>, though this remains unconfirmed. </p>
