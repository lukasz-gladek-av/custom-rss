			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-2-billion-year-revenue/">Xbox</a> and Microsoft have put a date on its summertime showcase, with the announcement that the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will be livestreamed on <strong>Sunday, June 8, 2025 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT.</strong></p>
<p>Similarly to how previous Xbox showcases have featured a Direct-like show on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-starfield-direct-breaks-viewership-records-for-xbox/">Starfield</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/">Call of Duty</a> immediately after the general showcase, it's The Outer Worlds 2's turn to get its own featured Direct following the rest of the showcase.</p>
<p>Beyond The Outer Worlds 2, Xbox isn't giving any hints yet as to what will be shown at this direct.&nbsp;<span>The June 8 date is, however, right towards the tail-end of<a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-comes-to-los-angeles-again-from-june-6-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Summer Game Fest 2025,</a> which takes place from June 6-9.</span> With how many bits of news and leaks happen around that time, we'll surely have a better idea of what this showcase will look like closer to the actual date.</p>
<p>Whether Microsoft tells us about what'll be shown or not, Xbox does mention that this Xbox Games Showcase will be just a digital live stream, meaning there won't be a physical show component to it as they've done in the past.</p>
<p>Xbox also clarifies that the games shown will be both from Xbox's "<em>first-party studios, in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe</em>," an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/">Xbox Wire</a> blog post reads.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is the sequel to the fairly successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 sci-fi roleplaying game</a> published by Private Division. This one, though, will be published by Xbox Game Studios, which means Obsidian will have enjoyed a higher budget during development. The expectations are certainly higher, especially after Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-is-looking-incredible-says-obsidian-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyped it up as something 'incredible'</a>.</p>
<p>Fans of the first game may be disappointed to learn that it will feature a new cast of characters. The journey will also take them to a new solar system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Atlus has announced that an extensive Persona 3 Reload demo is now available on all platforms. The demo allows would-be players to play through the storyâ€™s opening, leading up to the first major boss battle against a Shadow. It's a section of several hours, making it a rather meaty demo compared to the usual half-hour slice. Moreover, as usual with demos nowadays, you can play through the whole thing and then continue where you left off after you purchase the game.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload launched in early 2024 to critical and commercial acclaim. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 9 out of 10</a> by reviewer Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Persona 3 Reload is gorgeous; it looks like one of the more modern Persona titles, and it manages to bring this new visual overhaul without sacrificing what is one of the darker atmospheres you'll find in a game like this. It adds a fresh feel to the game while still keeping it familiar, which is something all remakes/reloads could remember to do. From brand-new models and portraits to new menus, ATLUS hasn't skimped.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, I want to say it plays immaculately on the Steam Deck. There are no hiccups; it is smooth, responsive, and looks fantastic. Overall, Persona 3 Reload is precisely as my title says: "a remake as it should be". Yes, aspects are missing from previous versions, so you couldn't arguably call this a definitive edition of Persona 3. Still, in my opinion, it's undoubtedly the best version of Persona 3 you'll find.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after the game's debut, Atlus <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-is-the-fastest-selling-game-in-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted</a> that it was the fastest-selling game in the whole Persona franchise. We know it has sold one million copies in its first week, though there haven't been any updated sales figures since.</p>
