			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost mode can bring significant improvements in terms of image quality and performance even in games that haven't been patched to take advantage of all the system's features, a new analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In a new video shared over the weekend, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at how the current-generation Final Fantasy games run on the mid-generation system released last month. Being the only PS5 Pro Enhanced title, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is clearly the star of the show. In the new Versatility Mode only available on PlayStation 5 Pro, the second entry in the Remake series features improved image clarity and more stable performance over Performance Mode in pretty much every scenario. In combination with a small resolution boost over the base model, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler delivers some impressive results, although with some issues that are unique to the game, such as vegetation issues both at a distance and up close, and common among games using the current iteration of the upscaler, which should become a thing of the past in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">future versions</a>.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting with the other current-generation Final Fantasy games, as none of them have received PlayStation 5 Pro patches. Final Fantasy XVI, for example, shows significant improvements in both display modes. In Graphics mode, for example, Game Boost Mode allows the game to run at a higher internal resolution, which results in clearer and more detailed image. Performance Mode sports a far smaller internal resolution boost but considerably more stable performance with a 24% uplift, which often falls into the system's VRR range. In scenarios where the base model struggles to hit 60 FPS, the PS5 Pro manages to do so consistently. In addition, the game's combination of TSC MAA and FSR 1 leaves much of the image pixel structure intact, resulting in less aliasing on the mid-generation system.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XIV improvements are more significant on the PlayStation 5 Pro with Game Boost, with an up to 40% performance improvement in 4K mode with dynamic resolution off. On the new system, the game manages to hit 60 FPS consistently, and only the most intense scenarios cause drops. At 1440p resolution, the game also often manages to hit 120 FPS, resulting in great image fluidity. Even Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origins sports more stable performance on the PlayStation 5 Pro without a dedicated patch, which is a significant improvement for an intense action game like the spin-off developed by Team NINJA.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro offers a variety of new features over the base model, which make it a compelling upgrade for those looking to experience console games at their best despite its high price.

			<p>A new STALKER 2 patch is now live on PC, addressing some crashing issues and a few other issues.</p>
<p>The 1.1.3 patch, which has been confirmed to be the last patch of the year for the game, is considerably smaller than the previous patch in both size and scope. Weighting around 7.4 GB, the patch focuses on fixing a small selection of issues, introducing a temporary solution to avoid crashes on shader compilation by skipping shaders warm up, as well as addressing a few access violation error crashes, an issue when invert axis options could not be saved after restarting the game and another issue where controls could be lost after shooting, reloading and then examing the artifact. The detailed patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525330030617690996?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new STALKER 2 patch is much smaller in scope than the previous one, which addressed over <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-1-performance-improvements/">1800 issues</a>, improved the A-Life system, and improved optimization, among other things. Performance was also improved on RTX 3000 series cards with AMD frame generation, although the minor improvements show how there's still plenty of work to be done in this regard.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by GSC World by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>
