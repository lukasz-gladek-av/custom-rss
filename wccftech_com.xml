			<p>The Battlefield 6 beta is now open to everyone, and the concurrent users peak on Steam (the only platform where we can reliably check it, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to SteamDB</a>) has already surpassed 470K. It's entirely likely that it will break through 500K concurrent users before this beta weekend is over. As a reminder, playing this weekend will guarantee the unlock of two skins (Seeker Soldier and All-Terrain Soldier), the Dominion weapon package, two weapon stickers, and the Lights Out player card background. Playing during the next weekend (from Thursday, August 14 to Sunday, August 17) will provide access to the War Machine vehicle skin, the Striking Distance weapon package, and the Bat Company dog tag.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 introduced a kernel-level anticheat that requires the SecureBoot feature to be enabled on PC.  Even so, there were plenty of cheat attempts, as relayed by the SPEAR Anti-Cheat Team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3081410/discussions/0/600786083350058140/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a post on the Steam forum</a>:</p>



<p><em>Since the launch of Open Beta Early Access:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.</em></li>



<li><em>You’ve reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today.</em></li>



<li><em>We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The team also explained that the requirement of the SecureBoot was never going to be a 'silver bullet' to end all cheats:</p>



<p><em>Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do. There are certain signals that we can only trust when Secure Boot is enabled.</em></p>



<p>The fight against cheaters in Battlefield 6 will continue unabated, and the team vowed to give no quarter to hacks and the like, especially when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 10</a>.</p>
