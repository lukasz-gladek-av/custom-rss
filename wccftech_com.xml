			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software aims to improve upon the series' predecessors in all regards, including the endgame portion. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/07/creative-director-discusses-designing-the-very-ambitious-endgame-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Game Informer</a>, Creative Director Graeme Timmins explained:</p>



<p><em>I care about it a lot personally, as my role on Borderlands 3 was curating what became the endgame for that. I know what's important to our community, and that's built already into the game. Like, we made purposeful decisions with our Action Skill tree, assuming what will come in the future with our endgame. It's not a secret that we always eventually do level-cap increases, right? That's built into the high-level design of saying, 'Okay, if that's going to still be in our future, how can we make our Action Skill tree this time anticipate that and be balanced from the jump.</em></p>



<p><em>In Borderlands 3, we ended at 72 skill points. It's a really high number, right? And so, for the game designer in me, that can create a lot of chaos with how those Action Skills were designed. You lose build diversity as you add more skill points because everyone's homogeneous, because they all have the same skills ultimately unlocked. We've thought about Borderlands 4's endgame from the jump, and we have some great plans for it that we're going to share, but I think we're taking a lot of the lessons from both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and Borderlands to make sure that we execute the best version of the endgame yet for Borderlands</em>.</p>



<p>If it succeeds, Borderlands 4 could be a very long lived game, as the endgame is what can really keep players coming to it. We'll see after launch, which isn't far at all, especially after Gearbox brought the launch date forward <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from September 23 to September 12</a>, much to the excitement of fans.</p>
