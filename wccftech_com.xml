			<p>A modded and overclocked Nintendo Switch console can become an excellent emulation machine, so much so that every entry in The Legend of Zelda series can be played on it, including two games whose remasters were long rumored to be in the works.</p>
<p>In a test video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> shows how an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-60-fps/">overclocked system</a> sporting double the RAM of the vanilla system, 8GB instead of 4GB, has no trouble running Wii U games such as The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Wind Waker and a few other titles, including New Super Mario Bros U, and epic Mickey 2. Interestingly enough, the modded and overclocked system also manages to run Zelda Wind Waker at 1440p resolution at an acceptable frame rate. Even more interesting to see is how the modded Nintendo Switch cannot run the Wii U version of Breath of the Wild, as the game freezes shortly after the beginning of the intro.</p>

<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 still continuing to be shrouded in mystery, it is not surprising to see users try to create their own pro version of the original system to make the wait easier to bear. With 2024 almost over, it's almost certain that the first proper look at the new console will only be coming in 2025. The last we heard about the system was earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">this month</a>, with the confirmation that it will be backward compatible with the current system coming straight from Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa.</p>

			<p>Kadokawa Corporation, the owner of FromSoftware, among other game development studios, confirmed the rumors that started circulating <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a> regarding Sony's interest in purchasing the company.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/gematsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, Kadokawa released a new statement today confirming reports that Sony has expressed the intent to acquire the company, but a decision has yet to be made. If there's any update, the statement concludes, an announcement will be made in a timely and appropriate manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">*Update* Kadokawa Corporation has published a statement confirming reports that Sony Group Corporation has expressed the intent to acquire Kadokawa Corporation, but a decision has not yet been made. <a href="https://t.co/8ljzVfJl9Z">https://t.co/8ljzVfJl9Z</a> <a href="https://t.co/LPgn4wFCmN">https://t.co/LPgn4wFCmN</a> <a href="https://t.co/pA1nlN1axx">pic.twitter.com/pA1nlN1axx</a></p>
<p>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1859192371595849753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>FromSoftware owner Kadokawa Corporation is among the oldest Japanese companies still active today. Founded back in 1945, the company has become, over the years, a media conglomerate that operates not only in the video games industry but also publishes manga and anime. Besides owning around 70% of the Dark Souls and Elden Ring developer, Kadokawa also owns Spike Chunsoft and Acquire, which are known for being the developers of the Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi series, which received its latest entry only <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/">last month</a>, and the classic stealth series Tenchu. Acquire has also worked on other successful games in the past few years, such as the two entries in the Octopath series, both developed in collaboration with Square Enix Business Division 11, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-and-luigi-brothership/">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, the latest entry in the Mario &amp; Luigi series released earlier this month.</p>
<p>The latest game released by FromSoftware, which could become a Sony-owned studio if the acquisition of Kadokawa goes through, is the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. You can learn more about it by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

			<p>Square Enix and Tencent's LightSpeed have finally announced the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-reportedly-in-development-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> Final Fantasy XIV Mobile.
