			<p>A little more than four years ago, <strong>John Gibson</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role as CEO and co-founder of <strong>Tripwire Interactive</strong></a> following a controversy sparked by his tweet supportive of the <strong>Texas Heartbeat Act</strong>, which banned abortions in the state after the detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity.</p>



<p>For a while, Gibson, who started as a programmer on the <strong>America's Army</strong> series (developed and published by the <strong>US Army</strong>) and then went on to co-found the studio known mainly for Red Orchestra and Killing Floor, remained out of the games industry. That changed around two years ago, when he started consulting for <strong>Bible X</strong>, the studio behind the Christian-based game project <strong>Gate Zero</strong>. Last month, Gibson, through his recently established publisher <strong>Templar Media</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the developer</a>.</p>



<p>I recently interviewed him to discuss the investment and the game itself, although we started with an explanation of Templar Media's slogan: <strong>"Entertainment First."</strong> Gibson wants to deliver games that focus on the fun factor rather than pushing a political agenda, as he said games (and other media) have been doing lately. </p>



<p><em>I was formerly the co-founder, co-owner, and CEO of Tripwire Interactive. Now, I am leading Templar Media. I founded Templar Media earlier this year.  After selling Tripwire, I took a break, but I realized I wanted to get back into games. <strong>I noticed that in a lot of media, the focus had shifted away from pleasing the player or the viewer. Instead, it was often about whatever commentary or message a developer or entertainer wanted to convey. This is where our slogan, "Entertainment First," originated.</strong> I wanted to establish a company focused on creating great content that people truly enjoy. While everyone aims to make something great, players can tell if your primary focus is not on building an entertaining and fun game. Our goal is to make great, entertaining content.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] <strong>We are catering to an underserved mainstream market. In America and somewhat in Europe, the people creating entertainment often represent a monolithic political block. However, consumers are not a monolithic block and do not necessarily share the same views as those making the entertainment. There is an underrepresented majority that wants entertainment without a specific agenda. </strong></em></p>



<p>Later, the former Tripwire executive referenced <strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong> specifically, where the <strong>Qu'nari</strong> companion <strong>Taash</strong> eventually transitions to non-binary and has a significant discussion with their mother, <strong>Shathann</strong> (an NPC), about it during a personal quest.</p>



<p><em>When I was growing up, movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones or games like Zelda and Metroid were about entertaining you, not an agenda. This has been lost in much of modern entertainment. <strong>For example, in the new Dragon Age game, there is a cutscene where the player is lectured about pronouns. We experience entertainment to forget about day-to-day politics and just have fun. Entertainment needs to go back to focusing on entertaining people.</strong> While our first game is faith-based, we are not afraid to tell those stories to an underserved market and to anyone who simply wants great content without modern agendas. As a company owner and designer, you must focus on what the customer will enjoy, not just your own preferences.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[UK Judge Denies 31 Fired Rockstar Employees Interim Pay, Tribunal Was “Unable to Conclude” Alleged Union-Busting]]></title>

			<p>A UK judge has denied 31 former <strong>Rockstar</strong> employees' bid for interim pay as they and their union representation, the <strong>Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB)</strong>, fight their dismissal and are accusing Rockstar of <strong>union-busting</strong>.</p>



<p>If their interim bid pay had been granted, then Rockstar would have been mandated to put the 31 employees back on the payroll while the legal battle between the employees and Rockstar raged on. The ruling to deny the interim pay bid comes from a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2ODI0NzI2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODUyMDYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFJPOVVLSVVQU1owMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.27VI473B4UvIhmPh6eOoW2Crg7Pem9jtOtoGNX34Bco">Bloomberg</a>, which reports that after a two-day tribunal last week, Judge Frances Eccles felt that the IWGB and the fired workers had not successfully met the bar to demonstrate they had a "<em>pretty good chance of success</em>" at convincing the tribunal of Rockstar's alleged union-busting.</p>



<p>"<em>In all the circumstances, the tribunal was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB</em>," Eccles wrote in their ruling.</p>

Pictured: Jim Munroe, co-founder of Toronto Games Week.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last year, Rockstar fired 34 employees (<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">31 in the UK and three in Canada</a>) at the end of October 2025, with the news breaking and initial union-busting accusations flying at the beginning of November 2025. Rockstar shot back at the accusations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">claiming the workers were fired for leaking confidential information,</a> which Rockstar would later claim included "<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/"><em>specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles</em>."</a></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">The IWGB filed legal claims against Rockstar</a> as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">employees asked for reinstatement</a>, while protests began to appear in physical and digital forms, with game developers both within and outside of Rockstar and Take-Two taking to protesting at Rockstar and Take-Two offices and <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">over 200 Rockstar North employees signing an open letter to management</a> calling for the reinstatement of their colleagues.</p>



<p>An anonymous employee claiming to have knowledge of the situation came forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">claim that Rockstar's accusations are false and that this is a clear case of union-busting on Rockstar's part</a>, and the issue has since been brought to the UK parliament twice, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer speaking on it the second time, calling the accusations "<em>deeply concerning</em>."</a></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-6-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors outside of Rockstar Toronto</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The alleged leaking of confidential information is said to have taken place in <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">a Discord server used by the IWGB and Rockstar employees for the purposes of organizing</a>. Initially, the IWGB claimed that Rockstar was trying to call employees discussing internal Slack policy changes in that Discord server, the 'leak' of confidential information. A claim that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">corroborated by one of the three employees fired from Rockstar Toronto when Wccftech spoke to them, CWA Canada, and other protestors who demonstrated at the Rockstar Toronto offices in December 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Though Rockstar alleges it was more than just the discussion of Slack policies, today's ruling from Eccles does seem to clear up a few unanswered questions about the Discord server in question. Eccles' ruling confirms that the server, which includes 350 members, was, as advertised, used for organizing, but that it also included more than just current Rockstar employees and IWGB staff. </p>



<p>Eccles cites that beyond the three Canadian workers who were not part of the IWGB union, the server did include former Rockstar staff who did not leave the server after having left the company, and it even included one person who Bloomberg describes as someone who "<em>writes articles about the video-game industry</em>."</p>



<p>When Wccftech asked the fired Rockstar Toronto worker about the server, who spoke to us under anonymity, they claimed that if there were people in the server who were no longer at Rockstar, they had "<em>no idea</em>" of their presence, adding, "<em>everyone I've ever spoken to [in that server] was a current employee</em>."</p>



<p>Eccles' ruling also points out that there were other organizing members within the server who were not fired, though, in a point against Rockstar, Judge Eccles also noted that some of the employees who were fired were dismissed despite "<em>having posted very little on the Discord server</em>."</p>



<p>Rockstar, for its part, says, "<em>We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing</em>." Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, the IWGB is "<em>more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar’s calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful.</em>"</p>

			<p><strong>Hytale</strong>, the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">Minecraft-like game that was recently resurrected</a> by its original creator, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, and is now due to be out tomorrow on<a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/"> <strong>January 13, 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> has just hit another milestone in its incredible comeback story, as Collins-Laflamme announces that the development costs for <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> as it builds Hytale in early access have been fully funded for the next two years based on <strong>pre-order sales alone.</strong></p>



<p>The game isn't even out yet in early access, but the community that has built around it since work on the game first started in 2015, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/"> stayed with it after it was acquired by <strong>Riot</strong></a>, only to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">shuttered by Riot and the team disbanded</a>, and then revived within the last few months have shown that they are very excited for Hytale to finally be here.</p>



<p>"<em>Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases</em>," Collins-Laflamme wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). "<em>Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future. Thank you for all the support. <strong>Hytale is saved.</strong> We are almost home.</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The Minecraft-like MMO has been a long time coming, and tomorrow's early access launch not only represents a new chapter for the game and the studio but also an incredible accomplishment for the team to be able to get it out of Riot's hands and across the finish line for release.</p>



<p>Of course, a whole new challenge begins once it is live and in players' hands, but at least the team at Hypixel Studios has the chance to see if they're up for that challenge, instead of the game lying dead in a waste basket of Riot-owned IPs, left wondering if they could have ever made something truly great with Hytale.</p>
