			<p>Today, at Computex 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now available in over 125 games and applications. Following the news, NVIDIA provided more details and trailers about upcoming games and existing PC games that are being updated to include DLSS 4 and other NVIDIA technologies.</p>
<p>Let's start with Portal with RTX, which was upgraded from DLSS 3.5 to the new version while also updating the Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction models to the latest and greatest versions. Additionally, the game now supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Cache</a>. Taking advantage of the neural shader's capabilities to leverage AI to infer a great many rays and bounces from a limited set of indirect lights, the performance is improved even further. The flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, runs Portal with RTX at 277 average frames per second with full ray tracing enabled, according to NVIDIA tests. The RTX 5080 registers 171.5 frames per second, while the RTX 5070Ti achieves 143.7 frames per second.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Saber Interactive will release Roadcraft, a rather unusual game where players will use construction machinery to restore sites damaged by various natural disasters. The game includes DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution (with the transformer AI model), and DLAA on day one. NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation can be enabled via the NVIDIA app overrides and will be added in-game soon. As seen in the trailer, Roadcraft runs at over 250 average frames per second with everything enabled on the RTX 5090.</p>

<p>Two days later, 1047 Games will launch SplitGate 2's Open Beta, which also features integration of the whole DLSS 4 suite: Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p>On the same day, the popular free-to-play melee-focused Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint will receive the <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously announced</a> path tracing update, greatly improving its visuals. The game already supported DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, but this update will also introduce Ray Reconstruction. In the NVIDIA trailer, the game runs at around 350 average frames per second with everything enabled.</p>

<p>In early June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> will be released with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation (which was not yet available in the recent beta), Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex. The NVIDIA trailer shows the game running at over 300 frames per second in some instances.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFzo_o8mH8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>inZOI, the new life simulation game released in early access by KRAFTON, will receive its DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation update in August.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, NVIDIA also demonstrated the Horizon 'clone' Light of Motiram running at over 400 frames per second with Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LIGHT OF MOTIRAM | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgFVQ8BezLg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Crimson Desert will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Reflex, and ray traced effects. Kyungjoon Cho, Head of Game Engine System Division, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Crimson Desert represents a major step forward for Pearl Abyss in intense action and open world design. With NVIDIA's graphics technologies, we're ensuring that players experience and explore the continent of Pywel through high-quality graphics and smooth gameplay.</em></p>
<p>Keita Iida, Vice President of Developer Relations at NVIDIA, added:</p>
<p><em>Pearl Abyss has crafted a visually spectacular and deeply immersive experience with Crimson Desert.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ultra-plus-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-new-ultra-plus-mod-allows-users-to-push-graphics-settings-further-introduces-4k-resolution-cutscenes.1192785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ultra-plus-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available online introduces plenty of visual improvements to the game developed by Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<p>The new Ultra Plus mod, which was developed by Lazorr and can be downloaded from Nexus Mods, introduces plenty of visual improvements by fixing some visual issues as well as visual settings that can be pushed past those available in the vanilla game. Besides the improvements to Global Illumination, Shadows, Reflections, Shading, View Distance, and Texture Quality, the mod also introduces upscaled 4K resolution prerendered cutscenes, which look amazing. Unfortunately, the modder has released no comparison screenshots, though <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM3">some</a> shared by Nexus Mods users <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM4">show</a> how the mod can bring <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM5">considerable</a> visual <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODQw">improvements.</a></p>
<p>Even in its vanilla state, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game that is more than worth experiencing for all fans of the genre. With its unique twists to classic turn-based combat, a beautiful and unique world, a compelling cast, and a moving, thought-provoking story, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is undoubtedly one of the best RPGs of the current generation, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Injustice 3 Teased by MultiVersus Dataminer]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/injustice-3-teased-by-multiversus-dataminer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/injustice-3-teased-by-multiversus-dataminer.1192707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/injustice-3-teased-by-multiversus-dataminer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Injustice 3 might be on the way, as teased by MultiVersus dataminer MultiVerSusie. In a not-too-cryptic X post, they <a href="https://x.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923533288137724173%7Ctwgr%5Ecad582adc9b8e13dcbc918ed0b0eb1a538f4db0b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Finjustice-3-is-rumored-to-be-in-development-1545223%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>multiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice</em></p>
<p><em>leaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice</em></p>
<p>And then, just to make it even clearer:</p>
<p><em>3</em></p>
<p>Of course, it's worth taking this rumor with a big grain of salt. Still, it doesn't seem far-fetched at all. The previous Injustice games were big successes for developer NetherRealm Studios and Warner Bros. Games, selling a lot of copies and garnering widespread critical and fan acclaim. By far their most appreciated feature was the story, which featured a gritty, unique take on the DC Universe where Superman falls into darkness after being tricked by the Joker into killing his beloved Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis. Batman leads the resistance against his totalitarian regime.</p>
<p>There's no question that the Injustice games raised the bar for story and presentation in fighting games, but they were also no slouch in the gameplay department. The second game also added new features like the RPG-inspired Gear System that extended its longevity, particularly in the multiplayer modes. Injustice 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/injustice-2-justified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8.4/10 here on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, Injustice 2 is surprisingly fantastic. Combat feels very weighty and satisfying, the graphics look incredible, characters look fascinatingly detailed and even the bass-heavy sound design is top notch. DC and fighter fans should definitely be giving Injustice 2 time.</em></p>
<p>It's been eight years, though, and fans have only had the mediocre animated 2021 film since. NetherRealm has released two consecutive Mortal Kombat games, so it could well be time to switch back to the DC-branded fighting game, especially since Warner Bros. has mandated a greater emphasis on its DC franchises.</p>
<p>In fact, James Gunn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head of the new interconnected DC Universe</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier this year to have met with both NetherRealm and Rocksteady about new DC games. It might be a while before Injustice 3 is announced, though, based on the DC heads' statements.</p>
