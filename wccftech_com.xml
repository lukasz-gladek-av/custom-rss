			<p>Following the expiration of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard review embargo, lots of media and industry people have started sharing their thoughts on BioWare's latest RPG, including Larian Studios Director of Publishing Michael Douse. In a lengthy tweet <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850949592667590700?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X, Douse showered the game with high praise:</p>
<p><em>I’ve been playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard in complete secrecy (behind my backpack at the office in front of a giant window, in the kitchen). From me, you may be wondering “is this a game compatible with my experience during BG3” so I’ll tackle it from that perspective. </em><em>The answer is yes. It is to a heavy, 9 season long show what a well-made, character driven, binge-worthy Netflix series is.</em></p>
<p><em>It has a good sense of propulsion and forward momentum. The combat system is honestly brilliant (to me, a mix of Xenoblade &amp; Hogwarts which is giga-brain genius). It knows when it needs a tentpole narrative moment, and it knows when to let you toy around with your class and exploit some of its stronger elements. </em><em>More important, to me, it feels like the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be.</em></p>
<p><em>In short, if you want some character driven romping with a strong combat system in a universe you know, love, or have heard of, it is much better than the average action game, and much less heavy than the gargantuan RPGs that may intimidate at times. In a word, it’s fun!</em></p>
<p><em>To me, I’m extremely happy BioWare gets to stick around - presumably - in these uncertain (because of moronic corporate greed) times. An existential game, and a fun one at th</em>at.</p>
<p>As I jokingly replied via tweet, it was not quite <em>complete </em>secrecy. I have known Michael for years and have him on my Steam friends list, so I noticed he was playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard while I was also going through it for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>. Having said that, as you already know if you read my evaluation of the game, I wholeheartedly agree with Douse's assessment of BioWare's latest work. It should definitely appeal to franchise fans but also to those who enjoyed games like Larian's own masterpiece Baldur's Gate 3. It's different, but there are many common threads that will make fans of Western RPGs happy if they give it a chance.</p>
<p>The game is out in two days on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased.1021974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The details of the PS5 Pro enhancement patch coming to Lords of the Fallen have been shared by developer Hexworks. Here's what they shared with fans in the new press release:</p>
<p><em>The PS5 Pro version of Lords of the Fallen allows players to experience the game with a 40% increase in pixel density over the base PlayStation 5 console, resulting in a sharper image and finer details. Performance Mode delivers rich visual detail at 4K60 (upscaled from 1440p) with a fluid 60 frames per second, sharper distant details, and refined textures on characters and environments. For those prioritizing visual fidelity, Quality Mode runs at native 4K30, showcasing intricate visuals across the dual realms of Axiom and Umbral at a stable 30 FPS.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the developers have also teased that further updates and enhancements are planned for the game as a whole, mainly inspired by feedback received from the community. This is a bit of a surprise, as we believed no further patches would be coming for Lords of the Fallen, given that Hexworks is already working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a> scheduled to launch in 2026.</p>
<p>Speaking of Lords of the Fallen 2, Gamereactor has just <a href="http://0.10.211.177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an interview with Hexworks head of art Javier García Lajara, who talked about the first installment as well as the upcoming sequel:</p>
<p><em>In a month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-sold-1-million-units-in-10-days-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a million copies sold, and after that we kept working on several updates and post-launch content for several months. We are around one million and a half more or less. I don't have the final numbers but it should be like that. Unfortunately we haven't had a perfect launch, mainly on PC. The PC market is full of different specs. You can run the game on a pretty beefy machine or you can have a low-end PC, and our game needs to run on both platforms, so we were trying to fix all these problems after launch and we spent several months doing that. I think we managed to do it and the game right now is a completely new experience. I think it's worth it to try again if you had problems on launch.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>For Lords of the Fallen 2, we are not only keeping the dual realm mechanics; we are improving it, and we are leveraging on what we do there. I can't say too much about that. Epic joined the ship to funding the project and we are using of course Unreal Engine 5.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/capcom-sold-over-50-of-h1-fy25-software-on-pc-remains-on-track-to-hit-annual-forecast-despite-first-half-sales-decline/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>More than half of the total CAPCOM software sales for the first half of the current fiscal year have been on PC, according to the publisher's latest financial report.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/explanation/2025/2nd/1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> covering the first half of FY25, the Japanese publisher confirmed that sales, operating income, and Digital Contents segment are all down 25%, 39%, and 35%, respectively, over the previous fiscal year, which is not surprising, considering the publisher launched mostly minor titles in the first six months of the current fiscal year. Still, the publisher confirmed it is still on target to achieve its annual forecast thanks to a second half of the year that will be stronger than the first, thanks to the upcoming launch of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>This fiscal year's sales also highlighted a growing trend for CAPCOM, as of the 20.025 million units of software sold, 54% were sold on PC, with console sales shrinking from 51% in FY20 to 40% in FY25. The publisher's focus on the PC market is definitely paying off, and it will be interesting to see how much Monster Hunter Wilds will sell on PC compared to consoles, which don't seem will deliver the best way to enjoy one of the most anticipated games of 2025, judging from <a href="https://wccftech.com/monstewr-hunter-wilds-display-modes-consoles-120-hz/">impressions</a> from the PS Plus exclusive beta which began today.</p>
