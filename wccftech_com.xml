			<p>Today, San Francisco based independent developer Clockwork Labs announced that their sandbox MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-is-a-community-sandbox-mmorpg-with-a-fully-editable-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcraft Online</a> will launch on June 20 in early access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454650/BitCraft_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>. Moreover, the game's code will be open source, allowing any user to contribute.</p>
<p>Tyler Cloutier, co-founder of Clockwork Labs, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The ethos behind BitCraft Online has always been about one core principle: collaboration. This is a massive in-game ecosystem, where we encourage players to work together to build towns, cities, or even empires. So to truly empower our community, it was important to ensure that the game would be open-source, allowing players to express themselves in their own unique way. We want to give our community not only the toolset to play within our world, but to participate in building it. Open-sourcing is more than just a technical decisionâ€”it's a philosophical one.</em></p>
<p>The game is set in a single procedural world, meaning that all players will play together, unlike in most MMORPGs. They'll join others to form communities, build cities and structures, and discover beautiful biomes.</p>
<p>The world terrain can be modified, too, allowing players to carve mountains and build their own legacy with a tangible impact on the land. As in any good sandbox game, Bitcraft Online promises multiple valid playstyles, from crafter and trader to explorer and monster hunter, or any such combination. Surviving and gathering resources are the keys to success. The economy is entirely player-driven, so the best merchants will thrive.</p>

By the way, Clockwork Labs said it could take several years before Bitcraft Online exits the early access phase, and they are in no rush to do so.</p>
