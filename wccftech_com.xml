			<p>Today, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its Q2 2024 financial report, revealing that the PlayStation 5 had reached 65.5 million units and the quarter had performed well enough to warrant an upgrade to the full-year forecast for the gaming segment.</p>
<p>Following the report, the usual investors call saw PlayStation Co-CEO Hiroki Totoki talking about a couple of hot topics. Speaking of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure of Concord</a>, which led to wasting over $200 million spent on the project and to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure</a> of the developer Firewalk Studios last week, he said (excerpt <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/sony-leads-say-the-company-gained-a-lot-of-experience-from-concords-failure-and-will-have-to-do-more-user-testing-or-internal-evaluation-in-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GamesRadar</a>):</p>
<p><em>Currently, we are still in the process of learning. Basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it. So for us, for our reflection, we probably need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates. And then we need to bring them forward, and we should have done those gates much earlier than we did. Also, we have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development, and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother.</em></p>
<p>Totoki also <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/sony-boss-admits-forcing-pc-gamers-into-playstation-accounts-can-invite-pushback-but-insists-they-have-to-keep-games-safe-which-doesnt-really-track-in-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked </a>about the pushback of PC gamers on Sony's hard requirement to create a PlayStation Network account in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarök</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. The executive admitted that users haven't liked the policy, but he stressed the need to ensure safety in live service games through the PSN account requirement:</p>
<p><em>We have learned a lot. The way to face the issues regarding PC, for instance. The PlayStation accounts that we have offered – well actually, by offering them, for instance, sometimes that tends to invite pushback. But for the live service games, in order to maintain order of the gaming so that anybody can enjoy the games safely, we need to create an environment conducive to that and, of course, enjoying the game freely. </em><em>Having some restrictions, may not call it rule, but to ask the users and gamers to follow the manner, those manners are very important and we have to continue to seek the best way to achieve this.</em></p>
<p>The thing is, neither of those two games are live service titles. They're single player games, and PC gamers rightfully do not understand why they'd have to create a PSN account to play titles that do not even have any online functionality.</p>
