			<p>Additional information on the monsters, quests, and more that Monster Hunter Wilds will feature at launch may have been revealed thanks to the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-struggles-1080p-rtx-4070/">open beta</a> client.</p>
<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1glgv4p/brand_new_datamine_discoveries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TheNadei</a> reported that a friend of theirs took a good look at the beta client's files, discovering information that has yet to be revealed officially, including a list of monsters, the potential total number of quests, and more. <strong>There will be spoilers from here, so do not continue reading if you don't want any surprises spoiled.</strong></p>
<p>According to the information discovered by TheNadei, Monster Hunter Wilds should feature at least 30 monsters, including mainstays like Rathian and Rathalos, and some that haven't appeared in the series in a while, like Blangonga and Lagiacrus, as well as variations of monsters that recently appeared in the series like Anjanath and Odogaron. Additionally, the game should feature at least 164 quests at launch, with number 164 possibly being the final boss quest as it rewards the hunter with a massive amount of points.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds open beta client also features new information on maps, which include 5 normal maps complete with NPCs and a special one, and weather states, which include sand storms, heavy rain, heatwaves, and blizzards. Interestingly enough, the open beta client also features data for breakable parts, which include antennae and trunks, suggesting that a Neopteron or Carapaceon monster could be in the game alongside an elephant-like monster like Gammoth.</p>
<p>As all of this information was discovered in the beta client, there's a good chance it is incomplete, and Monster Hunter Wilds will feature more monsters or other surprises when it launches in a few months. Still, it definitely looks like hunters will have plenty to do already at release.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th worldwide.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro brings considerable visual and performance improvements in several titles, including Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 remake, Demon's Souls, and others.</p>
<p>In the tests conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel/videos">Brazil Pixel</a>, the latest two entries in the CAPCOM survival horror series powered by the RE Engine show considerable performance improvements. Resident Evil Village, for example, runs at locked 120 frames per second in HFR without ray tracing at 1080p resolution, which is quite impressive to see on a console in a relatively recent game. The Resident Evil 4 remake, on the other hand, doesn't reach the same locked 120 FPS frame rate but does run close to 100 FPS in Frame Rate Mode without ray tracing, which is still quite impressive.</p>

<p><iframe title="Resident Evil 4 - PS5 PRO - High Frame Rate - Patch 1.400.0 - Performance - FPS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NgVzXqZJ0Tk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>In a Tekken 8 quick test, Brazil Pixel also showed how the raw power of the PlayStation 5 Pro can boost games that use dynamic resolution even without a dedicated patch. Unfortunately, not every game can take full advantage of the console's power, such as Rise of the Ronin, which still suffers from performance issues even on the new system.</p>

<p>Among the games that were updated to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's power and features is also the Demon's Souls remake by Bluepoint Games. The recently released PS5 Pro patch introduces material-displaced contact shadows for all dynamic lights and 4K, 60 FPS support via PSSR upscaling, which makes one of the best-looking PS5 games to date look even better. These improvements can be seen in action in the comparison video below, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, BioWare <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/4453590197273100466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> patch after the game's launch on October 31. The patch, around 1GB in size, is largely focused on a variety of bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where DLSS options could end up “grayed-out” on a 40-series Nvidia GPU.</li>
<li>Eliminated the cause of a small number of crashes.</li>
<li>Updated XeSS version to 1.3.1.</li>

<li>Harding now has arrows in her quiver and is ready for battle.</li>
<li>Global banter should no longer start too early.</li>
<li>Harding and Taash banter no longer repeats indefinitely.</li>

<li>Updated a number of assets to improve visual performance over long distances.</li>
<li>Fixed several distance “pop-ins” on level art assets.</li>
<li>Added collision to several assets that were missing it.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor texture issue with codex art.</li>
<li>Added haptics to a number of interactions and events.</li>
<li>Fixed lip sync in some ambient scenes.</li>
<li>Adjusted audio balance on several Dragon Age: The Veilguard assets.</li>
<li>Changing equipment no longer disables helmet voice processing.</li>
<li>Fixed several objective markers that were spawning improperly.</li>
<li>Cleaned up certain interactions between Skills that caused them to not behave as described.</li>
<li>Apparitions generated by Iron Veil will now attack</li>
<li>Entropic Spheres now behave properly on vertical surfaces.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Taunt would sometimes be cleared early, which caused enemies to ignore it.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where Rogues would not hold their bow while aiming down sights.</li>
<li>Made the detailed-stats screen more readable.</li>
<li>Balance changes made to certain fights to match design intent.</li>
<li>Balance adjustments made to several player skills.</li>
<li>Fixed leashing exploits on major encounters.</li>
<li>The Rage Demon’s Ring of Fire should now be appropriately dodgeable in all situations.</li>
<li>Slowed down the speedy raven in Hossberg.</li>
<li>Adjusted creepy corpse movement while they moved on/off-camera.</li>
<li>The Dalish elf in the Unwanted Guests quest is now an actual elf.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare blocking issue in the Sea of Blood quest.</li>
<li>Halla should no longer float during the In Entropy’s Grasp quest.</li>
<li>Fixed a blocking issue in the Pinnacle of Its Kind quest.</li>
<li>Adjusted timing on epilogue text cards.</li>
<li>NPC necks no longer grow unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Corrected instances where Dragon Age: The Veilguard NPCs would not properly look at each other or at Rook.</li>
<li>Long hair should now properly mesh with certain armor.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with makeup in character creation.</li>
<li>Venatori crystal VFX should now disappear properly.</li>
<li>Added scroll wheel support to the sell screen.</li>
<li>Opening the journal while on the map no longer causes it to continue scrolling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, BioWare also added a Mass Effect themed cosmetic armor to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is entirely appropriate since the patch dropped on N7 Day. You'll find the armor in a new chest near the Caretaker's Workshop in the Lighthouse, on the condition that you have completed Harding's mission called The Singing Blade.&nbsp;That wasn't the only news Mass Effect fans got yesterday, by the way: there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV series in development at Amazon Prime Video.</a></p>
<p>As for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the game peaked on Steam at 89.4K concurrent users last weekend. We'll see if it can top that this coming weekend.</p>
