			<p>According to insider Tom Henderson, Assassin's Creed Invictus could launch in 2025. The leaker <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1906783248232923469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a> a question on X about the upcoming spin-off game, saying that Ubisoft should release it this year.</p>
<p>The publisher only acknowledged its existence with a brief sentence <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/RQdGp9fytJeMffReMQpN3/fc14fdc4ed35de3550e1c94e250893a9/Ubisoft_FY23_H1_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2022's financial report</a> that followed the 15th anniversary of the franchise and its updated roadmap:</p>
<p><em>Additionally, a team, including For Honor veterans, is currently working on bringing back multiplayer to Assassin’s Creed with a standalone experience through Infinity under the project codename Invictus.</em></p>
<p>The only information we have on Assassin's Creed Invictus comes from leaks via <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xJ0nathan</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-invictus-will-be-a-fall-guys-like-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>. Both confirmed that it's a multiplayer game with an arcade feel inspired by Fall Guys and Smash Bros. Players would compete in multiple rounds across various multiplayer modes, such as team deathmatch, free-for-all, and some sort of speedrunning competition. There are also reportedly powers that characters can use to get a boost. The camera is said to be further away from the player character, while maps and characters from previous games like Ezio and Cesare Borgia will make an appearance in Assassin's Creed Invictus.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it'll be an unusual experience, and it remains to be seen whether it'll be successful. Still, 2025 kicked off on the right note for Ubisoft with the strong launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> more than three million units in the first week, the second-best debut in the whole franchise after Valhalla (though that game launched during the pandemic and therefore had its sales boosted by the contingency).</p>
<p>There could be even more Assassin's Creed coming relatively soon, with the remake of the beloved fourth chapter (Black Flag) <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be targeting a 2026 release. It was actually originally scheduled for November 2025, but that was before the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows. There was also a rumor about the latter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a co-op multiplayer mode post-launch</a>, by the way. There won't be any shortage of adventures in the franchise, that's for sure, especially following the creation of a new subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solely dedicated to the expansion of Ubisoft's biggest franchises</a> (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six).</p>

			<p>A Sonic Adventure 2 Unreal Engine 5 remake is in the works, and a new playable demo is now available for download to allow users to experience for themselves the stunning recreation of some classic stages.</p>
<p>The demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/SA2R/939490">here</a>, features the modern recreation of Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Green Forest, among other levels and boss fight updates. The demo, much like the yet-to-be-released full remake, is powered by the Azure Framework, a branch of Velocity+ that overhauls the physics, camera, controls, and UI to offer a brand-new experience that still sports some classic mechanics, such as a high-speed platforming experience and the return of the scoring system which rewards players to chain moves together to keep a perfect score and score more points. Visuals have also been significantly improved over the original, featuring real-time path-traced lighting and reflections.</p>

<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog PC fans have definitely been eating well. Besides the recent release of the Sonic Adventure 2 Redux Unreal Engine 5 remake demo, some dedicated developers have released an unofficial port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-unleashed-unofficial-pc-port-download/">Sonic Unleashed</a>, finally giving PC players the chance to try out the console-exclusive game like never before. Hopefully, the follow-up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/">Sonic Frontiers</a>, which has yet to be officially announced, will receive the same amount of love from Sonic Team as these fan projects have from their developers.</p>
