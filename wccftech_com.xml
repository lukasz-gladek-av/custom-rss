			<p>Lords of the Fallen developer HEXWORKS continues improving the game at a rather impressive rate. After November's big <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.6 update</a> that introduced enhanced exploration of the Umbral realm, balance changes, and PlayStation 5 Pro support (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-runs-max-pc-settings-in-lords-of-the-fallen-says-dev-a-comparable-pc-would-be-more-costly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further detailed in our exclusive interview</a>), the Spanish team has already released a new major update to improve the fluidity of combat thanks to more accurate animation cancellation, improved invincibility frames, more intuitive dodges and rolls, serious attack button prompts, general stamina balancing, and more.</p>
<p>These latest enhancements are meant to make players feel more in control when playing Lords of the Fallen, especially in combat. In the vision of the developer, they also help lower the entry barrier for new players while raising the skill ceiling for more experienced players. Version 1.7 also includes several quality-of-life updates, such as the ability to toggle automatic Vigor collection (first added in November's v1.6 update), more realistic enemy attack ranges and tracking for more immersive encounters, and further balancing the New Game Plus experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, newcomers will now get the ability to summon NPCs to assist in boss battles before the first encounter (previously, this could only be done after the first defeat). HEXWORKS has tweaked their stats to make them more viable allies in combat. Version 1.7 also sees the addition of a fan-favorite character, the Hallowed Sentinel Hound (also known as 'Good Boy'), as a new summonable NPC for boss encounters.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't get a high score on Wccftech</a> at launch, but it has since been massively revamped with several updates like this one. There's already a sequel on the way for 2026 that <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promises</a> gameplay improvement, better production values, and more upgrades. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> it will be an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC, following a major investment by Epic Games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can get Lords of the Fallen for 60% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The offer is only valid for a limited time.</p>

			<p>Fortnite OG has now launched as a separate game type for players to enjoy, and it comes with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">own game pass</a> as well, allowing players to get rewards that they can utilize in Fortnite OG. Within just 20 minutes of the game's release, it managed to get over<a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 1.1 million concurrent players</a>, with this statistic including the OG Zero Build game. This a huge deal for Fortnite, especially after they broke their record for most concurrent users just days before, with 14 million players playing Fortnite on November 30 for the Remix Finale event. Many gamers believe that Battle Royals, including Fortnite, aren't as popular as they used to be. However, Fortnite has seen some groundbreaking statistics for the genre, and the game saw 30 million active users a day during the entirety of 2024.</p>
<p>Fortnite first launched in 2017 and helped the Battle Royale genre skyrocket to new levels of popularity. This game was initially seen as an alternative to PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, which was also launched that year. Compared to PUBG, Fortnite was entirely free-to-play, with the option to purchase cosmetic items such as skins and bling.</p>
<p>While there are many different reasons why Fortnite continues to remain popular today, a lot of it comes from the massive names they've seen collaborate with the game. The game has seen live events and concerts, such as those of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and even Ariana Grande. While these types of events do sound somewhat like a fever dream, they always have a massive turnaround and bring new players to the game.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Fortnite Remix Finale event took place on November 30, where performers such as Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Ice Spice participated. Snoop Dogg even provided a performance of "Another Part of Me (feat. Sting)" for the event. Admittedly, numbers did drop significantly after the event finished, but Fortnite continues to be incredibly popular, even after seven years of being active.</p>
<p>A lot of the popular events in the game revolve around the OG content, with a lot of the events being temporary maps that players can enjoy for a limited time. However, December 6 saw Fortnite OG be added to the game as a separate game type, now providing players with even more choices as to what experience they play in Fortnite.</p>
<p>Players who want to participate in Fortnite OG will get the choice between the original experience, which includes loot, locations, and features from the original experience. Alternatively, they can play OG Zero Build mode, which means players don't have to farm materials and build structures to survive.</p>
