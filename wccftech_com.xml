            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a post-mortem Ghost of Yotei interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Sucker Punch Studio Head and Co-Founder Brian Fleming suggested that the Bellevue-based developer will keep focusing on one game project at a time instead of attempting to juggle more than one.</p>



<p><em>The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time. If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.</em></p>



<p><em>So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. </em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Fleming also hinted that Sucker Punch has to deal with internal pressures from employees as well as external pressure from fans when it comes to potentially diversifying its output.</p>



<p><em>At 30 years, we now have employees who are kids of former employees. We have employees who weren’t born when the studio was founded. And you also have had enough changes from Sly, to InFamous, to Ghost that part of those changes, when they happen, is that it means not just you’re walking away from Tsushima, and not just that you’re walking away from the actors in Tsushima, but you’re walking away from employees who’ve been a part of the studio for the last decade, because they don’t want to do a game set in a historical setting.</em></p>



<p>As much as I'd love a new Infamous game, though, the Ghost of franchise has simply gotten too big. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the excellent Ghost of Yotei</a>, which seems to be selling almost as quickly as its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on initial estimates</a>, Sucker Punch owner Sony has also invested on a live action film that is being directed by Chad Stahelski and an anime based on the multiplayer mode, Legends. Chances are the developers will be put on Ghost-making duty for at least one more installment.</p>



<p>In related news, we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently published an interview with actor Feodor Chin</a> about his role as the main villain of Ghost of Yotei, Lord Saito.</p>

			<p>The additional content of the War of the Lions release may at very least have been considered for Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles at some point, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>Using a Cheat Engine table to alter in-game values, YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GusPagan">Gus Pagan</a> discovered that the remaster of the classic tactical role-playing game released last month on PC and consoles features hidden in its files evidence that the War of the Lions content, or at least part of it, may have been considered. This includes the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs and the extra characters Balthier and Luso.</p>



<p>As the implementation of these extra Jobs and characters is clearly incomplete, however, they could simply be leftover data that was carried over from the War of the Lions version code. Still, this could definitely bode well even if the extra content isn't officially released for the remaster, as modders could use this data to port the content themselves, <a href="https://ffhacktics.com/smf/index.php?topic=12951.0">something that has already happened for the original PSX version of the game.</a></p>

<p>While having the exclusive War of the Lions content would make Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles the true definitive edition of the tactical role-playing game, in no way does the remaster need it to be an excellent game. Check out my review to learn <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">how choice improvements like voice acting and a tweaked user interface enhance an already excellent game.</a> </p>

			<p>ZeniMax Online has released the Battle for the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online on all platforms, a novelty in itself given that updates usually launch on PC and Mac before consoles. The Battle for the Writhing Wall is a key component of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-developer-qa-theres-tons-of-exciting-stuff-we-havent-talked-about-thats-coming-to-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a> because so far, players have been limited to exploring Western Solstice due to this magical barrier (made of souls) erected by the dreadful cult of necromancers. Now, though, the whole community of the MMORPG will participate in an assault on the barrier that will develop over three stages.  </p>



<p>The first phase is one of supply and defense where players must help the Stirk Fellowship (a partnership between the three Alliances and the Fighters and Mages guilds) gather resources for the upcoming battle. Both sides engage in skirmishes over siege camps, and planar incursions will affect locations across all of Tamriel. All The Elder Scrolls Online players can contribute to progressing this phase, but only those who have purchased the 2025 Content Pass can accept quests in Solstice. During this initial stage, you can expect the Worm Cult to take over various delves and public dungeons throughout Tamriel, using them as invasion sites and marking them on the map. These areas have additional monsters that are more difficult to defeat than usual and are the focus of the daily quests offered by the NPC Orinde Glenuvon.</p>



<p>In Phase 2, players must strengthen the war effort and maintain siege camp defense while the proper assault on the Writhing Wall begins. Expect vicious counterattacks as the Fellowship prepares its decisive strike against the wall. As before, all players may contribute, but only 2025 Content Pass owners can accept quests in Solstice. Siege Camp incursions will occur more frequently and be more difficult to complete. Additionally, the Daedra Ghishzor, a powerful Maldrith, will appear as a world boss on Solstice.</p>



<p>Finally, the last phase will start with the Writhing Wall exposed. At that point, it will be time to break through and clear the Writhing Fortress public instance. Unlike the other phases, which vary in length depending on player successes and mobilization, the third phase lasts one week from when the Writhing Fortress is first completed on a given server; the event ends after that period. Only players with the 2025 Content Pass can attempt and complete this phase.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Similar to the vanilla World of Warcraft event of the opening of Ahn'Qiraj, each server will progress separately depending on its players' contributions. The Xbox Europe and PlayStation Europe servers are currently slightly ahead of the others. The progress of each server can be followed <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/writhingwall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via this official The Elder Scrolls Online website page</a>.</p>



<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-qa-zos-leadership-change-game-alive-30-years-unfortunate-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed the ZeniMax Online leadership</a> to discuss the studio's changes (the layoffs, the cancellation of Project Blackbird, and the new Game Director, Nick Giacomini) and their goal to keep Elder Scrolls Online alive for 30 years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Square Enix Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGVWVq8cJPI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was at last week's Brasil Game Show 2025</a> to discuss Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 and the trilogy as a whole. Speaking about the decision to split the original game into three parts, he explained:</p>



<p><em>Final Fantasy VII is a game with a truly huge fanbase. We could have cut some parts and turned it into one game, but the fans of the original would never have forgiven us. If we want to tell this story using new technology, it's not possible to do so in a single title. That's why we made the difficult decision to split it into three parts.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview on stage, Hamaguchi expressed confidence that the ending of the final chapter of the trilogy would satisfy both new and old fans:</p>



<p><em>Of course, I already have a clear idea of ​​the ending for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3. I think this conclusion will appeal to both those who loved the original and those who became fans of FF7 thanks to the Remake series. I'm confident this new game will be loved by everyone.</em></p>



<p>Nearly a year ago, Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 would need some twist to make it a unique and exciting experience compared to the previous two. We still don't know what that will be, but we recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did get confirmation from Tetsuya Nomura</a> (another director on the series) that the game (and Kingdom Hearts IV, too) is on schedule.</p>



<p>Looking at the four-year timespan between Final Fantasy VII Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, we might have to wait another two to three years before the conclusion to the remake trilogy is out. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous games are launching on Xbox Series S|X and Nintendo Switch 2</a>, starting with the first chapter.</p>
