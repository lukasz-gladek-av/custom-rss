			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monolith Productions' official closure</a>, renowned journalist Jason Schreier shared more details about what the studio had been working on since the 2017 launch of Middle-earth: Shadow of War.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, Schreier revealed that Monolith did not want to make another game in the 'Middle-earth: Shadow of' universe. That is understandable, as by Shadow of War, the formula had become rather stale. The developer attempted to create an original IP codenamed Legacy next, but Warner Bros. Games decided to cancel the project in April 2021. This proved to be a fatal blow for Monolith because most of the leadership team resigned and went on to found <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cliffhanger Games</a>, an Electronic Arts-owned developer that is developing <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Black Panther game</a>. Interestingly, this new game will feature 'new storytelling tech' that will be used across several EA games, sounding a lot like the Nemesis system developed at Monolith. That one is trademarked by Warner Bros. Games, but some of the former developers could have developed a similar concept without incurring legal problems.</p>
<p>Anyway, Monolith tried to make the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman game</a> powered by the Nemesis system. However, the studio had to rebuild its leadership team from scratch in the middle of this new project, and they were also unsure whether to use Unreal Engine or their own LithTech Firebird engine. The latter ultimately won out, but several of the engineers who were experienced with it had left the company by then, causing development problems.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Wonder Woman was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-game-was-rebooted-last-year-rocksteady-is-going-back-to-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> between late 2023 and early 2024. The new version was supposed to be more like God of War and no longer have the Nemesis system. Clearly, though, a lot of work was left to do before the game could ship, and Warner Bros. Games decided to cut their losses and shut down Monolith for good. As is often the case in these situations, the developers only learned about the dire news on the same day as the public.</p>
<p>Regarding the rest of Warner Bros. Games, some executives reportedly wanted to transform WB Games Montreal into a support studio after the release of Gotham Knights, and some of the team was put on helping Monolith with Wonder Woman until recently. However, the developer of Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights is still trying to pitch a Game of Thrones title, and the IP based on George R.R. Martin's world was named among the publisher's priorities going forward. According to Schreier, TT Games is also in the final steps of making a new LEGO game that could launch as early as next year.</p>

			<p>Striking Distance, the studio behind The Callisto Protocol, has unfortunately been struck with more layoffs, as confirmed by parent company Krafton. The information began surfacing online earlier today, with former Director of Concept Art Jesse Lee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a post</a> on Linkedin, saying "most of the devs were laid off."</p>
<p>It was then confirmed later in the day by Krafton, where they gave a statement to PC Gamer about what had happened. Krafton has declined to put a number on the amount of layoffs that had been made but said that they were done to keep the team "agile."</p>
<p>"<em>Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile, which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development. The studio remains operational, and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time,"&nbsp;</em>said a representative.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the first round of layoffs that Striking Distance has experienced. Layoffs took place in August 2023, where 32 people lost their jobs. The Callisto Protocol was a mixed bag out of the gate, with a lot of people having <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-pc-experience-is-an-unacceptable-stutterfest/">issues with stuttering</a>, especially on PC. The game had some pretty high-end demands. However, the game was a significantly smoother experience on a console. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">Kai Tatsumoto reviewed the game</a> two years ago and gave it a 7.2.</p>
<p>With the failure of The Callisto Protocol, <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/">Glen Schofield</a> left Striking Distance in September 2023, which was just over a month after layoffs took place.</p>
<p>Striking Distance then made a top-down shooter after The Callisto Protocol, but that game also failed, with an all-time peak concurrent player count on Steam of 169. Considering how much money went into developing The Callisto Protocol, with the game costing over $<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-reportedly-cost-over-160-million-to-make/">160 million</a> to make and then not performing as well as they had hoped, this was devastating news for the company.</p>
<p>There is now news that the company is reportedly working on a new title that is being developed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-working-on-a-brand-new-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-title/">Unreal Engine 5</a>. Lead Gameplay Programmer of Striking Distance has on his LinkedIn profile that he is "leading a team of 12 gameplay engineers" to make this upcoming title.</p>
<p>So far, this year has already seen a devastating amount of layoffs across a number of companies, both big and small. Most recently, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/"> entire Marvel Rivals team</a> was laid off, as well as a significant number of staff at <a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-scales-back-team-focusing-on-lost-skies-development/">Bossa Games</a>.</p>
