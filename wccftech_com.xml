			<p>Despite being a very niche genre, fighting games haven't been in a better position, but looking at the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/">games released this year</a></strong>, this wouldn't seem to be the case. <span>With the latest entries in iconic series like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/" target="_blank"><strong>Street Fighter</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank"><strong>Tekken,</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/" target="_blank"><strong>Guilty Gear</strong></a>&nbsp;continuing to receive support with new content and balance changes, there's obviously no reason for CAPCOM, Bandai Namco, and Arc System Works to launch new games.</span></p>



<p>Still, the few fighting games that launched in 2025 are all quality games. Whether you are looking to experience a brand new game or return to a beloved classic, these games have something good to offer you.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category:<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>Action</strong></a></em></p>



<h2 id="h-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fatal-Fury-City-of-the-Wolves.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Despite being absent from the spotlight for a very long time, SNK's Fatal Fury series continued to be extremely popular among fighting game fans. After a long wait, the series returned this year with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, and it couldn't have done so in a better way.</p>



<p>Besides featuring the unique two-plane combat mechanics of past entries, City of the Wolves ups the heat with the new mechanics, such as the Rev mechanics that can enhance special attacks, open up combo possibilities, and more. </p>



<p>With a wealth of single-player modes, including the RPG-like mode Episodes of South Town, a character roster featuring both beloved returning characters and newcomers (including some familiar faces from Street Fighter), Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is rightly considered by many to be the best fighting game released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-2xko">2XKO</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2XKO_KeyArt_YasuoDarius_Final-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Riot's Project L has been a known entity for a long time, but it's only this year that the fighting game community has been able to go hands-on with the project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/"><strong>now known as 2XKO.</strong></a></p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/">Having only launched on PC in an early access version late this year,</a></span> it's still too early to know if Riot's immense expertise in multiplayer games will be able to make a dent in the popularity of games like Street Fighter 6. Still, it's undeniable that, leveraging the iconic League of Legends cast, the developer is creating a compelling tag-fighter that is easy to get into thanks to simplified execution of special moves, and harder to master with its deep assist system and interwoven offensive and defensive mechanics.</p>



<p>With 2XKO launching next year on consoles, 2026 could definitely be the year for Riot's fighting game. However, even in its current state, the game is more than worthy of anyone's time.</p>



<h2 id="h-absolum">Absolum</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Absolum.png"></a></figure>



<p>Although traditional competitive games are the face of the fighting game genre nowadays, the resurgence of the side-scrolling beat 'em up subgenre continues at full speed, providing some excellent games, such as Absolum.</p>



<p>Developed by Supamonks and Guard Crush Game, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/streets-of-rage-4-beautiful-brawl/"><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></a>, Absolum blends the same combo-oriented gameplay of the SEGA series revival with roguelike mechanics and procedurally generated levels, creating a remarkably satisfying experience with tons of replayability and an immense amount of depth thanks to the masterful crafting of each character's moveset.</p>



<p>While the game may be a little lacking in content right now (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673?l=english"><strong>though more is coming next year</strong></a>), Absolum brings a new spin on a classic formula that works exceptionally well, making it one of the best fighting games released this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-world-stage">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Virtua-Fighter-5-REVO-World-Stage.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With fighting games being in a better place than in past console generations, it was baffling to see how SEGA was neglecting the Virtua Fighter series, one of the first franchises to guide the genre's transition from 2D to 3D. Thankfully, the Japanese publisher eventually came to its senses, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/"><strong>a new entry in the series is in the works by the Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</strong></a></p>



<p>To bring back the franchise to a new generation of players ahead of the launch of the new game, SEGA <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-revo-world-stage-october-5-debut/"><strong>launched Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</strong></a>, an updated version of the latest entry in the series, complete with a single-player mode incorporating all the gameplay mechanics and tweaks introduced to the base game over the years.</p>



<p>Though not the new entry in the series fans expected, Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage is a more than decent release to tide them over for the launch of a new generation game that promises to be the peak of the series.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CAPCOM-Fighting-Collection-2.avif"></a></figure>



<p>Considering the current state of the genre, supporting more than a single fighting game is a real challenge for even big publishers like CAPCOM, which has been exclusively focusing on Street Fighter 6 since its launch in 2023.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the Japanese publisher hasn't completely forgotten about some of its older IPs, such as Capcom vs. SNK and Rival Schools, releasing them to the modern audience with the Capcom Fighting Collection 2.</p>



<p>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein, Power Stone and its sequel, the two Capcom vs. SNK games, Project Justice, Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, and Capcom Fighting Evolution, the Japanese publisher has made it easier than ever to enjoy these classic games, hopefully with the intent of eventually reviving one of these series with new entries.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>
