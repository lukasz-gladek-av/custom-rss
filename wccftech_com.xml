			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> versions of <strong>Dispatch</strong>, the popular narrative-driven superhero adventure game from former <strong>Telltale</strong> developers at <strong>AdHoc Studio</strong>, are out, but they don't provide the exact same experience you get on other platforms with Dispatch, as the select moments of nudity included in the story and curse words said by the characters are <strong>censored</strong> on the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 versions.</p>



<p>Before it was officially confirmed, we knew Dispatch would be arriving on Nintendo's hybrid consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/">from an Australian Nintendo eShop listing</a>, but it was not clear then, or when it was officially announced, that the game would be arriving with some changes. We only learned about the censorship when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dispatch-out-nintendo-switch-2-but-nintendo-censored-it/">game arrived on the consoles yesterday</a>, at which point AdHoc Studio was the only party to comment on the changes.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually</em>," AdHoc Studio began in a press release. "<em>We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.</em>"</p>



<p>Today, Nintendo issued its own statement, shared first with <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">GoNintendo</a>, in which the company doesn't really explain the what or why this happened, but does claim that it "<em><strong>does not make changes to partner content</strong></em>." You can read the full statement below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations</em>."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Part of Dispatch's whole pitch is that it is a more mature superhero story, with AdHoc renewing and revitalizing the narrative and gameplay formulas that worked so well with the initial run of popular Telltale titles. Censoring the nudity doesn't really impact the experience, but it's easy to imagine that the curse words getting censored would impact a player's experience, since more than half of the lines in some scenes would be loud bleep tones.</p>



<p>Players have also taken umbrage with Dispatch seemingly being singled out. It's not the first game to appear on Nintendo's platform to include swearing and nudity. If you can play <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a> without these issues, why not Dispatch?</p>



<p>Dispatch was one of 2025's standout titles, with <strong>Breaking Bad</strong> actor <strong>Aaron Paul</strong> voicing the game's <strong>Iron Man-like</strong> lead, <strong>Robert Robertson</strong>. It's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">nominated for several industry awards</a> and was also voted <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/">Wccftech's Best Adventure Game in 2025</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/"> by both the Wccftech Gaming team and our community.</a> It also closed out 2025 with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studio-dispatch-over-3-million-copies-sold/">over 3 million copies sold</a></strong>.</p>



<p>At this point, it's unclear if we'll ever know the actual reason, but looking at Nintendo's statement, the reason could likely lie with the individual ratings boards that Dispatch would have to be submitted to across the globe to release the Switch and Switch 2 versions. As noted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-comments-on-dispatchs-nintendo-switch-2-censorship/">VGC</a>, the version of Cyberpunk 2077 you can buy in Japan includes no nudity or extreme gore, including decapitations.</p>



<p>If AdHoc were to release a completely separate version of Dispatch for sale in regions like Japan, then we may see the current censorship removed for other versions of the game. The issue with that, however, is that AdHoc Studio is a smaller indie team that doesn't have the resources of a studio like CD Projekt RED. The version we have now may just be the compromise AdHoc was forced to go with, because it lacked the financial wiggle room to work on and submit a completely separate version for select regions.</p>



<p>Again, it's not likely we'll ever learn the real reason, but Nintendo has at least tried to say that players upset with the censorship should not point their finger at them.</p>

			<p>The <strong>PlayStation Portal</strong> is among the <strong>most interesting gaming systems</strong> Sony has released in a long time. After abandoning the handheld market following the unlucky <strong>PlayStation Vita</strong>, Sony somewhat made its return to the space with the system, which originally launched as a <strong>Remote Play-focused device.</strong> </p>



<p>Since its release in 2023, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-new-update-performance-connectivity/">console's functionality</a></strong> has been expanded <span>to include&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/it-it/support/subscriptions/psportal-cloud-game-streaming/">cloud gaming</a></strong>, effectively turning it into a sort of portable PlayStation 5 that</span> can run games well under the right conditions.</p>



<p>Despite not running games natively, the PlayStation Portal has proven <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">quite popular</strong> among gamers. The system is considered so <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">successful</strong> that Sony is reportedly working on <span>an<strong>&nbsp;updated</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> model</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/intels-panther-lake-igpu-is-really-worth-considering-for-a-handheld-amd-fell-asleep-at-the-wheel.1692741/post-271210464"><strong>NeoGAF forums</strong></a>, known insider Kepler L2, who correctly revealed plenty of information about both Sony and Microsoft gaming systems in the past, said the system has been so successful that "<em>they're even doing another version this year."</em></p>



<p>When asked what the new version of the PlayStation Portal system will feature over the current model, the insider replied, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"OLED.</em>" Given the system's current functionality, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">a new display is the most obvious upgrade</strong> and could make the system more enticing to those who didn't buy the current model.</p>



<p>Regardless of the specific improvements the rumored upgraded PlayStation Portal will offer, the community seems <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">enthusiastic about the possibility</strong>. "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">It's definitely a low-key success and a good idea for this moment when component prices are so high</strong>," said <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qqxlml/comment/o2k3ngg/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Reddit user NotTakenGreatName</strong></a>. Amidst the current<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> price increases</strong> and their negative outlook for the immediate future, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a low-cost system</strong> capable of running <strong>a sizeable portion of the current PlayStation library in some capacity</strong> would definitely be quite enticing.</p>



<p>However, a simple upgrade to an OLED display may not be enough for some. While some, like user <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sakaixx</strong>, would love to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a 120Hz OLED display</strong> to take advantage of the 40 FPS modes in many PlayStation 5 games, others would like to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">other upgrades</strong>, such as better Wi-Fi and a longer-lasting battery, so the success of a new model with limited upgrades is far from being guaranteed.</p>



<p>Although not comparable to proper gaming systems like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Portable </strong>and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Vita</strong> due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-issues-bitrate-limitations/"><strong>its limitations</strong></a>, the low-key success of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Portal could bode well for the rumored <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">PlayStation handheld</a>, </strong>which is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">s</strong>aid will launch alongside the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 6</strong>.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/"><strong>next-generation home console could be delayed beyond the 2027- 2028 release window</strong></a>, it remains to be seen if plans won't change regarding the handheld's release, and if the unexpected PlayStation Portal success could push Sony to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">launch the handheld system ahead of the home console</strong> to offer another gateway into the PlayStation ecosystem at a more reasonable price.</p>

			<p><strong>MindsEye </strong>developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong> has <strong>ended its publishing deal</strong> with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-devleoper-confirms-new-game-is-coming-007-only-external-ip-studio-would-work-on/">Hitman</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-need-to-empty-your-wallet-for-more-ram-007-first-light-updated-system-requirements-lower-ram-and-vram-recomendations/">007: First Light</a></strong> developer <strong>IO Interactive</strong>, according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/">Insider-Gaming</a>. MindsEye was the first game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/">IO Interactive published under its new publishing label</a>, and it might just be its last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">if reports from <strong>last year</strong></a>, and now this, are to be believed. </p>



<p>That said, according to the report, the decision to end the deal came from Build a Rocket Boy's side, not IO Interactive. This is said to come from Build a Rocket Boy wanting to start publishing its games internally and ultimately have more control over its future. This also reportedly means that the previously planned MindsEye and Hitman collaboration has been cancelled.</p>



<p>Now that 2025 is in the books, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has more GOTY awards than any other game before it</a>, if you were wondering what's at the opposite end of the spectrum, that would be MindsEye, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/2025/metascore/?page=19">at least according to Metacritic</a>. Only earning a <strong>37</strong>, it was the <strong>worst-reviewed game of 2025</strong>, after it had a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">disastrous launch</a></strong>.</p>



<p>To say it was an extremely bug-plagued game at launch would be an understatement. It was bad enough that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation gave players refunds</a></strong> because the game was so broken. And when it was working, critics and players hammered the lack of anything to do and its less-than-enticing story.</p>



<p>It was a bad situation for Build a Rocket Boy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">The game didn't have the worst sales launch,</a> all things considered, but the word-of-mouth and the barrage of memes and clips of the game's worst moments killed any momentum the team at Build a Rocket Boy could have had. The studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">suffered layoffs</a>,</strong> and developers called out the studio leadership, which included former <strong>Rockstar</strong> producer <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">damning open letter</a>.</p>



<p>An even more <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">damning report from the BBC a week later</a> revealed more about the internal issues at Build a Rocket Boy, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">while the studio has tried to update and fix the game</a>, it feels more likely that it will run out of financial runway and get shut down before it has a chance to see its full vision for MindsEye realized.</p>



<p>Considering all of this, it's interesting that the report indicates the decision to cut ties came from Build a Rocket Boy's side, and not IO Interactive. Maybe this is because Build a Rocket Boy has a comeback plan it wants full autonomy over. We'll see if that's the case, though it's worth noting that so far, neither Build a Rocket Boy or IO Interactive have officially confirmed or denied this report.</p>
