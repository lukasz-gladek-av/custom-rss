			<p>This coming <strong>Thursday, February 12, 2026</strong>, is when <strong>Sony</strong> and <strong>PlayStation</strong> will host the first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong> event of 2026. It is set to air at <strong>2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT,</strong> and we now know that it's not the only showcase event of the evening. <strong>Konami</strong> has revealed that it will host a <strong>Silent Hill Transmission </strong>event that same night, featuring news about what's next for the Silent Hill franchise, including <strong>Silent Hill: Townfall.</strong> And it'll kick off approximately an hour after the State of Play ends.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a short post on the official Silent Hill social channels, with SH: Townfall being the only game directly called out. Outside of that, the event will include "<em>the latest updates from the Silent Hill series</em>," and it'll premiere at <strong>4pm PT / 7pm ET</strong> on Thursday, and at <strong>12am BT</strong> on <strong>Friday, February 13.</strong></p>

<p>We don't yet have a release date for SH: Townfall, and neither Konami nor <strong>Annapurna Interactive</strong>, which is developing SH: Townfall alongside Konami, have shared a release window. What we do have, however, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">a <strong>March 26, 2026,</strong> date from a retail listing</a> that popped up in November 2025. It could be the release date, but it could also have been just a placeholder. At the end of the day, we know that SH: Townfall has been in development for a number of years, even making it through a <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-is-still-in-development-despite-annapurna-interactives-woes/">massive shake-up at Annapurna</a>. A March 2026 release date doesn't feel like the most far-fetched idea. </p>



<p>We also have confirmation from Konami that it wants to keep up the pace of releasing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-aiming-to-release-new-silent-hill-game-each-year-to-keep-buzz-constant/">new game in the Silent Hill franchise every year</a>. A strategy that the company hopes to maintain after putting out <strong>Bloober Team's</strong> remake of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Silent Hill 2</a></strong> in 2024 and last year's wonderful new entry to the series, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">Silent Hill f</a></strong>, both of which saw strong commercial success.</p>



<p>Besides SH: Townfall, this could be the showcase where we finally get to see what Bloober Team has been working on with regard to remaking the first Silent Hill game. With that reportedly set to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-2027-launch/">arrive in 2027</a></strong>, it may just be early enough for us to get our first tease of the remake, though it's just as likely that we won't see it until a bigger showcase later on in the year.</p>



<p>What's also interesting to consider with this event, specifically due to the timing of it following the State of Play, is that we could get a trailer for SH: Townfall during the State of Play, only for Konami to follow it up with a deep-dive into the gameplay during the Transmission event.</p>



<p>Between the State of Play, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">DICE Awards</a></strong>, and now this, it's clear that Thursday, February 12, 2026, will feel like a busy night in the video game industry.</p>
