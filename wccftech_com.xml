			<p>Nintendo has reconfirmed that Metroid Prime 4 is still slated to launch before the end of the year. They also revealed that it will be playable alongside other Nintendo Switch 2 games (Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition, Hades II, Borderlands 4, and Elden Ring Tarnished Edition) during <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fan Expo Canada</a> in Toronto, Ontario. The expo runs from Thursday, August 21, to Sunday, August 24, essentially at the same time as Gamescom, at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.</p>



<p>It's definitely great news for all those gamers who have been waiting eight long years for Metroid Prime 4, ever since it was announced in June 2017. Its troubled history is well-known: Nintendo had initially handed development to Bandai Namco, only to change their mind and bring it back to historic developer Retro Studios. That inevitably affected the release timeline.</p>



<p>Between Nintendo's confirmation and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-rated-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent listing on the South Korean rating board</a> (the GRAC), there's good reason to believe Metroid Prime 4 won't be delayed again. If that's the case, a release date announcement could be forthcoming. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, our Nathan Birch was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go hands-on with the game</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event: </p>



<p><em>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond demo on offer at the Nintendo Switch 2 event was relatively brief, essentially consisting of the game’s intro and its first boss battle. The demo opens with Samus touching down in the middle of a pitched battle between the Federation Force and those pesky Space Pirates on the remote planet of Tenmaar. For this section of the game, the usual lonely tone of Metroid games is cast aside in favor of lots of action and general activity, as a larger conflict unfolds all around you.</em></p>



<p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</em></p>

			<p>At EVO 2025, SEGA shared a brief new look at the upcoming New Virtua Fighter Project. The trailer shows off some combat gameplay set in the training stage. It's only about a minute, but it does look promising, featuring smooth animations and meaty punches and kicks.</p>



<p>The New Virtua Fighter Project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-game-is-in-development-sega-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> for the first time by SEGA in November 2024, though the actual <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a> came about a month later, during The Game Awards 2024, when we learned that the game was being crafted by Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</p>



<p>The game was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-pre-development-video-shows-impressive-visuals-and-animations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstrated</a> with a 'pre-development video' shared at CES 2025 during NVIDIA's keynote. Later in January, Virtua Fighter fans were able to enjoy the <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-available-on-steam-new-launch-trailer-released/">release</a> of VF5 R.E.V.O. on Steam, with all major consoles (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2) now <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-is-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-and-nintendo-switch-2-with-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to be getting the game with full cross-play enabled. That should tide them over until the new title is available, which could be in a few years' time.</p>

<p>While the new Virtua Fighter project was arguably the most interesting news to come out from EVO 2025, there were others. Bandai Namco said that Tekken 8 is getting a new DLC character, Armor King, on October 13 for Season 2 Character Pass owners and on October 16 for all users. Additionally, a new fighter named Miary Zo from Madagascar will be released as DLC this winter, along with a new stage called Baobab Horizon.</p>

<p>The upcoming fighting game Invincible VS, in development at Quarter Up, has been confirmed to feature Omni-Man as a playable character. To be honest, it would have been weirder if he was not available, since he's such a pivotal character of the IP. Invincible VS is targeting a 2026 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Finally, Arc System Works announced that a PlayStation 5 closed beta test for <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> will take place between September 5 and 7, with registration now open <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on PlayStation.com</a>. The closed beta test will feature six playable characters, online matches, a spectator mode, and a training tutorial.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned AMD leaker KeplerL2 has revealed in a series of posts on the NeoGaf board (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mgijwx/keplerl2_xbox_xs_hardware_has_sold_less_than_30/?share_id=Ch1EvdKxiKZjo7CR5NGHO&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Reddit</a>) that the Xbox Series S and X consoles have sold less than 30 million units, according to his estimates based on AMD sales data.</p>



<p><em>They aren't even at 30 million. You don't need third party trackers, you can use AMD's number and Sony's number to figure out Xbox sales. Steam Deck is part of SCBU and counted as a console; Van Gogh and all its variants were developed by SCBU (Semi-Custom Business Unit) and fall under the same reporting as the consoles. Z1/Z2 are repurposed laptop chips (Rembrandt/Phoenix/Strix) and fall under the Client segment.</em></p>



<p><em>It is also important to note that AMD's number is higher than what Sony/Xbox would count as unit sales since it includes chips sold but still in-flight (i.e., being assembled somewhere).<br>So Q3 &lt;100 million console units with ~66 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck would put Xbox Series S and X at a maximum of 29 million. Q4 &gt;100 million console units with ~75 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck means Xbox sold a minimum of 21 million units. So, Xbox sales for this gen range from a minimum of 21 million + Q1/Q2 2025 unit sales to a maximum of 29 million + Q4 2024 + Q1/Q2 2025.</em></p>



<p>This means Sony's PlayStation 5 could have around three times the install base of Microsoft's Xbox duo. The choice to create a lower priced model, the Series S, was not nearly enough to stop the constantly dwindling sales. Even in the last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">otherwise profitable quarter</a>, Xbox hardware sales decreased 22% on a year-over-year basis.</p>



<p>At least the Xbox Series S and X are not sold at a loss anymore, according to KeplerL2, unlike Sony's PlayStation 5:</p>



<p><em>PS5 had a brief period of being even/profitable, but then component prices went up (N7 wafers, GDDR6, and a few others), and it went right back to losing money. As far as I know, the regular PS5 is still sold at a minor loss; only the PS5 Pro is profitable. They did a die shrink for the Series X and raised prices; it should be profitable now.</em></p>
