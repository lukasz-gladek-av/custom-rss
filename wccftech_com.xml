			<p>After two of the games included in December 2025's list of PS Plus Extra and Premium games <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-on-connait-les-tetes-daffiche-des-ajouts-de-decembre-2025-60803">joining the game catalog leaked early</a>, PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-assassins-creed-mirage-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-skate-story-and-more/">now officially confirmed</a> all ten of the games coming to PlayStation Plus for subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>



<p>There are three big headlining titles for the month, one of them being a day-one release that is actually already available for Extra and Premium subscribers. That game is, of course, Sam Eng's Skate Story, which puts you in the Vans of a demon made of glass and pain who must skate through Hell to try and eat the Moon. It's a fever dream of a story if there ever was one, and it's one of the more exciting indies to end off 2025.</p>



<p>The other two big headlining games are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, which were also the two games that leaked courtesy of Dealabs. As for the rest of the games joining the catalog, other notable titles include <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/granblue-fantasy-relink-exceeding-expectations/">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a>, Lego Horizon Adventures (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-five-games-december-2025-lego-horizon-adventures-neon-white/">which is also one of the PS Plus Essential games for the month</a>), and Planet Coaster 2.</p>

<p>PS Plus Premium subscribers only get one addition to the Classic's Game Catalog for the month of December, but at least it's a game that has no trouble standing out on its own, as Soulcaliber III is now available for Premium subscribers.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for December 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Skate Story (PS5)</li>



<li>Granblue Fantasy: ReLink (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Planet Coaster 2 (PS5)</li>



<li>Cat Quest III (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Lego Horizon Adventures (PS5)</li>



<li>Paw Patrol: Grand Prix (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Paw Patrol World (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Soulcaliber III (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PlayStation Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable inclusion for what PS Plus subscribers are getting in December 2025 is a credit for the Sony Pictures Core store. The number of credits you receive will depend on which tier you are subscribed to, though PlayStation does not make it clear how many credits PS Plus Extra and Premium members get, or if PS Plus Essential subscribers get any credits at all.</p>



<p>The promotion also claims to only come as part of a purchase for a 12-month PS Plus subscription (any tier), though it doesn't clarify if this offer is available to those already subscribed to an annual plan. The promotion is active from December 11, 2025, to January 12, 2026, so perhaps more information will become clear once it's live. Hopefully, the offer is available to all subscribers, regardless of when they purchased their subscription.</p>
