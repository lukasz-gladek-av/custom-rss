            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been over half a year since we had any update from developer <strong>inXile</strong> on their next game, the steampunk RPG <strong>Clockwork Revolution</strong>. Following a new trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-clockwork-revolution-trailer-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-will-launch-on-pc-and-consoles-in-due-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown at the 2025 <strong>Xbox Game Showcase</strong></a> in June, inXile founder and CEO <strong>Brian Fargo</strong> had claimed the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would feature 'truly evil' options for players and multi-person dialogues</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Fargo has been featured <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clockwork-revolution-could-be-the-most-expressive-xbox-rpg-in-years-with-inxile-aiming-to-bring-the-level-of-reactivity-from-our-isometric-titles-into-something-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a new interview published by GamesRadar</a> in which he described Clockwork Revolution as <strong>the studio's most ambitious game</strong> 'probably by a factor of 10', on account of them trying to translate the level of interactivity usually seen in isometric games into a first-person action RPG.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Fargo once again stressed the importance of building truly alternative options for players to choose, even if that means creating more content that can be seen in a single playthrough.</p>



<p><em>For me, roleplaying means I can play a role and actually affect the world around me. If all paths lead to the same outcome, the immersion breaks, and you start to feel like you're just playing a game rather than living in one. But when the world is constantly reacting and reflecting your choices, both in big ways and just as importantly in small ways, that's when immersion really sets in.</em></p>



<p><em>We probably build roughly 30% more content than what any player could see in a single playthrough. We want players to be able to approach the game as a different archetype, whether you want to be good, evil, or something in between. Here's what's really important to us: if you don't allow the player to be bad, to really go down those rabbit holes and see the consequences play out, then they never had free will to be good in the first place. They're not choosing to be good, they're just being forced down a path. We think it's essential that players are making that choice, not having it made for them. We also have a very dark sense of humor, which makes all of it even more fun.</em></p>



<p>Clockwork Revolution <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first showcased during the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The game doesn't have a release date, so unless Microsoft and inXile are secretly planning a late 2026 launch, we're probably going to have to wait until 2027 to play it. As a reminder, inXile's previous game, <strong>Wasteland 3</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in August 2020</a>. </p>



<p>The game is currently announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>, although given Microsoft's multiplatform policy, it's only a matter of time before it eventually lands on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, too.</p>

			<p>In September 2025, insider <strong>Nate the Hate</strong> (who just won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award as voted by Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors) <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-rumored-launch-2026-xbox-series-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the rumor</a> that <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong>, the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, would launch this year on Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X and Nintendo Switch 2. It seems <strong>Square Enix</strong>'s plan in this regard hasn't changed, at least according to the insider, who <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013735117735313739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed it on X</a> in response to a follower's question.</p>



<p>If true, it would mean that Xbox and Nintendo gamers are getting both released games in the trilogy in the same year. The first one, <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong>, is launching today on both platforms. Last month, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a free demo</a> that stunned gamers particularly for its great visuals and performance on the Nintendo Switch 2, which <strong>almost looked on par with the PlayStation 5 version</strong>. The developer had previously also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-actually-solid-spec-wise-ffvii-remake-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken well of the Xbox Series S</a>, saying they had no problem porting FFVII Remake Integrade to the platform, except for a few memory-related challenges. </p>



<p><strong>Porting Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will undoubtedly be more challenging</strong>, though, especially for the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2. The more recent game has a far larger scope and open world-like environments that will be quite taxing on the CPU, unlike the first game's fairly linear maps. Because of this, a 2026 launch would be all the more impressive, provided it is decently optimized. For comparison, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-playable-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is playable on the Steam Deck</a>, but only with some major performance and graphics caveats.</p>



<p>Series aficionados are also waiting with bated breath for news about <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. Last month, director <strong>Naoki Hamauguchi</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it was almost time for its unveiling, and fans thought it would happen at The Game Awards 2025, but it didn't. That said, it could be shown at the next State of Play, whenever that will be. As with previous games, the game will likely launch on Sony's PlayStation 5 first.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BF Labs Players Will Get First Crack at Testing Battlefield 6’s New Season 2 Map and a BF4 Map That’s Being “Rebuilt for Today’s Battlefield”]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After an <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/"><strong>extremely strong launch</strong> that carried it</a> to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">one of the <strong>best-selling games of 2025</strong></a>, <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> could not have gotten off to a worse start to 2026 than by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/">delaying the arrival of Season 2.</a></strong> If you can't wait for the entire extra month it'll now take to arrive, then the clear answer is to do everything you can to get into <strong>Battlefield Labs</strong>, as <strong>EA</strong> announced that players participating in BF Labs will get to test out Season 2's new map, <strong>Contaminated</strong>, and everyone's favourite mini helicopter, <strong>Little Bird</strong>.</p>



<p>Those are just two of the main additions coming in Season 2 that BF Labs players will get their hands on first, as EA and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> continue to test and tweak things for the upcoming season. In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond">a blog post on the game's official website,</a> the BF Studios team outlined that the new map falls somewhere between the size of <strong>Eastwood</strong> and <strong>Mirak Valley</strong>. To give you a potentially better idea of how big it is, the team adds that it's "<em>comparable</em>" to maps like <strong>St. Quentin Scar</strong> from <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> or <strong>Arras</strong> from <strong>Battlefield V</strong>.</p>



<p>Contaminated and Little Bird are all that BF Labs players will be testing in the next session EA hosts, but the BF Studios team is quick to point out it'll be doing a lot more testing, and that future tests will be "<em>more exploratory</em>," including testing out different aircraft and vehicle systems. There are also adjustments to RPGs and vehicle interactions incoming, to potentially re-tune how vehicles can respond to RPGs and TOW launchers, and how those weapons impact vehicles.</p>



<p>There are other changes not outlined in the blog post that EA and BF Studios say will arrive in time for Season 2, and there are even more changes that won't arrive until after Season 2. Including the return of a <strong>Battlefield 4</strong> map that EA and BF Studios call a "<em>fan-favorite</em>" map: <strong>Golmud Railway</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today’s Battlefield, not simply ported forward," </em>the blog post reads.<em> "Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems. Golmud is planned to be the largest Battlefield 6 map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project. Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Lastly, EA and BF Studios did bring up the popular topic of a <strong>Solo Queue</strong> for its battle royale mode, <strong>REDSEC</strong>. While there's no indication that it'll be testing Solos in REDSEC anytime soon, the team is still testing it internally to help the team understand "<em>where Solo play can best fit within the broader battle royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other battle royale experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>These tests are part of our ongoing effort to make informed decisions about how Battle Royale is structured and presented over time, rather than committing to a single permanent configuration. Any future player-facing testing would be approached with the goal of learning and validation, and we’ll share more details ahead of time if and when those tests are planned.</em>"</p>



<p>Upsetting as it is that we'll have to wait longer than expected for the arrival of Season 2, it's at least good to know what EA and the BF Studios teams are looking to test in the meantime. Now that we're more than a few months into Battlefield 6 being in players' hands, it's also interesting and encouraging to see BF Studios lean on BF Labs like this, so that players get the chance to try out what's coming to the game, and provide feedback that could, realistically, help EA avoid a season so collectively hated that it kills any momentum the game had.</p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> is a new third-person extraction shooter from <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, the same team that brought you the fast-paced FPS <strong>The Finals</strong>. ARC Raiders was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">intended to be Embark's debut game</a> before the team decided <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">to rework it entirely</a> and focus on The Finals first, a bet that seemingly paid off now that ARC Raiders is <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">one of the most popular games on the market today since it arrived in October 2025</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-gameplay-overview">Gameplay Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ARC Raiders will be familiar to extraction shooter fans, while still accessible for those new to the genre.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you've played an extraction shooter before, the core concepts of ARC Raiders will be familiar to you. You jump into a large, expansive map, scavenge for resources and materials, raid and take down enemy players, and extract back to Speranza, the underground city you and every other raider call home.</p>



<p>Beyond enemy players, you'll also have to be wary of ARCs, the hostile machines that are the cause of the dystopian nature of the world. There are several different kinds of ARCs, and you can find out more about them below in the 'Know Your ARCs' section.</p>



<p>You can also find out more about ARCs and the gameplay in ARC Raiders in our upcoming Tips and Tricks, First 5 Things to Do, and Most Annoying ARCs - And How to Deal With Them guides.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-started">Getting Started</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll hit the character creation screen after you complete the tutorial.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you first log into ARC Raiders, you'll go through a short tutorial that shows you a couple of gameplay basics, like how to move, shoot, breach doors, and search for resources. It's all very basic and seems to end very abruptly with one major lesson: you have to be aware of other Raiders. You learn this lesson when two unknown Raiders catch you by surprise, though, unlike in a regular match, because this is just the tutorial, you wake up after the screen fades to black and fades back in, and the tutorial continues.</p>



<p>From there, you continue until you reach an exit elevator and make your first trip to Speranza, the underground city that becomes your home. You'll be given what looks like a storage closet as your place to live, which you'll slowly build out into your ultimate post-apocalyptic home, and meet the first of the vendors you'll get quests and buy resources from.</p>

<h2 id="h-building-your-raider">Building Your Raider</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Upgrading your stats and your gear is key to buildcrafting in ARC Raiders.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Creating the aesthetic of your character is, of course, a key part of the experience in any game. But what's really going to impact you in gameplay is your stats and what you take with you when you go up top. </p>



<p>You don't want to take anything with you that you would really regret losing, and you can't just keep rolling the dice with free loadouts. You need to figure out how to put a build together, particularly with where you put your early stats and what weapons you put stock in. </p>

<h2 id="h-speranza-overview">Speranza Overview</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You've got to know how to navigate Speranza.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speranza is your home base of operations in ARC Raiders. It's where you look at and upgrade your Raider's stats, change your loadout, your outfit - it's where you do everything.</p>



<p>You cycle through the main lobby screen, your Workshop, your Raider, the Traders, Decks, and the in-game Store with the left and right bumpers. Your inventory, however, is always available on its own dedicated button. If you don't know what that button is, look to the bottom left of your screen.</p>



<p>When you're in your inventory menu, make sure to pay attention to the '<strong>Actions'</strong> button. That's where you'll be able to decide on what to do with everything you find and store in your <strong>Stash</strong>. You also need to pay close attention to a small '<strong>Expand</strong>' option that sits just above your inventory stack. That's where you upgrade your Stash, so it can hold more things.</p>

<h2 id="h-going-topside-and-coming-home">Going Topside and Coming Home</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Overview-Hub-5-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Going up is only half the job, you have to come home safely too.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, you can't upgrade your Raider, your gear, build out your home in Speranza; you can't do anything, if you can't survive a raid. Once you choose where to go, when you arrive you'll have approximately 30 minutes to grab what you can and make it back to an elevator to reach Speranza safely.</p>



<p>Each map will have multiple options for elevators or other ways back home, but they won't all be open to you for the whole match. One will remain available the entire time, but if you want the safest route home, you'll need to make it to an elevator in time.</p>

<p>You should always be on the lookout for other players. Even with the reputation ARC Raiders has gained where plenty of players choose to play a more passive, PvE style, they're technically always a danger. But ARCs, the robots that stalk every inch of the map, those are the biggest danger of all.</p>



<p>That's why it's important to know your enemy; not just how to defeat it, but how to avoid it, and how to ensure you're always making it back home.</p>
