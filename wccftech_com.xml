			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">Metal Eden</a> is an upcoming single-player FPS game from developer Reikon Games and publisher Deep Silver. It will launch on May 6, 2025, and today, a free demo was released so players can try the game for themselves.</p>
<p>Players will be able to check out the opening two missions of the sci-fi shooter "<em>for an unlimited period from today</em>," the studio wrote in a press release. So, even after the game is out, you'll be able to give it a try before buying and jumping into the full game. The demo is available on all platforms the game will release on, so you can head to your PC, PS5 or Xbox Series X/S to install the demo now.</p>
<p>A brand-new trailer for the game was also released alongside the new demo, which shows off how the game evokes shooters like Titanfall with its movement system and futuristic weapons arsenal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hades 2 Will Be A Nintendo Switch And Switch 2 Console Exclusive At Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch.1158687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even though it's been in early access for almost a year now, at time of writing, the full release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-second-update-tweaks-major-core-combat-mechanics/">Hades 2</a>, set to arrive sometime later this year, is easily one of the most anticipated releases for 2025.</p>
<p>However, just like the launch of the original Hades, players on Xbox and PlayStation consoles will have to wait to play the full release. During a Creator's Voice video from Nintendo published on Tuesday, Supergiant Games confirmed that Hades 2 will be a Nintendo console-exclusive game at launch.</p>
<p>That means when it arrives at the still unannounced release date, it'll be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. If you don't have any of those devices and only play on a PlayStation or Xbox console, you'll have to wait a little longer to check out the full release of Hades 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hades 2 was one of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">third-party games confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 direct last week, though it was not confirmed to be one of the launch titles for the console, as we're still without a release date for the full game.</p>
<p>It arrived on PC in early access on May 6, 2024, and at the time of writing, that one-year anniversary is less than a month away. It wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we didn't have to wait too much longer to hear more about when the 1.0 version of Hades 2 is ready to release.</p>
<p>The original Hades spent almost two years in early access, and while it's entirely plausible the same could happen here, all signs point to Hades 2 being ready for its full launch far ahead of that timeline.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is the first sequel Supergiant Games has ever done, with each of its previous projects being one-and-done titles that have all added to its mythical status as an indie developer that simply does not miss. Early access players are already loving Hades 2 and can't wait for the full release. It is almost surely a lock for one of the games that'll be a part of 2025's Game of the Year conversation.</p>

			<p>Almost immediately after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct had players excited about the new device and the new games revealed, a dark cloud took shape above that excitement with Donald Trump's announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">steep tariffs</a> imposed on countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the time since, there's been plenty of speculation as to how these tariffs will impact the cost of the console<span>. Nintendo even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed pre-orders for the console in the United States</a> from the original April 9, 2025 date&nbsp;</span>to "<em>assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.</em>"</p>
<p>That delay will now also impact Canada, as Nintendo confirmed to Canadian publication <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/">MobileSyrup</a> that pre-orders for the console have been delayed in Canada "<em>in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the U.S.,</em>" the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>"<em>Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date,</em>" the statement continued. "<em>The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged</em>."</p>
<p>It's unfortunate news for Canadians who thought they might've avoided the delay that their southern neighbors are dealing with, especially considering that they are only hearing it a day before pre-orders were meant to go live.</p>
<p>The fate of Canadian gamers' Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order hopes is now tied to that of United States gamers, whether they like it or not. In this case, it's safe to assume not.</p>

			<p>The PvPvE extraction RPG game from Wolcen Studio, currently known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">Project Pantheon</a>, just got a new teaser trailer revealed along with the announcement that Wolcen Studio is hosting a second closed alpha test that interested players can now sign up for.</p>
<p>The test will only last for a little less than a day, beginning on <strong>Friday, April 25, 2025 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT</strong> and ending the next day on&nbsp;<strong>Saturday, April 26 at 2:59pm PT / 5:59pm ET / 10:59pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Those interested in joining the closed alpha to get an early taste of Project Pantheon can <a href="https://pantheon.firstlook.gg/">sign up for the play test at this link</a>.</p>
<p>If you already participated in the first closed-alpha test for Project Pantheon, you don't have to worry about signing up for this new one. You'll automatically be granted access to it. For everyone else, all you need to do is make sure to register your interest in the play test before <strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>There's a number of new features that play testers will be able to check out, including the player sanctuary now being a "<em>fully 3D navigable hub where players can customize gear, track achievements, and craft runes</em>," the studio says in a press release.</p>
<p>There's also a new dodge roll mechanic, new weapon and gear customizations, new weapons like a new magic weapon simply called "<em>The Staff</em>," new dungeons, a new monster faction to fight in t<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">he Hamförir, and a structured gameplay tutorial to help newcomers get the hang of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Of course, there's also a slew of bug fixes<span>&nbsp;and new quality-of-life improvements. For example, a revamped health and shield system, abilities adjusted to feel&nbsp;<em>"snappier,</em>" according to Wolcen Studio, and the overall movement system </span>improved.</p>
<p>If you miss out on this closed alpha, Wolcen Studio currently has two more planned for Project Pantheon after this. The third closed alpha test will arrive sometime in summer 2025, with the fourth coming a bit later in the year in autumn.</p>
