			<p>Disney apparently wants more adaptations of the highly popular Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, as revealed by the Windows Central's Jez Corden in the newest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD58iKzc55c">Xbox Two podcast</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have done enough to impress Disney, so the studio now wants to develop more titles based on the IP. MachineGames, the developer behind the adaption, has done a great job mimicking the original Indiana Jones movies with Great Circle, which has been reflected in the title's popularity over the internet as well. Jez Corden says, "Disney picked up the phone and wants more Indiana Jones," implying that there are more adventures for the gaming incarnation of Indiana on the way.</p>
<p>The main reason Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have seen such a massive success, at least in terms of how the title turned out, is that MachineGames has a lot of experience with first-person view titles, notably the Wolfenstein series. This is why they have nailed the game in transitioning into various scenarios. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-bundles-indiana-jones-the-great-circle-with-geforce-rtx-40-gpus-full-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-support/">support for DLSS 3.5 and full path tracing</a>, the visuals are absolutely exceptional with this title.</p>

<p>Not only this, but the title has excelled at replicating the lore of the original movie character, which has resulted in nothing but positive feedback for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">extensive review</a> of the title categorized it as "the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton," which seems to be the consensus among critics and fans alike.</p>
<p>While information around the future of the Indiana Jones series is uncertain, we can be optimistic about the franchise's development now that Disney is interested in getting a proper gaming franchise going. For now, the developers' main focus will be on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 port</a>, which is scheduled to launch next Spring, and the announced story DLC, The Order of Giants.</p>
<p>By the way, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has just been named the "Game of the Year" at the Gamescom tournament. It received 55% of the votes and dominated other big titles released in 2024, like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
