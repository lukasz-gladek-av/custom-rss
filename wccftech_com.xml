			<p>A few years ago, NetEase Games helped fund several game development studios based in Western countries and Japan. Over the last year, though, many of those were abruptly shut down in the middle of developing those projects that NetEase had expressed interest in the first place.</p>



<p>This includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Untold</a> (spearheaded by a Mass Effect writer, who was working with his team on a sci-fi action/adventure game), <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-devs-defect-found-jar-of-sparks-new-studio-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jar of Sparks</a> (founded by former Halo Infinite developers), <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ouka Studios</a> (the only one to actually release their game, Visions of Mana, before being shut down), and more recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T-Minus Zero Entertainment and Fantastic Pixel Castle</a>. The former studio has received an unexpected second wind thanks to a few veterans and directors who decided to invest in retaining the name; the latter now has an expiration date of November 17, although founder Greg Street is still trying to secure funding until the last possible moment. </p>



<p>NetEase must have mandated that November 17 date, as it's the same expiration date that another developer, the Montréal-based Bad Brain Game Studios, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communicated a few hours ago in a LinkedIn post</a>. Sean Crooks, Studio Head and former Ubisoft developer on Watch Dogs games, is still trying to shop around the game they were working on, The Midnight Riders:</p>



<p><em>As we close this chapter, the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</em></p>



<p>To help showcase their work, they shared a sizzle reel, which makes it look a lot like a proper Stranger Things game. Indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-brain-game-studios-qa-building-an-open-world-spielberg-ft-king-coming-of-age-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we interviewed Sean Crooks in June 2023</a>, he shared his vision for a 'Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King in an open world with a coming-of-age story'. The game was also clearly set in the 1980s.</p>

<p>There are other studios whose fate is currently uncertain, such as Jackalyptic Games, which is working <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a Warhammer-based massively multiplayer online game</a>. Unfortunately, there has been no official update, only rumors that Jack Emmert and his team are also looking for another publisher. Even a high-profile hire such as Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has only been given enough resources to finish his game, and according to reports, NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't even want to pay for its marketing anymore</a>.</p>
