			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could feature a 120 Hz screen with VRR and HDR support, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jfrb32/the_switch_2_is_rumored_to_have_a_120hz_lcd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, Famiiboards forum member Secretboy, who correctly revealed the GPU performance of the system before clock speeds were leaked back in January, recently reiterated that the console will feature a 120 Hz screen that will support both variable refresh rate and high-dynamic range. The user also said that it will be an LCD screen, and not a superior OLED screen, most likely to keep costs down.</p>
<p>Expecting Nintendo Switch 2 games to run at 120 FPS is obviously a bit unrealistic, but a 120 Hz screen with VRR support comes with some additional benefits, such as games supporting 40 FPS modes and better responsiveness, that would greatly improve the gaming experience on the system. However, while the user did reveal information on the system correctly in the past, they haven't provided any evidence for their claim, so we have to take what has been revealed today with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't take much longer to learn if the Nintendo Switch 2 will indeed sport a high refresh rate screen. The proper unveiling of the system will take place less than two weeks from today during a Nintendo Direct airing on April 2nd. Among the games that will likely be shown during the event, which will supposedly also confirm <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">when the system will launch</a>, is said to be Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The next entry in the series will blow everything else shown during the event out of the water, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-updated-patent-ai-upscaling-metroid-prime-4/">rumors.</a></p>
