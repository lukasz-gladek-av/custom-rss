			<p>To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Metro series, developer 4A Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-2033-legacy-an-upcoming-expansion-mod-shown-in-first-trailer/">Metro 2033 Redux</a> will be&nbsp;free for the next 48 hours on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a>, and Xbox.</p>
<p>A short clip of gameplay from Metro 2033 Redux announces the giveaway with a post on the series' official X account. The post showcases the definitive version of the first installment of the series, which launched back in 2010. Redux, the version that is free for players to grab, was released four years later, in 2014.</p>
<p>It's unclear why PlayStation players are left out of the loop or if they'll be included in a future giveaway. For now, though, you're better off running to one or all of the aforementioned digital storefronts to add a free copy of Metro 2033 Redux to your library.</p>
<p>The Metro series celebrated its actual 15-year anniversary on March 16, 2025, and at the time announced that there would be "<em>events, deals, and celebratory content</em>" posted throughout the year. In addition to getting Metro 2033 Redux for free, you can also get the rest of the series on sale on Steam and GOG. Though&nbsp;Metro 2033 Redux isn't available for free on PlayStation, it is heavily discounted, along with the other games in the series.</p>

<p>Metro 2033 Redux will take you back to the series' origins, but so will the most recent game in the Metro series, last year's prequel VR title <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/">Metro: Awakening</a>. But no new mainline entry has pushed the story forward in years.</p>
<p>Regarding what's next for the franchise, formally 4A Games Ukraine, now Reburn studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/4a-games-confirm-theyre-making-the-next-metro-with-dmitry-glukhovsky/">confirmed</a> that they are working on a new Metro game with the series creator Dmitry Glukhovsky. Still, there's been no news on this new title in some months. It'll be a while longer before we get any new word on how the title is progressing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, grab Metro 2033 Redux for free while you can, especially if you missed it being free on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-and-metro-2033-redux-now-free-on-the-epic-games-store/">Epic Game Store</a> a few years ago.</p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle on PlayStation 5 Pro features Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and other improvements over other console versions while running at a consistent native 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> takes a good look at the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game developed by MachineGames, providing additional information on both. On base PlayStation 5, the game runs in its single display mode with dynamic resolution scaling ranging between 1800p and 1620p, with drops to 1440p. On PlayStation 5 Pro, on the other hand, the game is generally displayed at native 4K resolution, as confirmed<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-runs-native-4k-playstation-5-pro/"> last week</a>. The PS5 Pro version also features improvements to Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and Contact Shadows, although the improvements aren't huge. In addition, both versions of the game are extremely well optimized, as were the Xbox Series X and S versions, maintaining consistent 60 FPS with ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>It's good news that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks and runs well on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, as it is a game worth experiencing.

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle later this week, on April 17th, on PlayStation 5. The game is also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-has-10-year-plan-for-diablo-iv/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo IV</a> was released in 2023, it was the first new mainline entry in the series in more than a decade, and according to the Diablo series general manager Rod Fergusson, we'll be playing Diablo IV for just as long before we can start to expect Diablo V.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/chain-interview-marc-merrill-rod-fergusson-shuhei-yoshida-more">Game File</a>, Fergusson said that Blizzard is with Diablo IV "<em>for the long haul" and that the studio's plans for the game span</em> the next decade. So, don't expect to hear anything about Diablo V until approximately 2033.</p>
<p>"<em>We're here for the long haul,</em>" Fergusson said. "<em>We've been doing long-range planning recently. And I've created a roadmap - a 10-year roadmap...it was actually a 12-year [roadmap] - I can see this, this, this and this and all these different things that we can do, [which] is really inspiring. And it's really exciting. We're focused on what players want...I can't tell you much more than that."</em></p>
<p>The shortest time between Diablo releases was the four years between the first and second games. After that, it was 12 years before Diablo III came around and another 11 years between Diablo III and Diablo IV. So telling players to expect another 10-year gap between series installments is nothing new, and it would be on the shorter side if Diablo V released precisely 10 years after Diablo IV.</p>
<p>As far as short-term plans go, Blizzard announced the<a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/"> 2025 roadmap for Diablo IV</a> less than a week ago at the time of writing, confirming that a new major expansion for Diablo IV won't arrive until sometime in 2026 and that in the meantime, the significant updates in 2025 will come in the form of seasonal changes and quality of life updates players are still waiting for, such as being able to use keyboard and mouse controls on a console, which won't arrive until sometime this summer, according to the current schedule.</p>
