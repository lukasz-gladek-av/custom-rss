			<p>SEGA and Relic Entertainment have announced Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition, a remaster of the original Warhammer 40K: Space Marine that initially launched on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC in 2011.</p>
<p>Announced during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls livestream event</a>, this remaster will be arriving on PC and Xbox Series X/S in a matter of weeks on <strong>June 10, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>There's currently no news regarding a potential PS5 launch, though it could just be because this will be a timed console-exclusive for Xbox Series consoles. It'll also be available to play through Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>Developer SneakyBox was the studio SEGA chose to work on this remaster, and is a "<em>thoughtful restoration</em>" of the original game, according to SneakyBox producer Vaidas Mikelskas (per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-warhammer-40000-space-marine-gets-surprise-master-crafted-edition-on-pc-and-xbox-game-pass-but-theres-no-ps5-version">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>"<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition isn't just a technical upgrade - it's a thoughtful restoration. We aimed to preserve the spirit of the original while modernizing the experience for today's players. This is more than just Master Crafted Edition, it's a respectful dialogue between past and present, preserving what made the original special while making it shine for a new generation of players</em>."</p>

<p>This new version lets players enjoy the first Space Marine game at 4K with remastered audio, an overhaul to the control scheme, improved character models, textures, and all of it is applied to the original game and every bit of downloadable content it received in the years after launch.</p>
<p>You can add the Space Marine Master Crafted Edition to your wishlist on Steam, Xbox, and the Epic Games Store, and it'll be available on June 10 for $39.99 USD. Last year, the long-awaited sequel, Space Marine 2, was one of the biggest games of the year. Though it might not have reinvented the wheel, it provided a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">very fun and bloody time, even if it was repetitive</a>.</p>
<p>Following up that success with a remaster of the first game is great news for fans of Space Marine 2, especially those new to the series, as they now have the chance to revisit the first game without having to play the original 14-year-old version.</p>
<p>Also announced during today's Warhammer Skulls event was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>, the next Warhammer CRPG from Owlcat.</p>
