			<p>Let It Die: Inferno is a new rougelite-survival game from developer GungHo Online Entertainment a the next game in the Let It Die series. Announced during yesterday's Sony State of Play event, it'll arrive on PC and PS5 this coming December 3, 2025.</p>



<p>Let It Die: Inferno is a PvEvP title that will constantly have you doing whatever you can to survive as you try to work your way towards the legendary 'Eye of the Reaper' treasure that can give whosoever finds it immense untold power.</p>



<p>You'll search for it by descending into the Hell Gate, plunging into its depths for this treasure to hopefully be the last one standing with it. On top of dealing with the creatures and demons you'll find on your way to the treasure, you'll also have to contend with other players in this third-person action roguelite.</p>

<p>"<em>Within the Hell Gate, all bests are off,</em>" writes Allyson Nicholas, associate community manager at GungHo Online Entertainment, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/survival-action-roguelite-let-it-die-inferno-launches-december-3-on-ps5/">a PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>In order to survive, players must not only fend off grotesque creatures and human enemies in melee-focused combat, but also other players. It's rougelite survival action in a chaotic PvEvP environment. Upon each descent, your Raider will be equipped with a character-specific weapon</em>, <em>which can be switched out with any weapon you find as you explore. All Raidrs are dual-wielding and the combination of weapons in your equipment slots will unlock new special attacks. Needless to say, no two playing experiences will be the same; stage layouts and item placements shift every descent, so players must use a strategic combination of unique weapons and special abilities to make it out alive</em>."</p>



<p>The last time we saw the Let It Die series was with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathverse-let-it-die-will-be-redeveloped-service-to-be-suspended-on-july-18/">free-to-play title Deathverse: Let It Die</a>, which was taken offline in 2023 to be "<em>redeveloped</em>" into something new. Well, GungHo Online Entertainment doesn't directly come out and say that Let It Die: Inferno is that redeveloped title, but that could very well be the case.</p>



<p>Regardless, at least Let It Die fans won't have to wait too long to check out Inferno with its December release date, and while it might not be free-to-play, it is only costing you $24.99 to jump in.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision is rumored to launch in Europe before the end of the month, retaining the price of the currently available model.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-version-de-la-ps5-pro-arriverait-bientot-voici-ce-que-lon-croit-en-savoir-60579">Dealabs</a> by billbil-kun, who has proven time and time again to be extremely reliable regarding new video games and hardware launches, it is claimed that a new hardware CFI-7121 hardware revision discovered via Japanese certification documents is in the works and set to be launched in Europe on September 30. The changes to this new hardware revision are expected to be limited to better energy efficiency, so there won't be any change to the console's design nor to the system's SSD capacity, which will remain at 2 TB as in the current model. It is also claimed the new hardware revision system will retain the current â‚¬799.99 price tag. A launch in North America is uncertain at the time.</p>



<p>Although the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision has yet to be confirmed officially, given billbil-kun's excellent track record and the listing of the new revision in the same certification documents that confirmed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-digital-edition-hardware-revision-smaller-ssd-price/">existance of the base model Digital Edition CFI-2000 revision</a>, which indeed launched in Europe this week, there's a high probability the system is indeed launching in the region in a few days. </p>



<p>This time around, however, there should be no need to rush to purchase the current PS5 Pro model, as storage will not be reduced as a not-so-subtle way to avoid raising the system's price, which is already high compared to every other current-generation system.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has plenty to offer over the base PlayStation 5 models, including support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">improve next year</a>. You can learn more about what the system exactly offers by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">checking out Kai's review</a>.</p>
