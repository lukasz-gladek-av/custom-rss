			<p>While there hasn't been a new main entry in the series in a long time - not counting the 2018's MMO - the Fallout series is more popular than ever thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Amazon Prime TV Show</strong></a>. The adaptation effectively rejuvenated the franchise, attracting millions of new players to its post-apocalyptic world and prompting them to explore older titles, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong>.</p>



<p>The series' resurgence has also breathed new life into an old debate among the community: the "purist" first two entries versus the first-person RPGs developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Bethesda Game Studios</strong>. According to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Chris Avellone</strong>, the lead developer of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> - which many feel is the true successor to the original top-down games - the series' current direction has a simple reason: Bethesda doesn't fully understand its roots. Nor does it care.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009457239694954576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009457239694954576%7Ctwgr%5Ebe45c50dada723054da89576b40cc48a3f92b2b1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Ffallout%2Fi-dont-think-bethesda-hates-fallout-says-new-vegas-lead-they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care%2F"><strong>Replying to a fan's question regarding whether Bethesda "hates" the original series on X</strong></a>, Avellone was remarkably clear: <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"I don’t think Bethesda hates Fallout, they just don’t fully understand its roots and arguably, don’t care - they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm."</em></p>



<p>This lack of deeper connection is what Avellone believes fuels the series' current design philosophy. <em>"This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout – and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me,"</em> Avellone pointed out.</p>



<p>Although these statements sound harsh, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout</strong> </em><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">New Vegas</em></strong> veteran clarified that he doesn't hate Bethesda, highlighting some of their strengths. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"There are things they do well (open world exploration), and there are things they do badly (telling linear stories in open world games and their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill). But every developer has their pros and cons,"</em> Avellone concluded.</p>



<p>As someone who loves the first two entries and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout </strong></em><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">New Vegas</em></strong>, but could never really get into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em></strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4</em></strong>, I can only agree with Avellone's sentiment. While the Bethesda entries are undeniably solid open-world RPGs, they often feel like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout</em> games only on the surface, missing those small elements that made the original games and the Obsidian title truly memorable.</p>



<p>Standing as one of the best modern entries in the series, a remastered <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> would be an extremely welcome release to tide fans over until the release of the inevitable fifth entry, which may not see the light of day for a long time, with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/"><strong>Bethesda still hard at work on </strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong></a>. Hopefully, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">recent rumors suggesting the game is </strong></a><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">returning soon</strong></a>&nbsp;will prove to be correct, allowing us to finally revisit</span> the Mojave Wasteland and experience it like never before.</p>

			<p>Ever since <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> signed a 10-year deal with <strong>Nintendo</strong></a> that promised to bring <strong>Call of Duty</strong> to Team Red's console in order to help get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard across the finish line, technically speaking, seeing the shooter franchise arrive on the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> (or more likely, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>) has been a sure thing.</p>



<p>We're four years into that deal, and still no Call of Duty on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, but a recent datamine spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-on-nintendo-switch-datamine">Eurogamer</a> seems to indicate that the shooter's arrival on the platform is "<em>imminent</em>."</p>



<p>Dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/2010381277011284375">Realityuk</a>, who has previously shared accurate datamined files related to Call of Duty updates, spotted a mention of Nintendo in the launcher code the last time they delved into Call of Duty HQ, and believes it is an indication that we'll see the official announcement the next time Nintendo hosts a major event. </p>



<p>This datamine comes just three weeks after a report pointing to Call of Duty arriving on Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/">sometime in 2026, potentially launching "<em>in a few months</em>."</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Back in 2022, when Microsoft's head of gaming, <strong>Phil Spencer</strong>, was first talking about the deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo's console,<a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-bringing-call-of-duty-to-switch-will-require-time/"> he admitted that it</a> "<em></em><em>would likely take a little bit of time</em>" to make the port happen. </p>



<p>Now that it has been "<em>a little bit of time</em>" since that deal was inked, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is not just a poorly-kept secret but the latest console on the market, it seems like we are coming very close to seeing the world's most popular shooter franchise arrive on the hybrid console.</p>



<p>Regardless, at least it's not a question of 'if' but just a question of 'when.' Hopefully, we'll hear more official news soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Division: Definitive Edition Seemingly Leaks at Ubisoft Event in Japan]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Tom Clancy's The Division</strong> initially launched on PC, PS4, and Xbox One on March 8, 2016, meaning that March 8, 2026, will mark the 10-year anniversary of the series launch. It's not entirely clear how <strong>Ubisoft</strong> intends to celebrate the occasion yet, but a poster spotted at the esports event, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6JP/status/1996490814843740451">FPS Day,</a> in Japan seems to have one indication of how, as event attendees shared pictures of a <strong><em>"The Division: Definitive Edition"</em></strong> poster online.</p>



<p>Shared to X (formerly Twitter) by multiple users, a large poster for The Division: Definitive Edition that seems to be legitimate was shared ahead of a 10th anniversary panel taking place at the event.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A 'Definitive Edition' of the first Division game has yet to be officially announced by Ubisoft, though we do know that there are several projects within the series in the works. At last week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDt-guVbQMs">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> executive producer <strong>Julian Gerighty</strong> shared some new information and gameplay on The Division 2: Survivors and The Division Resurgence, two upcoming titles that were first announced at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>.</p>



<p>He also spared <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">a few words for <strong>The Division 3</strong>,</a> saying, "<em></em><em>It's shaping up to be a monster</em>. <em>I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls, in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unclear what the 'Definitive Edition' of the initial game will look like, particularly because Ubisoft has already been adding new features to The Division to help celebrate the game's 10-year anniversary, like a <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505">60 FPS update for current-gen consoles that was released almost a month ago</a> at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>A video shared by the <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/2010628433223545297">official Ubisoft Japan X (formerly Twitter) account</a> also details how the company will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the first Division game with a special in-game event in The Division 2, but there's no mention of a 'Definitive Edition' for the first The Division game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this 'Definitive Edition' is a new version of the first Division game set to release for current-gen platforms, then we may only be hours away from the official confirmation at the aforementioned 10th anniversary panel. Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on what's happening, but did not receive a reply ahead of publishing. We'll update this article if/when we hear back.</p>
