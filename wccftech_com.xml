			<p>Call of Duty insider TheGhostofHope has <a href="https://x.com/theghostofhope/status/1867024363054305591?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> a few tidbits he heard about the 2026 game. According to his sources, that entry will feature both omnimovement and wall running.</p>
<p>Omnimovement is a feature introduced this year in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 by Treyarch. It allows players to perform actions in any direction for the first time in the series. If they want to shoot left and right while sprinting, they can; the same goes for running forward or backward. Also, they can do all these things while sprinting, sliding to avoid fire, sliding under an obstacle, or diving through a window. The only thing they can't do in all directions is Tactical Sprint, as Operators can only perform Tactical Sprint while moving forward.</p>
<p>In Wccftech's review of Black Ops 6, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>While jumping forward and diving is nothing new for the series, dolphin diving only really worked to evade forwards. What Omnimovement brings to the table is the same expanded movement, but in any direction, like playing out the good bits of a John Woo action scene. In proper multiplayer, expect to deal with many folks diving sideways through doors or sliding right into your shins when you least expect.</em></p>
<p>While omnimovement has encountered a generally positive reception among fans, the return of wall running from far less beloved Call of Duty games like Black Ops 3 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review-single-is-better-than-multi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infinite Warfare</a> may not sit well with most fans. Moreover, TheGhostofHope's mention of remastered maps from 2011's Modern Warfare 3 may be met with similar disdain, as those aren't exactly fan favorites, either.</p>
<p>Of course, there's a long time between now and 2026. Before Infinity Ward's next Call of Duty installment, it will be Sledgehammer's turn, the studio behind the underwhelming Vanguard and Modern Warfare III. So far, the only concrete rumor about 2025's CoD is that it might have wall running, too.</p>

			<p>Today, Heart Machine revealed that Hyper Light Breaker, the 3D follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, will be released in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access on Steam</a> on January 14, 2025. This news came during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition, where a trailer was released to reveal the official Early Access date for the game. For those interested, Hyper Light Breaker will cost $29.99 during the Early Access period, with the price subject to change depending on content added to the game and changes made to the title.</p>
<p>This game is published by Arc Games, which has also published games like Torchlight, Neverwinter, and Remnant 2. For those who are unfamiliar with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-gameplay-trailer-stylish-action-no-mans-sky/">Hyper Light universe</a>, Hyper Light Breaker is a co-op open-world roguelike where players get to assume the role of a "Breaker," with multiple different Breakers to choose from. Breakers are warriors who are tasked with rebuilding a civilization that was ruined due to a cataclysmic war. To do so, you get to explore a vast and ever-changing world in a procedurally generated world that is known as the Overgrowth.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyper Light Breaker | Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VijrcUbspqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During the exploration, you'll get to come across secrets hidden in nooks and crannies while battling against the Crowns, which are bosses controlled by the Abyss King.</p>
<p>While this game is a follow-up game to Hyper Light Drifter, it isn't in terms of story. It's set in the universe like their previous game, but Hyper Light Breaker takes place several decades before the events that happened in the first game. Luckily, to play Hyper Light Breaker, it isn't required for the player to have played Hyper Light Drifter, as the game is set to be a stand-alone experience.</p>
<p>Much like many other roguelikes, Hyper Light Breaker will have intense and difficult combat, where players have to use the loot that they have on them to upgrade their gear and become more powerful with each new run. Every time the player dies, the Overgrowth regenerates but will never be the exact same as the world you experienced previously. While this is a common feature in many different roguelikes, this is a first for the Hyper Light universe and gives it a similar feeling to that of Risk of Rain 2, a game that shares a lot of similarities with this upcoming title.</p>
<p>Heart Machine has stated that Hyper Light Breaker will continue to receive support and updates beyond the Early Access launch, with the developers planning on adding new Breakers to choose from, new bosses to fight and weapons to utilize, to keep the game fresh.</p>
