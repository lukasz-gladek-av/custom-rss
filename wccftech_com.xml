			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> has, as it does each week, the latest <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD Sales Data</a> for the top-selling games in the EU. This time, the weekly sales are from the week of November 24-30, which includes all of the Black Friday sales numbers, with EA Sports FC 26 winning the day in both sales by revenue and units sold. Meanwhile, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was able to stay ahead of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In fairness, both of fall 2025's popular shooters were in the top five for the week, with Black Ops 7 riding its launch wave and Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-amazon/">getting put on a fairly significant Black Friday sale</a>, though the discount <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-loses-ground-eu-sales-charts-black-friday-sales/">wasn't enough to change the rankings from the week before</a>, with Black Ops 7 still holding fast just above Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy was another notable entry in the charts. Even though it came in eighth place on the sales by revenue chart, it shot up all the way to second place in the units sold chart, beating Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6. Red Dead Redemption 2 rounded out the top five units sold list, while on the revenue charts, after Battlefield 6 in third, Pokémon Legends Z-A and NBA 2K26 rounded out the top five in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>



<p>None of the entries in the revenue chart or units sold chart were brand new releases, with everyone taking advantage of Black Friday sales to pick up older games they had been eyeing. In fact, the most recent release on both charts was technically Black Ops 7, since it's the only game on either top ten list that released in November 2025.</p>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by units sold for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>F1 25</li>
</ol>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by revenue for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>

<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2</li>
</ol>



<p>Elsewhere in The Game Business' report, on the hardware side of things per NielsenIQ, it was the PlayStation 5, not the Nintendo Switch 2, that was the hottest hardware item of the week. Not that the Switch 2 was a slouch, but significant discounts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-available-at-lowest-price-of-648-99-on-amazon-despite-sale-period-ended/">on the PS5 Pro</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-takes-100-off-ps5-for-black-friday-sales/"> base PS5 models</a> helped push it to be, according to The Game Business, the only console to actually improve on its sales numbers compared to last year.</p>



<p>Overall, not the most surprising Black Friday sales charts. Popular sports games and first-person shooters are at the top of the charts, with the rest of the list filled up by regulars on the charts like Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>



<p>Though you do wonder if Microsoft continues to change how it delivers its games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-xbox-exec-says-microsoft-would-be-delighted-to-avoid-making-hardware-and-delivering-games-netflix-style/">particularly if it goes full-on into the Netflix-style distribution as former executive Peter Moore suggested</a>, will Call of Duty or any other Microsoft-owned game still make these charts, or will the subscription-based focus leave a gap for other games to claim a spot as one of the regularly best-selling games week-to-week?</p>

            <guid>1376146</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima is no stranger to creating unique experiences that challenge established gameplay formulas. With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">Death Stranding series</a></strong>, the legendary creator of the Metal Gear Solid series has created open-world experiences that are markedly different from anything else on the market, transforming a desolate post-apocalyptic world into the perfect setting for players to form meaningful bonds through gameplay. With the horror game OD, however, it sounds like the legendary creator will push video game boundaries even further, as he isn't sure the experience will work out in the end.</p>



<p>As translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Automaton</strong></a>, Kojima-san recently talked about OD and the challenges the game will face in a new interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>ananweb</strong></a>. <em>"I can’t say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will work out. We’ve created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games. This time, we’re trying to change the service model from the ground up, so it should be quite challenging,"</em> Kojima-san said.</p>



<p>While we still don't know exactly how OD will play, according to Hideo Kojima, there's already a way to understand the experience better. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"We’ve packed <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">the trailer</a></strong> full of hints, so if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out."</em> </p>



<p>I, for one, am not ashamed to admit I haven't any clue about the game as much as anyone else. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"><strong>OD being so different from anything else</strong></a> is making me quite excited about what it will offer over traditional horror games, which deserve a major shake-up since they haven't really moved past the experience established by the Resident Evil series in any significant way.</p>



<p>As for when we will be able to understand more about OD, no one can say. With Hideo Kojima having released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach this year (and with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-esrb-published-by-sony/">a PC port</a></strong> likely getting announced during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a>), it may be a while until the studio is ready to unveil a project that sounds more promising by the day.</p>

			<p>Lunar Software's long-awaited horror game ROUTINE is finally out and on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One devices, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">even for a game that was announced more than a decade ago</a>, it has the sensibilities of a game older than that. Needless to say, there are a few things you'll want to know when jumping into it yourself.</p>



<p>This guide will take you through a few essential tips and tricks to ensure you can see everything ROUTINE has to offer, without getting terribly lost.</p>



<h2 id="h-routine-tips-and-tricks-guide">ROUTINE Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-have-a-notebook-ready">Have a notebook ready</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.11.27-23.07.22.86.png"></a><figcaption><em>Just like any good astronaut, you'll want to keep a record of what happens on the moon in ROUTINE.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't give you waypoints, map markers, or a compass to tell you which direction you're going in. It doesn't even give you a map to look at. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, it's the second game in 2025 to make getting around its environment and figuring out where to go next is a constant puzzle, which is part of the game's draw, as you're constantly building a mental map of each area.</p>



<p>You can do that, or you can draw a map of the space in a notebook to help you get around. That could be reason enough to have a notebook ready, but the better reason to have a notebook and pen beside you - or something to take notes with at least - is all the code puzzles you'll need to solve.</p>



<p>Having a notebook to write down every code you uncover is probably the best thing you can do to make sure you have a smooth time with ROUTINE. Instead of risking a moment where you've successfully made it to where you need to enter the code you just solved, and you have to backtrack to where you solved it because you can't remember the code.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-c-a-t-is-everything-but-it-s-got-nothing-on-plain-old-hiding">Your C.A.T. is everything, but it's got nothing on plain-old hiding</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_005_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>Your C.A.T. is useful, but it can't do everything.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your only tool and the one thing that lets you communicate with the abandoned lunar base, your C.A.T. (Cosmonaut Assistance Tool), is pretty much your everything in ROUTINE. It's how you save when you find a save point; it's how you scan your environment for otherwise invisible writings that reveal secrets and help you solve puzzles, and it's how you fight back against the robots trying to kill you.</p>



<p>But fighting back will only get you so far. Whoever made these robots made them to last, and while two electric shots from your C.A.T. directly into a robot's chest in short succession can stun them, no amount of shots will actually take them down. Stunning them can give you a window to run and hide, but running and hiding is always going to be what actually gets them off your back, and the chance to progress further in the story.</p>



<h3 id="h-not-every-robot-is-trying-to-kill-you-at-the-same-time">Not every robot is trying to kill you - at the same time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_004_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the many things not directly explained to you in ROUTINE is that while you'll see plenty of killer robots on the base, they aren't all trying to kill you - at the same time. No more than one robot is activated at any time, so as you start learning where the robots are in the rooms you're exploring, if you know which one is active, you can walk right by another with no fear.</p>



<p>Unless, of course, it activates right in front of you. In that case, you might be screwed if you can't run away in time.</p>



<h3 id="h-there-are-safe-rooms-but-no-safe-pausing">There are safe rooms, but no safe pausing</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.02-02.47.05.85.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sometimes, these access points that allow you to save are in 'safe rooms,' but not all the time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-finally-gets-first-combat-footage-but-leon-is-nowhere-to-be-seen/">Capcom's Resident Evil series</a> is known for its safe rooms, the areas you reach where any of the horrors you're shooting at can't get to you. They're accompanied by their own music and a few repeating hallmarks so that when you find one, you know you can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't have safe rooms in the same way Resident Evil has safe rooms, but they are there. You just have to look closely. What you can't do is pause the game and think you're safe.</p>



<p>All pressing the pause button does is bring up the game's menu; you can still die if you pause and leave yourself directly in the patrol path of a robot. So if you do need to adjust something in the menu, or step away for a moment, make sure you're actually safe before doing so.</p>



<h3 id="h-really-look-around-and-then-look-again">Really look around, and then look again</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.01-02.16.42.25.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE forces you to slow down and pay attention to your environment, so don't start to panic if you're having trouble finding your way.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As stated earlier, ROUTINE doesn't include any of the modern gaming comforts, like an in-game map. Figuring out where to go means you have to look around you and see what the environment is telling you.</p>



<p>That setup can, and probably will, make it easy for you to feel like you're lost. But Lunar Software's limitations on what kind of assistance you get means that you only have to look in a few places to figure out where to go next.</p>



<p>While some chapters include bouncing between different areas on different floors, most of ROUTINE will involve you navigating a large section of the base connected with hallways and, in some cases, through vents and backdoor entrances. If you really feel lost, keep looking around and zoom in on everything you see. Taking your time to do this will likely result in you figuring out where to go faster than if you tried to speed to the answer.</p>
