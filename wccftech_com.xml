			<p>2025 is going to see a lot of massive releases across a multitude of genres. Narrowing it down to the sports and racing games in particular, there are a fair few games that are going to be released this year that will be major hits for petrolheads and sports fans. If you want to know what games you should be putting on your calendar this year, make sure to keep reading for Wccftech's most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025.</p>

<h2>Assetto Corsa EVO (Out Now on PC via Steam)</h2>
<p>Assetto Corsa is a very popular racing game franchise, and the latest iteration has just been released, albeit on early access. There isn't a date set yet for when Assetto Corsa EVO is going to be on consoles just yet, so those on console will have to wait a little bit longer for this hyperrealistic racing game. What we do know is that Assetto Corsa EVO is set to have its full launch between September and December. The game will feature extensive modding support, as well as consistent updates to keep the game fresh once it has experienced its full launch, when it will include 100 cars and 15 officially licensed circuits (with 5 more tracks following afterward as free updates). Before that, KUNOS <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will add an open world map sometime this Summer</a>.</p>
<p>If you jump in right now, though, you'll already find 20 cars from several classes and 5 circuits across the continents: Laguna Seca (America), Brands Hatch and Imola (Europe), Mount Panorama (Australia), and Suzuka (Japan). When it comes to modes, the early access launch build features Practice sessions, Quick Races, the brand new Driving Academy, and the Hotstint and Test Drive special events.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>WWE 2K25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>WWE is a popular franchise that helps boost profits for both Take-Two Interactive. This game was mentioned during the earnings call, where they mentioned both the potential release of PGA Tour 2K25 and, of course, WWE 2K25. Since 2000, WWE has received a new game every year except for 2021, where there was no game released at all. Since then, it's gone back to regular scheduling, and it's likely that WWE 2K25 will be released this year. It doesn't have a set release date as of yet, but it was mentioned in the earnings call that the game will be released before March 31, 2025. This would make sense, as the past three WWE games (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-improved WWE 2K24</a>) were all released in early March.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>iRacing NASCAR 25 (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>It's been a long time coming, but NASCAR fans are finally getting a new game in the franchise. It's been three years since the last iteration aside from NASCAR 21: Ignition, but most people don't count that as an actual game in the series. iRacing NASCAR 25 was first heard of in 2023, when iRacing purchased the NASCAR license from Motorsport Games. This game will be built in Unreal Engine alongside Monster Games and is currently planned to launch on consoles, while a PC release is still up in the air.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maxresdefault-14-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (TBA - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>This game was first showcased at The Game Awards 2024, where Sega released a trailer for this upcoming game. The release date is currently unknown, but it is set to debut "soon." All we know is that the developers have promised a distinct racing mechanic that will 'transport Sonic racing fans into a new dimension.'</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be available across all platforms (including Nintendo's) and, like its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/team-sonic-racing-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Sonic Racing</a>, could be the perfect game to get youngsters into gaming and engage in some friendly competition.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wreckfest_2_Keyart-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Wreckfest 2 (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole sports and racing games genre, there isn't anything quite like Wreckfest. The spiritual successor to FlatOut <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-announced-with-new-car-customization-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returns in 2025</a> after 2018's first installment. We don't know a lot about it yet, although Finnish developer Bugbear Entertainment has promised improved destruction thanks to the more accurate physics engine and better sounds, with the latter being boasted as among the best in a racing title. So far, the main new feature is the ability to customize your vehicle. More info will undoubtedly be shared ahead of the launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-snap-is-down-in-the-us-following-tiktok-ban-but-devs-are-%E2%80%98working-to-restore-service%E2%80%99.1086324/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvel-snap-is-down-in-the-us-following-tiktok-ban-but-devs-are-working-to-restore-service/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The extremely popular collectible card game Marvel Snap suddenly became inaccessible to United States users <a href="https://wccftech.com/tiktok-officially-banned-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the TikTok ban</a> due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). Here's the message that greets anyone who tries to log in (also available <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social channels</a>):</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable on U.S. stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, MARVEL SNAP was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18th.</em></p>
<p><em>MARVEL SNAP isn't going anywhere. We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.</em></p>
<p>The reason is pretty straightforward: TikTok creator ByteDance owns Nuverse, the publisher of the game. All apps owned by ByteDance were banned, including Marvel Snap. However, since the game itself isn't related to TikTok at all, there may be enough wiggle room for them to restore service.</p>
<p>Developed by Second Dinner, the free-to-play game launched in October 2022 for Windows PC, Android, and iOS devices. It featured over 170 Marvel characters on release, and the roster has greatly increased over time due to weekly additions.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Marvel Snap isn't too complicated. Each player has a deck of 12 cards, each one representing a Marvel character with a cost, power level, and possibly a special ability. At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously place one or more cards face down in one of three locations. The locations are randomly assigned for each game, and each location has a unique associated effect. At the end of each round, the cards are revealed and their special abilities are triggered. Whoever has the highest power in a given location wins that location; the goal is to win two of the three locations.</p>
<p>Its relative simplicity won over many fans. Last we heard, Marvel Snap had over 22 million players and has earned more than $200 million in revenue since launch.</p>

			<p>If you're looking for some scares to see you into the new year, there are plenty of great ones scattered throughout the next 12 months. Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saw some fantastic horror games</a>, but this year also has a ton of potential if you're looking for multiplayer horror or single-player horror experiences.</p>
<p>Here's our shortlist for the five most anticipated horror games of 2025. All of them will be available on all main platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), and they also share the trait of not having a fixed launch date yet.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a></em></p>

<h2>Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a bit more of a horror game compared to the survival elements of the previous iterations in the franchise. While they, too, had a slight horror vibe, it seems to be more of a focus in this game. You follow the story of Kyle Crane, who returns from the first entry, and the experiments that he underwent, which gave him significant strength and power. However, it comes at a cost. You have to work to keep the remaining survivors of Castor Woods safe while keeping your powers in check. While the signature parkour is still here, the ability to drive vehicles also returns from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Following</a>. Read <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our interview from Gamescom 2024</a> to learn even more about this standalone game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cronos-the-new-dawn-jco6q.jpg"></a></figure>


<h2>Cronos: The New Dawn</h2>
<p>This is the latest game from Bloober Team, a previously controversial developer <span>who became a superstar after the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. According to the Polish developers, it is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by the survival mechanics of Resident Evil and Dead Space</span>. The story will see players traveling between past and future: in the past, they'll experience a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that has changed humanity forever. In the future, which has become a ravaged wasteland, they'll fight for survival against dangerous abominations.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the protagonist is a time traveler, an agent for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of specific time rifts that will transport them back to 1980s Poland. In the past, the mission is to locate key figures who perished in The Change, save them, and bring them into the future to change it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p>Little Nightmares is a beloved franchise in the horror games community, and it's not hard to see why. On the surface level, it seems like a cutesy little puzzle game with horror sprinkled in, but it often tells a much more horrifying story in character design and environments. <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>, which was originally scheduled to launch in 2024, is the next game in the series and brings optional (you can also play with the AI) co-op multiplayer to the franchise, which is a massive step for the Little Nightmares games. We can only hope it won't be as damaging as it was for Dead Space, which also added co-op with its third installment.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020</h2>
<p>For the most part, you can't go wrong with games in The Dark Pictures Anthology. The last game in The Dark Pictures Anthology was the spin-off VR-exclusive game named <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-dark-pictures-switchback-vr-qa-supermassive-talks-utilizing-ps-vr2s-fantastic-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switchback</a>. However, this is the first game in the second and final season of the horror series created by Supermassive Games.</p>
<p>The game stars actress Lashana Lynch as Brianna Young, an astronaut and pilot of a colony ship called Cassiopeia, which crash-lands on Tau Ceti f, a planet 12 light-years away, after setting out to find a new home to save humanity as Earth is dying. The game's creative director has described it as "The Thing in deep space," which is certainly an intriguing premise as far as horror games go.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Tormented Souls 2</h2>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tormented-souls-replicating-classics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tormented Souls</a> was a rather brilliant survival horror game for a first outing, and it is now getting a sequel. In this game, you reprise the role of Caroline Walker and get to explore brand-new horrifying locations that promise to keep you on edge the entire time. After the events of the first game, Caroline longs for a normal life with her younger sister, Anna. However, Anna suddenly falls ill due to a mysterious affliction against which conventional remedies prove futile. In a desperate attempt to save her sister, Caroline must turn to the supernatural again, heading to the remote and sinister Southern American town of Puerto Miller, where she'll be forced to explore eerie monasteries and other nightmarish locations to discover how to help Anna.</p>
