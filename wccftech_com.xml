			<p>Today, Build A Rocket Boy and IO Partners announced the launch date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creators-mindseye-game-slated-to-launch-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindsEye</a>. The upcoming single-player narrative-driven action/adventure game will be released on June 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders for digital and physical editions are now open at $59.99 / €59.99 / £54.99. Interestingly, there's only one edition for the time being; every pre-order automatically gets a free upgrade to the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Premium Pass, the Deluxe Thorn &amp; Kepler Yellowjacket Weapon, the Future Jacob Vest Skin, the Future DC2 Companion Drone Skin, and the Future Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin.</p>
<p>The Premium Pass includes the following in-game items:</p>
<p>• Pack 1 "Exotic Pack" ("Exotic" Jacob Vest Skin, "Exotic" DC2 Companion Drone Skin, "Exotic" Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin)</p>
<p>• Horde Mode Mission: Face a variety of enemies with distinct tactics and behaviors. Think fast and use your surroundings to outmaneuver your opponents.</p>
<p>• Pack 2: Extra missions and challenges in Q3 2025</p>
<p>• Pack 3: Extra missions and challenges in Q4 2025</p>
<p>• Pack 4: Extra missions and challenges in Q1 2026</p>
<p>MindsEye owners will also get access to bonus missions built in ARCADIA, Build A Rocket Boy’s custom building and distribution tool that enables rapid creation of AAA content. This was previously known as Everywhere; indeed, MindsEye was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> two years ago as a side experience to this project. However, it quickly became its own separate game and took over the spotlight.</p>
<p>Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye and former producer of every GTA game from III to V, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences unravel.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Welcome to Redrock - Official Story Trailer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oprmuMXtfAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The news was accompanied by a new story trailer that provides a glimpse of technology's immersive influence on Redrock, where consumer robots perform most manual tasks, and an algorithm connects all-seeing devices. The city itself is a living experiment in the existential potential of man and machine. We also see a few dialogues between the main characters.</p>
<p>In MindsEye, players take the role of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier fitted with the titular neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Jacob must uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unbridled military power shape every encounter. However, Jacob won't be the only one searching for answers, and the forces operating in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. The developers say players should prepare for intense combat - on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air - where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/us-retailer-documents-reveals-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In some new documents and internal emails provided to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a> from a large US retailer, they are anticipating that they will sell out of the Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day that pre-orders are open due to limited unit allocation from Nintendo. Thus far, information about the Nintendo Switch 2 has been limited, with a Nintendo Direct taking place yesterday to unveil some new games that are coming to its predecessor. However, the Nintendo Switch 2 is due to get its very own direct on April 2, which will give people the highly anticipated look at the new console that they've been waiting for.</p>
<p>According to the documents sent to Insider Gaming, the Nintendo Switch 2 is allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">scheduled to release in June</a>, which has been widely rumored across a span of communities and was spoken about by developers at GDC.</p>
<p>For some there may be a touch of confusion about when pre-orders go live, as there was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Buy Canada leak earlier</a> on in the week that said that pre-orders would be going live on April 2, the day of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. That post has since been removed by Best Buy Canada, but the retailer hasn't issued a response as of yet.</p>
<p>At this moment in time, it's uncertain whether or not the Best Buy Canada "leak" was a mistake or not as the company hasn't commented on the situation. However, as soon as it began to circulate online and feed into rumors, it was promptly removed.</p>
<p>In the documents sent to Insider Gaming, it's reported that pre-orders will actually be going live on April 9, which is one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents also contained information about a marketing strategy to include a Countdown Clock, with Nintendo allegedly confirming the time on April 2. It also says that there will be an exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>
<p>However, as we have not personally seen these documents, it's uncertain whether this is factual or not, and all of this information is subject to change at any point, with major details being set to release during the Direct.</p>
<p>While we still don't know the date of pre-orders, there is a high chance that it will be shortly after the Direct, most likely within a week of the Direct taking place.</p>
