			<p>Although the excellent Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was the first taste of a JRPG not developed by a Japanese studio for many, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is hardly the first JRPG developed by a French team. Years ago, Midgar Studio released <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/edge-of-eternity/">Edge of Eternity</a>, a solid open-world JRPG inspired by series like Final Fantasy and Xenogears, combining a vast world with a strategic turn-based combat system that made the experience rather remarkable, even with some of its issues. Years after work on the game has been completed, Midgar Studio is set to continue their franchise with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/edge-of-memories/">Edge of Memories</a>, a very different game than its predecessor but one that fans of certain types of action role-playing games will want to keep their eyes on.</p>



<p>During this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a>, I had the chance to briefly try out the game while speaking with Jérémy Zeler-Maury, Midgar Studio founder and CEO, who showed the same passion he did when I met him back in 2016 for an early look at Edge of Eternity. As soon as I picked up the controller to explore a world ravaged by a mysterious plague known as the Corrosion in the role of the Soul Whisperer Eline, I couldn't help but notice the extreme similarities the game developed by Midgar Studio has with last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visions-of-mana-ps5/">Visions of Mana</a>. According to the Midgar Studio CEO, I wasn't the only one to do so, as, when Square Enix revealed the new entry in the Mana series, many told him they thought it was Edge of Memories that had been revealed. While these similarities are inevitably going to impact the game's reception, and wrongly, as Edge of Memories has been in development long before Visions of Mana got announced, the uncertain future of the Square Enix series could definitely benefit the game, as, aside from a similar, colorful art direction, the Midgar Studio title definitely seems more involving, especially in combat.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Edge of Memories looks a lot like Visions of Mana, but don't let appearances deceive you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While my time with Edge of Memories was short, the demo did an excellent job highlighting some exploration and traversal mechanics, which require players to use the proper elemental powers to open up the way, and some light platforming segments that often take advantage of these mechanics. What was really striking besides the implementation of these mechanics was the nice sense of scale the world, and the fact that I was able to get to any location which looked interesting enough from a distance, although, given the short time and the focused demo, this may not be a thing in the final release.</p>



<p>It's in the combat mechanics, however, that Edge of Memories sets itself apart more from Visions of Mana. Fighting enemies in the Midgar Studio game is considerably more involving, with multiple combo strings, skills sets that can be switched on the fly, and a general more action-oriented feel which aims to recreate the feel of NieR Automata, as Jeremy pointed out as I was trying to take down a boss with multiple targets launching area of effect attacks whose range was highlighted by red circles on the ground, in the vein of modern Mana series games. Not having had a lot of time to delve into these systems, I cannot say if Edge of Memories will feature the same combo freedom as the PlatinumGames-developed title, but controlling Eline felt smooth enough to make combat enjoyable even with minimal knowledge of the game's intricacies.</p>



<p>With Nacon publishing the game after acquiring Midgar Studio in 2022, Edge of Memories won't have to go through an Early Access period when it launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. I hope the game will launch sooner rather than later, as I am excited to see what else it will have to offer, and if it will be as good as the short Gamescom demo suggested.</p>

			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is undoubtedly the best-looking version of the third entry in the series created by Hideo Kojima, the pachislot version released a few years ago doesn't look bad at all, even surpassing the Unreal Engine 5 remake developed by Virtuos in some regards.</p>



<p>Two new comparison videos shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> on YouTube put the remake running side by side with the HD remake developed by Bluepoint which was re-released two years ago as part of the Master Collection Vol.1 on PC and consoles and recordings of the same cutscenes recreated for the pachislot version of the game, highlighting how the latter don't look bad at all, sometimes even surpassing the Unreal Engine 5-powered remake in some instances like lighting, although this was to be expected, considering these cutscenes are not running in real time.</p>

<p>Despite launching with issues, including a 60 FPS cap on PC, which can be increased with mods, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has proven to be a smashing success, becoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/">a million seller</a> right on day one, as confirmed by Konami last week. The game's success on the market was fully expected, considering this is the first new release in the series in a long time and the fact that all the changes made to the original experience enhance it quite a bit without taking away what still makes Snake Eater one of the best entries in the series, if not the very best.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a more challenging game than its predecessor, but a few mods released online in the past few days can make the experience more manageable and fun without breaking the difficulty and making the entire experience a walk in the park.</p>



<p>An essential mod to download, even for those who aren't finding the game too difficult, is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/21?">Always Have Compass Effect mod</a>, which always shows Hornet's position on the map without equipping the Compass, freeing up a charm slot for more beneficial effects. Unfortunately, this mod isn't compatible with the Game Pass version of the game.</p>



<p>Another Hollow Knight: Silksong mod that can make the experience more balanced without breaking difficulty is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/57">No More 2 Damage Plus mod</a>, which reduces every damage Hornet takes to just one point per hit. While this sounds like a small tweak, it's actually a rather big one against certain enemies with rapid-hitting attacks that can destroy Hornet quickly, making the game somewhat more fair.</p>



<p>The third and final Hollow Knight: Silksong mod, which can improve the experience considerably, is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/55?tab=description">All Enemies Drop Rosary Beads</a>, which does exactly what its name suggests, making every enemy in the game drop Rosary Beads when defeated, instead of just the few enemies in the vanilla game. The formula used to calculate how many Beads an enemy drops is based on the extra bead = floor(max health / 5), which some are finding to be a little too much, but if you don't care about breaking the in-game's economy, this is a very useful mod to install.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlaYStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is not precisely a puzzle-heavy survival horror game, but that doesn't mean that you won't have to collect and place items correctly or <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-whats-the-passcode-for-the-storeroom-lock/">discover passcodes</a> to open up locked doors. In most cases, doors locked with passcodes are not mandatory to unlock to proceed in the main mission, but they should still be opened to obtain always-needed resources and additional items that can be used to solve puzzles, which unlock new weapons when completed.</p>



<p>This is the case of the <strong>locked door found in the Hospital Director's room</strong>. The first time you encounter this room will be while The Traveler has to explore Unity Hospital to obtain three samples to synthesize the Biomass Dissolving Toxin. No sample is hidden inside this room, but you will still want to open it to <strong>get an item required to complete the Chapel's puzzle located near the main save point on the first floor of the Hospital.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shooting gas cans in Cronos: The New Dawn is often the solution to puzzles</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To discover the passcode</strong>, you must proceed in the same wing as the Director's Room until you reach a massive room with a lot of Biomass. From this room's entrance, head to the left until you reach <strong>a blocked door on your left, and a crouching point in front of you</strong>. Press the X or B button to enter a new area and then turn to the left where you will find a window with a broken window looking into the locked room. Shoot the gas can to burn the Biomass blocking the door to be able to enter the room, grab every item, and check the document, which will tell you the locked room passcode: <strong>9509</strong>. You can also input the passcode directly without discovering the document first, in case you are not in the mood for some exploration.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Chalice found inside the locked room in Cronos: The New Dawn Hospital Director's room</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Inside the room, you will find some resources as well as the Chalice, which can be used to complete the aforementioned Chapel puzzle and, in turn, obtain the Mace JER-5120 shotgun, a modified variant of the regular Hammer shotgun which trades charged shots with a powerful double shot.</p>

			<p>Like many modern games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> hardly ends when the main campaign is completed. After experiencing one of the two endings and seeing the credits roll, a couple of new play modes are unlocked - <strong>New Game Plus and Hard Mode.</strong> While at a glance, Hard Mode may have more to offer to those who mastered the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">core mechanics</a>, <strong>New Game Plus may be more worthwhile to go through</strong>, as it provides something to those who have enjoyed the game's story.</p>



<p>Regarding gameplay differences, New Game Plus mode in Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't offer much. <strong>Item and enemy placement will be the same as in the first playthrough</strong>, so you should be able to breeze through this mode with relative ease, considering you will<strong> keep every upgrade unlocked during your first playthrough</strong>. As such, playing the game again in New Game Plus mode is the only way to <strong>unlock some of the Trophies and Achievements</strong>, including the May It Serve You Fault-Free achievement for fully upgrading a single weapon, The Praetorian for fully upgrading every weapon, and Forged In Fire for fully upgrading the Temporal Shell.</p>



<p><em><strong>SPOILER ALERT - Avoid reading below the screenshot if you haven't completed the game, as there are plenty of spoilers ahead regarding late-game beats and endings.</strong></em></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn New Game Plus mode has a lot to offer to those who enjoyed the game's storyu</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, even if you aren't a Trophy or Achievement hunter, you will have a very good reason to complete Cronos: The New Dawn's New Game Plus mode if you have loved the game's story. After defeating The Pathfinder on the Clocktower at the end of the game, you will be presented with<strong> three choices</strong> instead of two, and by picking the <strong>Begin Anew</strong> choice, you will unlock <strong>Ending C</strong>, which is, possibly, the most hopeful ending of the three, and one that all those who liked the story will surely appreciate.</p>
