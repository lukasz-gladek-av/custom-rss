			<p>Although pre-release footage suggested the contrary, the Nintendo Switch 2 makes widespread use of NVIDIA DLSS, but it may be difficult to notice if the upscaler is being used due to differences in image characteristics compared to PC.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during this week's episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry highlighted how the new Nintendo consoles makes widespread use of the NVIDIA upscaler, saying that it was difficult to say if this was indeed the case before launch due to the image characteristics of Switch 2 DLSS being different from those seen on PC. Based on certain visual elements, however, it is now possible to say if a game is using NVIDIA DLSS on the system, such as the disocclusion and aliased edges patterns seen in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet update.</p>
<p>Looking further into the matter, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> tech experts also highlighted how there's a good chance that NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2 comes with different modes, like on PC. The most common version seems to be a lightweight version that can easily upscale the resolution to 1080p in handheld mode and to 1440p or 4K in docked mode, but that doesn't do a great job of reconstructing the image in motion. The most glaring example is in Fast Fusion, where NVIDIA DLSS is used to upscale to 4K resolution in docked mode. Image quality is fine in still shots, but in motion, things are much different. Hogwarts Legacy seems to use this lightweight version of DLSS as well, only that the much slower pace of the game, and the higher base resolution deliver much better results, although different from what the upscaler delivers on PC. Besides this lightweight version, however, there seems to be at least another version of NVIDIA DLSS available to developers, as the implementation seen in Cyberpunk 2077 seems to be closer to the PC version, rather than the one seen in the other launch titles.</p>

<p>Besides supporting NVIDIA DLSS to deliver better image quality and performance upscaling from lower resolutions, the Nintendo Switch 2 offers plenty of unexpected benefits via its backward compatibility feature. Although updated games take better advantage of the increased system specs over the original system, several unpatched games can<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/"> brute-force better performance in several different titles.</a></p>

			<p>Although Stellar Blade developer Shift Up recently acquired a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit, a port of their popular game is not currently in development.</p>
<p>A new report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayForum,</a>&nbsp;translated from Korean by&nbsp;<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-switch-2-port-not-confirmed-yet-shift-up-clarifies-in-response-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton Media,</a> confirmed that Shift Up recently acquired a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit that will allow the studio to develop games for the console.&nbsp;Reportedly, the studio has begun designing content that reflects the console's specifications and unique features, using the experience gained developing Stellar Blade on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>Though a port is quite likely, considering both the game's and the Nintendo Switch 2's success, a new version of Stellar Blade is not already in development. A Shift Up representative confirmed to PlayForum that they have nothing to confirm regarding a Switch 2 port, as the studio is currently reviewing various possibilities internally.</p>
<p>After being a PlayStation 5 exclusive for about one year, Stellar Blade finally made its debut on PC last week. The game has quickly become a smashing success on the platform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">selling 1 million units in only three days</a>, bringing the total number of units sold to over 3 million. This success on the market is wholly deserved, as it is an engaging action role-playing game, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the early sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (the new gaming hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over 3.5 million units in the first four days and is said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling</a> twice as fast as the original Switch), gaming market analysis firm DFC Intelligence has slightly bumped its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original forecast for 2025</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now the key driver of industry growth for 2025. DFC has increased its forecast for Switch 2 unit sales from 15 million to 16 million. If manufacturing could meet demand, the Switch 2 could sell as many as 20 million units, but DFC considers this unlikely as Nintendo is expected to take a conservative approach to inventory.</em></p>
<p><em>Reflecting its historically conservative approach to new product forecasting, Nintendo is estimating sales of 15 million Switch 2 units through the end of its fiscal year in March 2026. When the original Switch launched in March 2017, Nintendo initially projected 10 million units for the fiscal year but ultimately sold 15 million units in that period. Based on that track record, the fact that Nintendo is forecasting a 15 million unit number gives us confidence that they will be able to ramp up supply and navigate tariff challenges.</em></p>
<p>The long-term forecast hasn't changed. DFC Intelligence still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecasts</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell as many as a hundred million units by the end of 2029, which would make it by far the leader in the console market for this generation. They also still believe Nintendo is trying to become more of a primary partner for third-party publishers, in contrast to its previous positioning as a separate player from Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.</p>

<p>When it comes to the overall industry, both the Nintendo Switch 2 and GTA VI from next year should help set new hardware and software sales records between 2026 and 2029, as seen in the chart above.</p>
