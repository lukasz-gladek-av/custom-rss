			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> was arguably one of the biggest surprises out of The Game Awards 2024. There was no prior rumor that CAPCOM would revive a long-dead franchise whose latest installment launched nearly twenty years ago. Still, fans of the action/adventure franchise were definitely elated, especially after learning that they wouldn't have to wait too long, given the 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Japanese publication Famitsu recently <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/37453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Game Director Satoru Nihei, who shared several details on the game's structure and length. The Producer said:</p>
<p><em>I want to make it a satisfying volume for a single action game. It's not a game where you defeat the same boss over and over like "Monster Hunter," so I think it will take about 20 hours to complete. It hasn't been decided yet, though. Basically, the story progresses as you clear stages. It's not an open world.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Kadowaki said that while the timeline won't change, the location may change, although it will still be mainly focused on Kyoto in the early Edo period (seventeenth century). Regarding difficulty, the two suggested Onimusha: Way of the Sword won't be a super challenging game:</p>
<p><em><strong>Satoru Nihei — </strong>We want a wide range of action game fans to enjoy the game, so we are proceeding with a policy of not making it extremely difficult. However, if the bosses are easily defeated, it will be boring, so we are continuing to make adjustments every day.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Akihito Kadowaki</strong> <strong>— </strong>Having a difficulty setting hasn't been decided yet. I'll say it again, but I want action fans to enjoy the game to the fullest, so I don't want to make it too difficult, and I want to pursue the appeal of being able to feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat it.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two stated that the setting has been completely reimagined, including the Oni and Genma clans. As such, there's essentially no direct connection to the previous installments, which also helps introduce newcomers to Onimusha: Way of the Sword.</p>

			<p>This morning, CAPCOM announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has now surpassed the milestone of 10 million units sold across all platforms. This is a new first-month sales record for the publisher, making it a historic occurrence.</p>
<p>The achievement is, however, not at all surprising after the incredible success enjoyed by Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, which have reached 21.30 million units and 16.70 million units, respectively, and occupy the first and second positions in the Japanese publisher's all-time sales chart. Monster Hunter Wilds seems poised to surpass them both in relatively short order, especially considering that CAPCOM has a lot of plans to continue updating the game. The first free update will go live this Friday, adding the new monster Mizutsune, which can be hunted starting at Hunter Rank 21. At Hunter level 41 and above, Tempered Mizutsune will also appear in the environment overview.</p>
<p>Arena Quests, Challenge Quests, and Free Challenge Quests will also be introduced in Title Update 1. Challenge Quests and the newly introduced Free Challenge Quests will only appear as temporary event quests. Arena Quests and Challenge Quests can be completed by up to two players using pre-defined equipment. Meanwhile, Free Challenge Quests have no equipment restrictions and can involve hunting parties of up to four players. All of these quest types can be completed solo, cooperatively in cross-platform online multiplayer, or with the help of support hunters. Replay for faster completion times and earn a spot on the Expedition Record Board for special pendants as rewards. New Event Quests will continue to appear on the Quest Board, offering opportunities to earn special armor, quickly increase your Hunter rank, collect cooking ingredients, and more.</p>
<p>Lastly, the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds update also introduces the Grand Hub to the Monster Hunter Wilds - a massive gathering space for hunters to engage in new ways, such as competing against each other in the Hunter League. Players will unlock the Grand Hub after reaching Hunter Rank 16 by speaking to Tetsuzan in Suja. The entrance to the Grand Hub will also house the Expedition Record Board, which will display the fastest global clear times for the newly added Arena Quests, as well as limited Arena Quest bounties. Each season, the Grand Hub will host a unique celebration. These begin with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance, which runs from 23 April to 7 May. During the festivals, the Grand Hub will change its appearance and the food available, and hunters will be able to obtain limited-time equipment, gestures, pop-up camp decorations, and more.</p>

			<p>In a recent interview with Wall Street Week's David Westin, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on the Bloomberg Television YouTube channel, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed the company's strategy for GTA VI marketing.</p>
<p>So far, we've only had one trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in December 2023</a>. Red Dead Redemption 2 had three trailers scattered over the course of three years, plus a gameplay video and a launch trailer. If this pattern were to be followed, it would inherently mean a delay outside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced Fall 2025 release window</a>. However, Zelnick outlined a different strategy for GTA VI where the marketing will only kick off in earnest when closer to launch, to balance excitement with 'unmet anticipation'.</p>
<p><em>The anticipation for that title (GTA VI) may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property. And I've been around the block a few times and I've been in every</em><br>
<em>entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance.</em></p>
<p><em>We found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement</em><br>
<em>with unmet anticipation. We&nbsp;don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we are trying to do.</em></p>
<p>It sounds a lot like the approach championed by Bethesda with Fallout 4, which was announced and released within six months. Of course, GTA VI was announced a long time ago, but it does seem like we'll get more details and trailers about the game relatively close to launch this time around.</p>
<p>It's not just gamers but also competitors who are waiting to know exactly when the most anticipated entertainment product of all time will debut on the market. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/possibility-of-gta-6-delay-threatens-games-industry-some-companies-are-going-to-tank-if-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by analysts, companies are desperate to guess right if GTA VI will launch this Fall or not, as they will have to try and get out of Rockstar's behemoth to stay afloat. It's certainly no coincidence that the current schedule is nearly wide open, with only Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch in October</a> and Crimson Desert also <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned for the Fall window</a>. Everyone else is waiting to see, just like fans.</p>
