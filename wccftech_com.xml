			<p>Testing on the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started</a> via the BF Labs platform last week, and thanks to YouTube user Tomski, we've already got a 15-minute leaked gameplay video to check out. The first impression isn't exactly great, as this looks too much like Call of Duty's Warzone, according to most fans.  Of course, that may change when they actually get to play it.</p>



<p>One of the defining features of the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode is supposed to be destruction, which has been more or less synonymous with the franchise ever since the release of 2008's Bad Company. Beyond that, the mode retains Battlefield's trademark squad system. Each squad (so far, there's no talk of a solo or even a duo mode) selects its classes before the match, and the chosen class cannot be changed during the match. Players begin with two gadgets from their class and can level up during each match, gaining access to special traits, such as the Assault class being able to equip an armor plate more quickly. Experience is earned by defeating an opposing player or completing missions. Additionally, finding Intel Cases scattered throughout the map will yield experience to the entire squad.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode also features a slight twist on the regular shrinking circle formula, or at least on how it affects players. Whereas most circles slowly damage those players on the outside, allowing for tactics such as sneaking from behind the circle, here the circle will instantly kill every player upon contact, therefore eliminating such strategies.</p>



<p>The rest is fairly standard fare for the genre. Squads will be randomly assigned missions that can provide powerful rewards, but players must always be on the lookout because those rewards will be air-dropped in and could technically be stolen by other squads. </p>



<p>There's no word or even rumor on when the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode will be released. It will likely depend on this testing phase; given that it will miss the main game's launch (slated for October 10) anyway, it doesn't make sense to rush it before it's ready and the players have provided their own feedback. </p>
