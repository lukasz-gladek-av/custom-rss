			<p>The latest<strong> RTX Remix path tracing mod</strong> to be <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-mod/addons/undying-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on ModDB</a> is dedicated to <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong>. The original game, an acclaimed first-person survival horror released by <strong>EA Los Angeles</strong> nearly twenty-five years ago, was made <strong>with the very first iteration of Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>With the power of NVIDIA RTX Remix, modder <strong>Pathtracedparadise</strong> heavily overhauled the visuals. Some of their work includes <strong>replacing more than a thousand of the original game's textures</strong> so far with high-resolution (2048x2048) PBR materials that have been upscaled with additional levels of detail added by running each texture multiple times through various Topaz Gigapixel models and then hand-edited as needed. The PBRFusion model was used to generate the PBR map via ComfyUI.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>this is still just an Alpha release</strong> of Clive Barker's Undying RTX Remix path tracing mod. The modder has so far focused on revamping the first couple of hours, as well as a few sections later in the game. The remainder of the game is playable, as lights were automatically placed throughout by a custom D3D9 renderer, but they are not placed in ideal locations and have not yet been adjusted to look good. Furthermore, there are other issues at the moment:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mirrors still need to be fixed</li>



<li>Portals do not animate</li>



<li>Skyboxes aren't rendering correctly</li>



<li>Only some of the Scrye reveals work </li>
</ul>



<p>If you still want to check out the mod (whose download is around <strong>10.5 GB</strong> at the moment) even at this early stage, you'll have to <strong><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/undying-renewal1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first install the Undying Renewal mod</a></strong>, which adds proper widescreen support with more resolution options (up to 4K), quality of life improvements, controller support, multiplayer support, subtitles support, restores cut content, adds a Vulkan renderer for improved performance, reduces load times, and adds a functional in-game settings menu. </p>



<p>After that mod is installed, extract the files from the "Place contents in Undying System folder" folder to the System folder of your Clive Barker's Undying installation (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System), overriding any existing files. Then, <strong>you must run the game once to ensure the RTX Remix hooks are installed</strong> (you should see a message in the top-left corner of the screen and be able to access the RTX Remix menu by pressing Alt+X). Close the game, then open the System folder location (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System) and create an 'rtx-remix' folder within it. Extract the entire 'Undying RTX Mod' folder into this 'mods' folder. To adjust the Field of View (FOV) value, you'll have to edit it directly in the User.ini file.</p>

			<p>Following the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> show, <strong>Xbox Game Studios</strong> head Craig <strong>Duncan</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-studios-changes-leadership-rares-craig-duncan-steps-into-the-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formerly head of <strong>Rare</strong></a>) was <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Gamesradar</a>, with a particular focus on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fable</strong> reboot</a>, arguably the showcase's centerpiece. The executive called Fable 'mindblowing', sharing his excitement particularly for the <strong>Living Population</strong> feature, which will allow players to interact with the NPCs in many different ways.</p>



<p><em>When I think about Playground and their history with the Forza Horizon franchise, and their desire to take on Fable as a franchise, I think it's really about this relentless pursuit of excellence. We all know what that means in Forza Horizon, we've all seen that franchise get bigger and bigger every year, but what does that mean for Fable? I have played a bunch of the game, I've messed around with the combat and the Living Population, and it's just mind blowing. I'm so excited that we talked about it in the Developer Direct, because it's something that people wouldn't expect.</em></p>



<p><em>There were some really special ideas in the original Fable trilogy, but what I think Playground has done is take some of these ideas and modernized them – my brain pops every time I think about the Living Population, how it works, and what it adds to the overall game; it's an incredible invention, and Fable is going to be an incredible RPG. It will be amazing to see what players do with it, and it'll be massively shareable.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Duncan acknowledged some inconsistencies in Xbox Game Studios' multiplatform releases. For example, at the Xbox Developer Direct, Fable and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/double-fine-productions-kiln-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double Fine's Kiln</a></strong> were announced to launch day-and-date on PlayStation 5 (as well as PC and Xbox), whereas <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a></strong> will launch on PC and Xbox first. Duncan said the goal is to be more consistent in the future, but he also clarified that it may not always be the same, depending on the game and the resources behind it.</p>



<p><em>There's always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. When a strategy changes, maybe you've got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can't. So that's why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we're going to work on that, and we're going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</em></p>



<p><em>But you know, for our game makers, if you're on the Fable team you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team's doing. That's always our goal. It's rarely more complicated than that. It's like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</em></p>



<p>In other Fable news, Playground's Game Director Ralph Fulton <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-lead-confirms-mockumentary-style-is-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the action RPG <strong>will actually feature the mockumentary style</strong> we've seen in previous trailers in the game itself, inspired by the hit show '<strong>The Office</strong>'. We won't have to wait too long to see whether it's a good fit, as the game <strong>now has a Fall 2026 release window</strong>, with more details expected to be shared in the next months.</p>
