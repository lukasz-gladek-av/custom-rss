			<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 are doing a lot to fight cheating on PC, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requirement of Secure Boot</a> and Trusted Platform Module (TDM) 2.0. However, nowadays, cheating is an issue even on consoles. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/interview-we-dont-consider-this-a-port-battlefield-6-dev-on-why-it-built-the-ps5-version-concurrently-with-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Push Square</a>, Ripple Effect Technical Director Christian Buhl said they have partnered with Sony and Microsoft to better detect things like Cronus Zen on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, it's unfortunate that cheating has become a problem within the console space, especially with Cronus Zen machines and everything. So we've partnered with PlayStation and both Microsoft in this regard to kind of do detection. We actually have our own level of macro detection and everything.</em></p>



<p><em>So if players are doing rapid with Javelin on the PC side. That's why we've enabled Secure Boot to help us combat the never-ending cheater problem. And we are aware of the console cheater issue, and we're going to be taking cheating very, very seriously here.</em> <em>And we want to preserve as much of the fair play and competitive integrity that we can, because at the end of the day, we want to ensure that you're having a fair competitive space to play Battlefield 6 in.</em></p>



<p>Cronus Zen not only fools games into believing a player is using the gamepad instead of the mouse and keyboard they've actually connected to their consoles, but it also provides access to game scripts and a script compiler, opening the door to many different types of cheats. Needless to say, this could ruin the experience of many players once Battlefield 6 launches on October 10. Here's hoping the collaboration with Sony and Microsoft turns out to be helpful against cheaters.</p>



<p>Ripple Effect also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-secretly-console-first-turn-off-crossplay-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that console players will be able to turn off cross-play with PC, which remains the platform most likely to be affected by cheats.</p>

			<p>Renowned leaker Tom Henderson shared an interesting tidbit regarding Kratos and the next God of War game in the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFFHG7oPngE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming's weekly podcast</a>. </p>



<p>Henderson was discussing with the others the likelihood that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off</a> would be announced at the next State of Play (rumored to take place before the end of September). The leaker then remarked that Sony Santa Monica is also working on a new mainline entry, adding that Kratos would be equipped with a brand new weapon from ancient Egypt.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There's some weird confusion because there is the Metroidvania game in development and then there's also a new mainline God of War game in development, which is kind of similar in themes. I think that Kratos this time has an Egyptian sword, you know, like the curved Egyptian sword. I can't remember what they are called, but I think like what Prince of Persia's got or whatever.</em></p>



<p>Henderson appears to be referring to the Khopesh, a sickle-shaped sword that evolved in Egypt from battle axes. It would be a new weapon for Kratos, but more to the point, it would indirectly imply a potential Egyptian setting. After all, why would there be an Egyptian sword if that wasn't the case? The Norse duology added fitting weapons like the Leviathan Axe, a weapon historically favored by nordic warriors.</p>



<p>It's not first time that the Egyptian setting has been attached to God of War. Before the release of the 2018 installment, Game Director Cory Barlog said that, after the Norse saga, future games could feature either Egyptian or Mayan mythology. </p>



<p>It's already been three years since the release of Ragnar√∂k. However, if the rumor about the smaller Metroidvania game is correct, chances are the next big main installment is a bit further away. Still, in the meantime, fans have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video adaptation</a> to look forward to. The first season is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start filming in March 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Would you like for Sony Santa Monica to choose Egypt as the next God of War setting?</p>
