			<p><strong>Peter Molyneux</strong>, the original creator of the <strong>Fable</strong> franchise at <strong>Lionhead Studios</strong>, shared his first impressions on the upcoming reboot after watching the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent presentation at the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f-me-this-thing-that-we-created-its-going-to-live-peter-molyneux-cried-watching-xboxs-new-fable-gameplay-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with IGN</a>, Molyneux revealed that <strong>he got emotional</strong> at the idea that the Fable IP, which he and the rest of Lionhead spent so much time on, would return. He also pointed out that <strong>it was a good idea for Playground to reboot the series</strong>, and added that he agreed with the twist of the protagonist's village inhabitants turning to stone at the beginning of the game.</p>



<p><em>When I was watching the Fable trailer, I just felt myself tearing up. I know that I could probably be slaughtered for saying that, but I am someone who cries frequently, and I felt incredibly emotional, and the reason I felt emotional was: F*** me. This thing that we created, it's going to live, it’s going to carry on. This world, which we loved creating so much, and other people loved, has a life.</em></p>



<p><em>And for me, the saddest thing would be to see it diminish, which is one of the reasons I'm really going back to God games. So that was the overall emotion. I thought it was really smart of them to retell Fable 1 rather than have the burden of continuing the Fable story. I loved seeing some of those references. I thought it was super smart to have the kid’s family turn to stone. I thought that was really smart. And so those were all the plus points.</em></p>



<p><strong>He did have a few nitpicks</strong>, though, specifically directed toward the game's supposed "cleanliness":</p>



<p><em>If I was critical, which I think you want me to be, there was a slight antiseptic feel about it. But I mean, they've got months and months to build in that character and almost that dirtiness that you want in the world. I never thought Fable as being clean and all the angles being sharp and defined. It's more chaotic. It's more what Old England probably used to be, which was not straight lines, the place, it's more crinkling, and all the buckle belts on people are ridiculously large, and the boots and the hands ridiculously large because that is part of the character. So there’s a little bit more of that character, which I would probably foolishly and ridiculously ask for.</em></p>



<p>That said, Molyneux confirmed <strong>he absolutely plans to play the game once it comes out</strong>, which is supposedly this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>First, the game designer will have to focus on his own new game, the "God game" <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/masters-of-albion-release-date-22-cans-peter-molyneux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Masters of Albion</a></strong>, due to launch on Steam Early Access in late April. Molyneux called it <strong>the culmination of his life's work</strong>. The first gameplay trailer was released yesterday; you can find it below.</p>

			<p>While <strong>CAPCOM's</strong> <strong>RE Engine</strong> gathered a controversial reputation in the past few years due to the spotty performance of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/"><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2</strong></a></em>, the game engine fares significantly better in more linear games. Among the games that does not suffer from any major performance issues caused by the engine itself is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/"><strong><em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake</strong></a>, but a <strong>recent update</strong> to the PC version has essentially put the game in a <strong>worse condition than it was at launch</strong>.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Updating years old software with new DRM is stupid,"</em> noted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Digital Foundry’s</strong> Alex Battaglia. The tech expert's analysis confirms that on a Ryzen 5 3600/RTX 4070 Super build, the introduction of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Enigma Protector DRM</strong> has gutted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU game throughput by 40%</strong>. While the gap shrinks to 20% in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Village</em> fight due to the AI powering the enemies, which introduces a different bottleneck, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">impact remains constant</strong> in other scenarios.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This isn't an isolated incident for the Japanese publisher. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">C</strong>APCOM has recently made similar moves with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Revelations</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 5</em>, sparking a wave of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">anti-consumer backlash</strong> across the community. As YouTube user @chemeergency put it: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Retroactively implementing new DRM over old DRM is insanely anticonsumer."</em> And it's not doing the publisher any favors, either, as some may be more inclined to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">go with the pirated version</strong> for better performance.</p>



<p>With <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></em> on the horizon, some may wonder if the latest entry will be similarly impacted. However, the game is <strong>confirmed to use Denuvo on PC</strong>, complete with the standard five-activation limit. While <strong>Denuvo</strong> has its own issues, its <strong>impact on performance is lighter</strong> than <em>Enigma Protector</em>. Hopefully, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> will realize that protecting three-year-old games at the cost of the player experience is a losing battle by the time the <strong>ninth entry</strong> in the series requires a DRM update.</p>

			<p>Today, South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has released the third and final <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> overview video. While the previous overviews were focused on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-second-features-overview-combat-depth-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">combat</a>, this time the footage puts the spotlight on the game's non-combat activities.</p>



<p>The heart of the player's journey in Crimson Desert will be <strong>in the Greymane Camp</strong>. After losing their homeland, Paelun, to the Black Bears, the faction established this stretch of land in Hernand as their new base of operations.</p>



<p>Although the camp has humble beginnings, owing to the ragged state of the Greymane band at the beginning of the game, it is designed to evolve. <strong>Players can invest the funds and resources they gather on their travels to upgrade the camp's facilities over time</strong>. It is not just a resting point, either, but also a survival hub. Players can cook meals to maintain health, purchase provisions, and engage in farming and ranching to produce essential resources when the wilds of Pywel are unable to provide them. Cooking was also presented in the video as an essential activity rather than a sideline: <strong>hearty meals cooked at the bonfire provide crucial health, spirit, and stamina buffs</strong>.</p>



<p>Perhaps most intriguing of all is the Companion System. As the camp grows, scattered Greymanes (some actively recruited by the players, others arriving on their own) will join to regroup. <strong>These are not static NPCs, according to the developers; they can be assigned roles or deployed on missions across the continent</strong>. Whether gathering wood and ore or thinning enemy ranks in distant, blockaded regions, <strong>these companions actively contribute to the war effort</strong>, even when the player character is miles away.</p>



<p>The villages and cities of Pywel teem with activity. As well as the usual blacksmiths forging weapons and tailors outfitting players for their travels, these hubs offer a glimpse into the region's daily life. <strong>Residents will offer commissions ranging from delivering goods and tracking missing persons to providing protection against bandits</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We also learn from the overview video that <strong>Crimson Desert features a robust crime system</strong>. Harmful actions against innocents can turn both residents and guards hostile, so layers who choose the life of an outlaw may find themselves forced to fight their way out of towns, pay hefty fines, or even serve time in jail.</p>



<p>We're now exactly one month and one week away from the <strong>March 19</strong> release date. If you're a PC user and are looking to purchase new AMD hardware imminently, you can take advantage of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-amd-game-bundle-announced-free-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert AMD Game Bundle</a></strong>, available at select retailers <strong>through April 25</strong>.</p>
