<p><a href="https://x.com/GoTKingsroad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Via X</a>, the developers shared brief videos of iconic locations such as Castle Black, with its huge ice wall, and Winterfell, the ancestral home of House Stark.</p>

<p>Netmarble also sent over a press release where they showcased new creatures from the lesser known lore of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Players will get to fight these creatures in boss encounters available in the cooperative multiplayer mode Altar of Memories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ice Spiders</strong> - Described as "as big as hounds", these nightmarish creatures are said to have been ridden by the White Walkers as they swept through the Seven Kingdoms. They can be found nesting in caves, where they crawl along ceilings, spitting webs and powerful venom.</li>
<li><strong>Stormhorn Unicorns</strong> - These rare goat-like creatures live on the island of Skagos and herald thunder and lightning. They use their fearsome horn and enormous size to dominate in battle.</li>
<li><strong>Ironbeak Griffins</strong> - These majestic creatures are said to have once lived in the valleys of the Westerlands, nesting in abandoned mines in search of prey.</li>
<li><strong>Red Cockatrice</strong> - With a dragon-like body and a rooster's head, these mythical creatures are as grotesque as they are deadly. Their razor-sharp beaks and claws make quick work of those unfortunate enough to come across them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The footage also briefly shows a fight against 'Field Boss Drogon', which should be a reference to Daenerys's black dragon.</p>

<p>In the game, players will experience an original story as they take on the role of a new character who, through a twist of fate, becomes the heir to House Tyre, a small noble house in Northern Westeros. In addition to customizing their character with a robust character creator, players will be able to choose from one of three classes - Sellsword, Knight, or Assassin - inspired by the cornerstone roles in the original series.</p>
<p>Netmarble teased that more details on the release date of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be released soon.</p>
