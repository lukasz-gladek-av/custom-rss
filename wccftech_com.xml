			<p>Warner Bros. Games has <a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/2001336625847243153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Hogwarts Legacy has now surpassed <strong>40 million units</strong> across all the platforms it's available on (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S and X, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2). It is unclear whether they are counting the free redemptions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store's promotion</a> (which ends in a few hours, so hurry if you're interested in adding the game to your library). We've asked WB Games and will update this post if they respond.</p>



<p>Avalanche Software's open world action/adventure game set in the Wizarding World launched in February 2023 to very positive critical and fan <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a>, despite a call to boycott it due to Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling's (who had no direct involvement with the game) views on transgender people.</p>



<p>It didn't take long for Hogwarts Legacy to start breaking sales records:</p>



<ul>
<li>Just a couple of weeks after launch, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-works-magic-for-warner-bros-biggest-launch-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that it became the <strong>best-selling launch ever in the publisher's history</strong>;</li>



<li>By May 2023, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-earned-over-1-billion-in-retail-sold-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> over 15 million units and earned <strong>more than one billion dollars</strong> at retail alone;</li>



<li>By January 2024, WB Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Hogwarts Legacy had surpassed 22 million units and established itself as the <strong>best-selling game of 2023</strong> in a year full of triple-A releases;</li>



<li>Later that month, the publisher could <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-24-million-units-new-features-and-ex-playstation-exclusive-content-coming-in-q3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirm</a> a new sales milestone, 24 million units, while also announcing new features coming with patches and also that previously exclusive PlayStation content would be available elsewhere, too;</li>



<li>By November 2024, Hogwarts Legacy had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the threshold of 30 million units</a>, and the publisher predictably confirmed that a sequel was their biggest priority.</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier in 2024, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a Definitive Edition was in the works with the help of Rocksteady (Batman: Arkham trilogy, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League). The goal <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was to add between 10 and 15 hours of new content</a>, but eventually, the publisher worried that the amount of new stuff wouldn't be enough to justify their estimated asking price of $30 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled this edition</a>.</p>



<p>Still, Hogwarts Legacy 2 is absolutely coming, and based on rumors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's not going to be a game-as-a-service</a>, even though Warner Bros. execs previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it very clear</a> that they were looking to transfer this level of success to an ongoing live service game. That's likely going to be a separate project.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that even with the outstanding sales performance of Avalanche Software's game, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to shut down several studios</a> (Monolith Productions, Player First Games, San Diego Studio) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructure around its four key franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones). Ultimately, everything will be up to the winning company in the bidding war between <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Skydance</a>, with the former already <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making it clear that WB Games is just a nice bonus</a>, as far as they're concerned, in the megadeal.</p>
