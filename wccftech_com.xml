			<p>Exciting as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct was last week, even as it ended on a high note with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-donkey-kong-bananza-gameplay-shows-how-its-more-than-just-a-dk-version-of-super-mario-odyssey/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, fans remained cautiously enthusiastic. We all recognized that Nintendo had left out the price of everything from the direct.</p>
<p>There was no price for the Nintendo Switch 2 or the games, which made even more sense when we found out, shortly after the direct was over, how expensive the Switch 2 was and how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like Mario Kart World would be jumping up to $80 USD</a>.</p>
<p>But before we even get into how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">tariffs</a> could further change the pricing of the hardware and the games, Nintendo feels that Mario Kart World and every other Nintendo Switch 2 game that will cost $80 are worth that price point.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">IGN</a>, Nintendo of America vice president of product and player experience Bill Trinen discussed how Nintendo arrived at its new pricing structure and was adamant that Mario Kart World, the Nintendo Switch 2, and everything else that Nintendo reveals that now costs more are justified in that price.</p>
<p>"<em>I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, [...] I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out."</em></p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had."</em></p>
<p>Trinen's answer about the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom being $80, or the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Party Jamboree also being $80, followed the same line of thinking.</p>
<p>"<em>Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?'"</em></p>
<p>"<em>[...] I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that."</em></p>
<p>As a senior executive at Nintendo, Trinen is expected to defend the price hikes. Ultimately, everyone buying or not buying a Nintendo Switch 2 and any of the exclusive games for it will make that judgment for themselves.</p>
<p>And who knows, Trinen could end up being right in many players' eyes. We'll have to see how the upcoming Mario Kart World Direct fares with fans and if what's revealed there really showcases why it is worth the $80 price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumors-of-a-fornite-movie-in-the-works-are-false-according-to-epic-games-boss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chief executive officer and head of Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-tim-sweeney-says-apple-and-google-run-gangster-style-businesses/">Tim Sweeney</a> has taken to X to shut down rumors about an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2-goes-live-bringing-back-tilted-towers/">Fortnite</a> movie.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/epic-games-boss-shuts-down-fortnite-movie-rumours-1525313/">GameReactor</a>, film insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK">DanielRPK</a> claimed that the idea of a Fortnite film had been floating around Hollywood but was unable to find a studio willing to take it on to start actually developing it. Which isn't all that surprising to hear if that was the case.</p>
<p>Fortnite is incredibly popular, but not for any narrative through-line. Epic has been able to keep going since its inception. Also, the inclusion of pretty much every character from the majority of the current popular intellectual properties across genres would make the film a logistical nightmare, should any proposed Fortnite film try to capture that aspect of the game.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the recent box office success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">Minecraft movie</a> had DanielRPK speculating that studios would change their tune. Minecraft has about the same amount of narrative to it that Fortnite does, and even though it's been critically panned, the power kids have over their parents' spending money remains undefeated.</p>
<p><span>Families continue to flock to the theater to see it, though a now-viral&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/ollie_twt/status/1908414804823543938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'chicken jockey'</a> moment suggests that those same parents ought to bring earplugs with them to the theater if they want to keep the use of their ears after they walk out. </span>Regardless, it doesn't seem like that's a rabbit hole worth jumping down, as Sweeney simply replied to DanielRPK's claims with the word <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632">"<em>false</em>."</a> DanielRPK later deleted his post.</p>
<p>Sweeney's dismissal of DanielRPK's claims does seem to end the conversation right there, but his one-word reply also leaves a bit of ambiguity as to what he's dismissing. Is he dismissing that a Fortnite movie was ever being shopped around? Is he dismissing that the movie was being reconsidered after the success of the Minecraft film? Is he dismissing all of DanielRPK's claims because a Fortnite movie is already in development and is entirely separate from DanielRPK's speculation?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps the simplest answer, he's just dismissing all of the above, and there is no Fortnite movie. Which, again, is not an unreasonable thing to suspect, because of how difficult it would be to navigate making that movie. Even in today's renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations (with a new box office record <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just broken</a> by A Minecraft Movie), there remain plenty of games that would simply not translate to the silver or small screen in a way that anyone would want. Including some of gaming's biggest franchises, like Fortnite.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Easiest Upscaling Option to Use Will Be NVIDIA DLSS, but Other Software Solutions Will Be Supported; Joy-Con 2 Mouse Functionality M]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-nvidia-dlss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-option-to-use-will-be-nvidia-dlss-but-other-software-solutions-will-be-supported-joy-con-2-mouse-functionality-m.1157238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-nvidia-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support NVIDIA DLSS, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, but the AI-powered upscaler won't be the only option available, nor will it be mandatory to use upscaling in any way.</p>
<p>Speaking with<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-developers-discuss-the-consoles-tech-and-iwatas-lasting-legacy-on-its-development"> IGN</a>, Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department's Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta and Technology Development Division's Tetsuya Sasaki talked about upscaling options for the new system, revealing that, while NVIDIA DLSS will be the "easiest" upscaling option to use in games, the company is planning on providing other software-based upscaling solutions. In addition, the Nintendo representatives highlighted how not using any upscaling solution is also an option. Considering how using DLSS has a cost, we are likely going to use a wide variety of upscaling solutions to hit whichever frame rate targets developers aim for in their games.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will also support ray tracing, but much like NVIDIA DLSS and other upscaling solutions, developers won't be required to implement it in their games, as Nintendo considers ray tracing just another tool that can either be used or not depending on the situation. Considering how demanding ray tracing can get and how the console won't be the most powerful gaming system around, this isn't particularly surprising.</p>
<p>Besides supporting NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing, one feature that sets the Nintendo Switch 2 apart from its predecessor is the mouse functionality of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Speaking with<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen"> IGN</a>, Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen commented on the new functionality, saying how, having been added on top of the other unique features of the Joy-Con 2 controllers, it is different from that of a regular PC mouse, opening up some interesting possibilities like using dual mouse controls that he hopes third-party developers will take advantage of to evolve their gameplay. He also hopes that having this control option will make PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to the console, as they wouldn't have to revamp control schemes.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5th. You can learn more about the system by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on preview.</a></p>
