			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/">announced the return</a> of its <strong>Xbox Developer Direct</strong> event on <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, which so far looks to be a Playground Games-focused event with a look at both Forza Horizon 6 and Fable, though tagging along and not to be outdone is Pokémon developer <strong>Game Freak</strong>, which will be showcasing its upcoming non-Pokémon game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">Beast of Reincarnation</a>.</p>



<p>That's what we know will be there, but there will likely be more shown at the event; every year that Xbox has hosted its Developer Direct to start off the new year, it has led with a few titles that it confirms will be shown ahead of time, and held back one or two surprises to be revealed at the show. </p>



<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/">2025's Developer Direct,</a> for example, announced that we'd get a look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> ahead of the show. The surprise was the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2: Black</a>, to round out the show.</p>



<p>As for what we know Xbox will show at the event, according to the Xbox Wire blog post, we'll get to see gameplay for all three of the aforementioned titles, with the Forza Horizon 6 segment being "<em>a deep-dive</em>" on the coming racer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What's more interesting to note, however, is that Xbox Developer Direct events have a history of revealing release dates for the games shown. It's not a surefire thing, of course, but if Xbox keeps that tradition for this year, then we can expect release dates for Fable, Forza Horizon 6, and Beast of Reincarnation.</p>



<p>We could have anticipated a release date for Forza Horizon 6, as we've known that <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">it is targeting a first-half of 2026 release window</a>. Beast of Reincarnation is a surprise and a bit of a wildcard, since we don't know too much about the upcoming action RPG from Game Freak, who seem to be stepping far outside their comfort zone by making something totally separate from the most well-known franchise in the world.</p>



<p>Fable is the most intriguing of the bunch to get a release date for. The last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-technical-issues-ps5-2026/">after it was delayed out of 2025 and into 2026</a>, was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/">it might not even hit its proposed 2026 release window</a>. Hopefully, its presence at the Developer Direct means we will get a release date and that the game's development isn't as troubled as it has seemed from the outside looking in. </p>



<p>Beyond that, who knows what will be shown at the event. We could get another look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-2026-the-year-of-xbox-studios/">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, or something that's not yet on anyone's radar. This year is Xbox's 25th anniversary year, so we ought to expect Team Green to go all-out right from the beginning. We'll find out when the show premieres on <strong>January 22, 2026, at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT</strong>.</p>

			<p>2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2025-weird-and-wondrous-tales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a great year for adventure games</a>, but this year is <strong>perhaps even more promising when looking at the schedule</strong>. Some of the most talented developers in the genre are returning with innovative games that will offer a staggering amount of variety in gameplay experiences for those who prefer not to engage in action-focused games.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, all of them come from independent developers who correctly identified the genre as a niche that most triple-A developers are content to leave alone. There's also a strong presence of French-made titles. Without further ado, here's our shortlist for the <strong>most anticipated adventure games scheduled in 2026</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-cairn-january-29-2026-pc-playstation-5">Cairn (January 29, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<p>French independent developer <strong>The Game Bakers</strong> returns after 2016's bossfight action game <strong>Furi</strong> and 2020's love-themed RPG <strong>Haven</strong>. Both of those were quite unique and garnered acclaim, although they did not achieve the same level of popularity as other indie titles. The upcoming <strong>Cairn</strong> might just pull that off, though, especially on the heels of <strong>Peak</strong> being one of the most successful games of 2025 with <strong>over 10 million units</strong> sold to date. </p>



<p>Suddenly, climbing games look a lot more appealing to many gamers. In this one, professional climber Aava stands at the base of Mount Kami and must reach its peak.​ The gameplay prioritizes realistic climbing simulation over cinematic spectacle. Piton placement, rope management, oxygen depletion, and falling mechanics create genuine survival stakes. There's even a riskier, optional Free Solo mode that cuts safety systems for particularly daring players.</p>



<p>The 15-hour campaign features approximately an hour of cinematic storytelling, voiced by a cast of 10 climbers, each representing psychological archetypes drawn to vertical terrain. Mathieu Bablet, the celebrated comic artist, directs visual language, while the sound design comes from the team behind Limbo, Inside, and Control.​</p>



<p>The Cairn Steam demo received extremely positive feedback, and with <strong>over 700K wishlists</strong> already secured, the game is not only the first title on this adventure games list to launch, it's also among the most likely to be successful.</p>

<h2 id="h-tides-of-tomorrow-february-24-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Tides of Tomorrow (February 24, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS, XSX)</h2>



<p><strong>Tides of Tomorrow</strong> is another adventure game that comes from an indie studio based in France, more specifically in Montpellier: <strong>DigixArt</strong>. Founded by the creator of <strong>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</strong>, the studio has since released a rhythm game, <strong>Lost in Harmony</strong>, and three adventure games, <strong>11-11: Memories Retold</strong>, <strong>Road 96</strong>, and <strong>Road 96: Mile 0</strong>. This new game is quite different, to say the least, and incredibly ambitious.</p>



<p>Firstly, it operates in a permanent asynchronous multiplayer narrative-focused mode. Where most online games pursue real-time synchronization, Tides of Tomorrow focuses on the inverse: a cascade of choices where <strong>your decisions reshape another player's story, and theirs reshape yours</strong>. The asynchronous vision system works like this: you select another player to follow—a friend, a streamer, or even a stranger, and begin your journey in locations they previously visited. NPCs retain memories of their actions; they speak about decisions made by the prior player. Ghost echoes of their movements appear as visual guides helping you anticipate environmental hazards. But here's the crux: when you steal from an NPC the previous player befriended, that NPC's attitude shifts permanently for all future players who follow you.</p>



<p>This ties into the environmental narrative, where Plastemia's spread (the conversion of life into plastic) mirrors the ripple effects of player decisions propagating through asynchronous time. <strong>Each player inherits a wounded world shaped by predecessors</strong>; each player wounds it further for successors.​</p>



<p>The developers promise that <strong>the game's branching storylines will respond to the cumulative moral weight</strong>. Story sections can even drastically change based on the prior player's set of choices. Multiple endings, therefore, emerge from whether you preserved or sacrificed NPCs, resources, or your own sanity.  Needless to say, Tides of Tomorrow sounds like a game that will either reinvent the genre or be a total flop. Of course, we're crossing our fingers for the former outcome.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cthulhu-The-Cosmic-Abyss_2025_03-06-25_006-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-april-16-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss (April 16, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS, XSX)</h2>



<p>The third entry in our adventure games list for 2026 is also the third project that originates from a French developer. They certainly like this genre, don't they? This time, it's <strong>Big Bad Wolf</strong>, the studio behind 2018's episodic mystery adventure game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-council-episode-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Council</a></strong> and 2022's roleplaying game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-vampires-make-for-excellent-investigators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong</a></strong>. </p>



<p>After VtM, they're moving to an even creepier setting: <strong>Lovecraft</strong>. In <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-styx-and-cthulhu-announcements-headline-nacon-connect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a></strong>, <span>however, they're bringing Lovecraft's cosmic horror forward to the year&nbsp;<strong>2053</strong>, when Earth's surface has been nearly strip-mined and desperate corporations tunnel beneath the Pacific in search of</span> rare minerals. When one mining station goes silent, <strong>Noah</strong>, an <strong>Ancile</strong> investigator (an occult division of <strong>Interpol</strong>), descends into <strong>R'lyeh</strong>, the sunken city that the miners unwittingly awakened.</p>



<p>As in classic Lovecraft, <strong>the city's architecture violates Euclidean geometry</strong>, with angles that shouldn't work and paths that loop back on themselves. Corridors will feel simultaneously monumental and claustrophobic, ancient yet pulsating with malevolent consciousness. The city isn't just alien; <strong>it's aware and deeply hostile to Noah's presence</strong>.</p>



<p>There's a perfectly fitting <strong>sanity mechanic</strong>, although in this game, sanity degrades constantly merely by witnessing cosmic wrongness, such as impossible geometry, terrifying audio cues, and distortions that suggest reality itself is warped at R'lyeh's depths. Unlike other horror games where sanity can be restored, <strong>this will be a one-way descent</strong>, and the only choice presented to players is whether to ignore the mysteries to preserve sanity or sacrifice mental stability to uncover the truth. The player's final sanity state at the narrative climax determines which of multiple endings they're going to receive.</p>



<p>NPCs embody the <strong>golden Lovecraftian principle</strong>: true horror resists definition. The player rarely sees the Shoggoth directly. Instead, they'll catch glimpses: shadows, distortions, echoes of something passing nearby, thus increasing the tension already heightened by the first-person view.</p>

<h2 id="h-order-of-the-sinking-star-tba-2026-pc">Order of the Sinking Star (TBA 2026 - PC)</h2>



<p><strong>Jonathan Blow</strong>, the acclaimed game designer behind indie gems like <strong>Braid</strong> and <strong>The Witness</strong>, returns ten years after his latest project with <strong>Order of the Sinking Star</strong>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/braid-the-witness-developer-thekla-announce-order-of-the-sinking-star-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced less than a month ago</a> during The Game Awards 2025, this innovative puzzle adventure game is set in a realm filled with magic, monsters, and curious traps. </p>



<p>During this adventure, players will explore <strong>four different worlds</strong>, each with its own rules, characters, secrets, and dangers. Some of the playable characters include <strong>a queen, a thief, a warrior, a wizard, a bard, a druid, and a priestess</strong>, each with their own abilities and skills. For example, the warrior can push blocks forward without restrictions, whereas the thief cannot push anything; objects act as walls to her. On the other hand, pulling is compulsive and automatic for this character. If she moves backwards while adjacent to an object, she must grab it. The wizard's core ability, teleportation, is also involuntary: if a swappable object exists within range in his direction of movement, he must swap positions with it. ​ The Wizard can also generate multiple clones by entering different mirrors, creating simultaneous multi-position puzzle solutions. </p>



<p>It is through the combination of the characters' skills that the player can solve the puzzles featured in this game. And there's going to be a ton of them: Blow revealed there will be <strong>over a thousand handcrafted puzzles</strong>, for an estimated <strong>250-500 hours of gameplay</strong>, depending on your puzzle-solving expertise. If you're into this kind of challenge, Order of the Sinking Star looks like a must-have.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9163b5_f44c02152b5e4cf1b8fa9bb4fd800af4mv2.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-into-the-fire-tba-2026-pc">Into the Fire (TBA 2026 - PC)</h2>



<p>The last pick in our 2026 adventure games shortlist is <strong>Into the Fire</strong>, the next project by Polish developer <strong>Starward Industries</strong>, which made 2023's sci-fi game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-invincible-exploring-the-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Invincible</a></strong>, based on a novel by Stanisław Lem. </p>



<p>Into the Fire was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/dantes-ring-is-a-so-called-anti-combat-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-the-invincible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in late 2024</a> as an <strong>'anti-combat' game</strong> called <strong>Dante's Ring</strong>. Although the title has changed, the setting remains the same. You're a desperate explorer fighting a volcanic apocalypse on <strong>Dante's Archipelago</strong> and must <strong>rescue as many lives as possible</strong>, including yourself, before <strong>extracting from the danger zone</strong>. The game does incorporate some elements from extraction games, although it is single player-only. Whereas in traditional extraction games, you fight off other players and try to extract with new loot, here the main dilemma is: <strong>do you save one more survivor, knowing it risks your extraction</strong>? </p>



<p>You'll be able to discover the stories of those you saved and <strong>help locals by completing their quests</strong>. In the hub, which you'll return to between extraction, you'll get to <strong>craft and upgrade gear, thus customizing the playstyle, and even tend to rescued plants and animals</strong>.</p>



<p>Fire will be both a threat and a tool in this adventure. Expect to have to survive <strong>pyroclastic flows (superheated gas), volcanic bombs (ejecta projectiles), structural collapses, ash storms</strong>, and more. ​Just like in The Invincible, Starward Industries maintains a <strong>retro-aesthetic design</strong>. Here, it's a 1950s-inspired "golden age of scientific ambition" that collides with an apocalyptic reality. </p>



<p>Into the Fire will debut on early access first, though the developer reckons <strong>the full game will still launch in 2026</strong>, making it eligible for this list.</p>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>Beyond those five adventure games, there's plenty more that should rightfully catch your attention, including the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror—Reforged</strong></li>



<li><strong>Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mixtape</strong></li>

            <title><![CDATA[Mario Tennis Fever Will Feature the Most Playable Characters in Series History, “Most Jam-Packed Mario Tennis Yet”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer-nintendo/</link>
            <guid>1400548</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has debuted a new overview trailer for <strong>Mario Tennis Fever</strong>, the upcoming entry in the Mario Tennis series that Nintendo is calling the "<em>most jam-packed Mario Tennis yet</em>," and it's not just saying that. By playable characters alone, Mario Tennis Fever is the biggest game in the series' history as it'll feature a total of <strong>38 characters at launch</strong>.</p>



<p>The overview trailer showcased the new features being introduced in Mario Tennis Fever, chief among them being Fever Rackets. These are different kinds of rackets that you unlock in a match by keeping a rally going, and when you get the chance to use one, you can disadvantage your opponent by making their side of the court a sheet of ice, covering it with flames, electrocutting them; there's a whole swath of elemental damage and obstacles you can place in their path with a well-placed Fever Racket shot.</p>



<p>On top of the 38 playable characters, there are <strong>30 different kinds of Fever Rackets</strong>, each with their own special abilities and methods of changing the style of the match and making it as chaotic as possible.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Perhaps more intriguing than the Fever Rackets are all the different game modes. Firstly, there's a much-appreciated classic mode that does away with Fever Rackets and brings the gameplay back to plain old tennis. If you don't want to lose a match because your character was on fire and couldn't return a shot, classic mode puts everything back on a more even playing field.</p>



<p>On the other side of that, there are several modes that make things even more chaotic than they already are with Fever Rackets, and pull inspiration from other Mario games, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>-inspired mode that changes the court in surprising ways when you aim for Wonder Flowers.</p>



<p>There's also an adventure mode that will take you through all the basics before you jump into playing multiplayer, either in casual matches online or in ranked matches. You'll also be able to change how you play by taking the Joy-Con 2 controller off the side of your Nintendo Switch 2 and play Mario Tennis Fever like you would if it were a Nintendo Wii game, swinging your controller as the racket.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Fever will be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive title when it launches next month on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">February 12, 2026.</a></strong> It was one of our picks for our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-racing-games-of-2026-from-japan-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">most anticipated sports and racing games of 2026</a>, and today's new overview trailer only validated that choice.  </p>
