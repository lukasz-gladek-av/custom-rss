			<p>2025 is going to see a lot of massive releases across a multitude of genres. Narrowing it down to the sports and racing games in particular, there are a fair few games that are going to be released this year that will be major hits for petrolheads and sports fans. If you want to know what games you should be putting on your calendar this year, make sure to keep reading for Wccftech's most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025.</p>

<h2>Assetto Corsa EVO (Out Now on PC via Steam)</h2>
<p>Assetto Corsa is a very popular racing game franchise, and the latest iteration has just been released, albeit on early access. There isn't a date set yet for when Assetto Corsa EVO is going to be on consoles just yet, so those on console will have to wait a little bit longer for this hyperrealistic racing game. What we do know is that Assetto Corsa EVO is set to have its full launch between September and December. The game will feature extensive modding support, as well as consistent updates to keep the game fresh once it has experienced its full launch, when it will include 100 cars and 15 officially licensed circuits (with 5 more tracks following afterward as free updates). Before that, KUNOS <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will add an open world map sometime this Summer</a>.</p>
<p>If you jump in right now, though, you'll already find 20 cars from several classes and 5 circuits across the continents: Laguna Seca (America), Brands Hatch and Imola (Europe), Mount Panorama (Australia), and Suzuka (Japan). When it comes to modes, the early access launch build features Practice sessions, Quick Races, the brand new Driving Academy, and the Hotstint and Test Drive special events.</p>

<h2>WWE 2K25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>WWE is a popular franchise that helps boost profits for both Take-Two Interactive. This game was mentioned during the earnings call, where they mentioned both the potential release of PGA Tour 2K25 and, of course, WWE 2K25. Since 2000, WWE has received a new game every year except for 2021, where there was no game released at all. Since then, it's gone back to regular scheduling, and it's likely that WWE 2K25 will be released this year. It doesn't have a set release date as of yet, but it was mentioned in the earnings call that the game will be released before March 31, 2025. This would make sense, as the past three WWE games (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-improved WWE 2K24</a>) were all released in early March.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>iRacing NASCAR 25 (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>It's been a long time coming, but NASCAR fans are finally getting a new game in the franchise. It's been three years since the last iteration aside from NASCAR 21: Ignition, but most people don't count that as an actual game in the series. iRacing NASCAR 25 was first heard of in 2023, when iRacing purchased the NASCAR license from Motorsport Games. This game will be built in Unreal Engine alongside Monster Games and is currently planned to launch on consoles, while a PC release is still up in the air.</p>

<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (TBA - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>This game was first showcased at The Game Awards 2024, where Sega released a trailer for this upcoming game. The release date is currently unknown, but it is set to debut "soon." All we know is that the developers have promised a distinct racing mechanic that will 'transport Sonic racing fans into a new dimension.'</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be available across all platforms (including Nintendo's) and, like its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/team-sonic-racing-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Sonic Racing</a>, could be the perfect game to get youngsters into gaming and engage in some friendly competition.</p>

<h2>Wreckfest 2 (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole sports and racing games genre, there isn't anything quite like Wreckfest. The spiritual successor to FlatOut <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-announced-with-new-car-customization-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returns in 2025</a> after 2018's first installment. We don't know a lot about it yet, although Finnish developer Bugbear Entertainment has promised improved destruction thanks to the more accurate physics engine and better sounds, with the latter being boasted as among the best in a racing title. So far, the main new feature is the ability to customize your vehicle. More info will undoubtedly be shared ahead of the launch.</p>

			<p>The extremely popular collectible card game Marvel Snap suddenly became inaccessible to United States users <a href="https://wccftech.com/tiktok-officially-banned-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the TikTok ban</a> due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). Here's the message that greets anyone who tries to log in (also available <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social channels</a>):</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable on U.S. stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, MARVEL SNAP was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18th.</em></p>
<p><em>MARVEL SNAP isn't going anywhere. We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.</em></p>
<p>The reason is pretty straightforward: TikTok creator ByteDance owns Nuverse, the publisher of the game. All apps owned by ByteDance were banned, including Marvel Snap. However, since the game itself isn't related to TikTok at all, there may be enough wiggle room for them to restore service.</p>
<p>Developed by Second Dinner, the free-to-play game launched in October 2022 for Windows PC, Android, and iOS devices. It featured over 170 Marvel characters on release, and the roster has greatly increased over time due to weekly additions.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Marvel Snap isn't too complicated. Each player has a deck of 12 cards, each one representing a Marvel character with a cost, power level, and possibly a special ability. At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously place one or more cards face down in one of three locations. The locations are randomly assigned for each game, and each location has a unique associated effect. At the end of each round, the cards are revealed and their special abilities are triggered. Whoever has the highest power in a given location wins that location; the goal is to win two of the three locations.</p>
<p>Its relative simplicity won over many fans. Last we heard, Marvel Snap had over 22 million players and has earned more than $200 million in revenue since launch.</p>
