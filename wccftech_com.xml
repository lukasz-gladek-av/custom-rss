			<p>Battlefield REDSEC, the new battle royale mode from EA and Battlefield Studios to go along with what has been a stellar return for the series with Battlefield 6, in many ways, is like every other battle royale you've already played.</p>



<p>You jump out of a plane and onto a massive map that continuously shrinks, and you have to immediately find a weapon, build your loadout, and do whatever you can to survive and be the last squad/person standing.</p>



<p>You should always be looking for a way to get an edge over the rest of the lobby, to give yourself the best chance at success. Part of that is having the right loadout for victory, which you could actually prepare ahead of time and acquire while on the battlefield of Fort Lyndon.</p>



<p>That said, getting your custom loadout while in the middle of a match isn't the same as it is in other battle royale titles. This guide will show you what you need to do to get your custom loadout and weapons in a game of Battlefield REDSEC.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-guide-how-to-get-your-custom-loadout">Battlefield REDSEC Guide - How to Get Your Custom Loadout</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Custom weapon drops in Battlefield REDSEC are very common, and your best path to getting a custom loadout.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: you have to set up your loadout in the menu before you jump into a match. You do this by selecting the weapons you use for your loadout as one of your 'Favorite' weapons and by selecting the loadout you want to use as a 'Favorite.' </p>



<p>Once you're set up and ready to go, there are two ways to get a custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC: </p>



<ol>
<li>Complete missions that reward you with a custom loadout</li>



<li>Track down custom weapon drops and piece-meal your loadout from there</li>
</ol>



<p>Completing missions that grant custom loadout rewards is a potential avenue for getting your custom loadout in Battlefield REDSEC, but it's not necessarily one to rely on. It's not the most common reward, and while you could get lucky and see it happen in multiple back-to-back matches, that's not guaranteed.</p>



<p>Custom Weapon Drops, however, happen in random places on the map each round, and you can trust you'll be able to run over to one in each match. Once you find one, you'll be able to select one weapon per drop, which means you'll have to try and reach multiple drops to put together a full custom loadout.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll only be able to select the weapons you listed as your 'Favorites' when you grab a custom weapon drop.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Still, it's the most reliable way to get your custom weapons into Battlefield REDSEC.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history.1354270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/football-manager-2026-is-the-series">The Game Business</a> once again reveals the latest GSD sales data, and which games made the top-10 on Europe's sales charts for last week (November 2-9). While previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-back-in-top-spot-eu-sales-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-drops-to-third/">weeks have been dominated by Battlefield 6</a>, last week's sales tell a different story, with Football Manager 26 roaring into the top spot to knock Battlefield off, at least for a week.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-has-been-canceled-to-focus-on-next-installment/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled</a>, it was even more critical for SEGA and Sports Interactive that Football Manager 26 was a success, and so far, at least commercially, that's been the case. According to The Game Business, not only is this a big release for the Football Manager series, it's the biggest launch in the history of GSD releasing these weekly sales charts, a practice it started back in 2017.</p>



<p>That said, for all its commercial success, Football Manager 26 has not gone over well with players, with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/">player reviews categorized as 'Mostly Negative' on the game's Steam page</a>. Still, those negative reviews today won't change the fact that, at least for a week, Football Manager 26 sits at the top of the EU's sales charts in both units sold and revenue.</p>



<p>Despite being toppled, Battlefield 6 did not fall too far down the list, remaining in the top three at the number two spot for both revenue and units sold. It's followed by EA Sports FC 26, which has also been one of the leading titles in recent weeks, followed by Pokémon Legends Z-A and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment in fourth and fifth place, respectively, on the units sold chart. On the revenue chart, they swap places, with Pokémon in fifth place and Hyrule Warriors in fourth.</p>



<p>Other notable entries in the top-10 lists include Ghost of Yotei, which came in at the eighth spot for units sold and the sixth spot for revenue, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which made the units sold list in ninth place and the revenue list in seventh. </p>



<p>While Ghost of Yotei continues to ride the wave of its first month and a half on the market, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 re-enters the charts <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">thanks to a mixture of a free trial weekend where players on Steam and Xbox could try the game for free</a>, and get the game at a discounted price with all of their progress made in the free trial carrying over. The free weekend and discount were also timed with the release of the game's third and final DLC expansion, which drew even more players back to it after it launched at the start of this year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-10 games in the EU for units sold for last week (November 2-9):</p>



<ol>
<li>Football Manager 26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">AdHoc Studio's debut project, Dispatch,</a> has become one of 2025's late entries into the game of the year conversation based on the way it's been received online by players and critics alike. The studio, which was founded by former Telltale developers, has taken a long, winding journey <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1985470807804453077">to get to the point where Dispatch is out and has sold over 1 million copies</a>. A journey that, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo">according to a new report</a>, included a stint at Ubisoft San Francisco, and how a new Splinter Cell game was eventually crushed under Ubisoft executives pushing for a games-as-a-service (GaaS) money-making game, which would become XDefiant.</p>



<p>It's a bit of a wild story, which is why it's not surprising that the reveal comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, a reporter who has essentially made a career out of telling some of the video game industry's most wild stories across all of his articles and his three books.</p>







<p>Nick Herman, co-founder of AdHoc, confirmed that after he and some of his fellow former Telltale cohorts left Telltale Games in 2017, <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/">which was just before the studio would close</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-revived/">though it was later revived</a>), they joined Ubisoft San Francisco. At the time, the studio was working on a new Splinter Cell game, and Herman was excited for the work he was doing each day.</p>



<p>"<em>I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it's been dormant for a while, and we thought we could tell a great story and do something the</em> <em>fans would love</em>," Herman said. Unfortunately, those feelings were eventually dashed, as the report explains that Ubisoft executives, who were (and probably still are) obsessed with getting a giant GaaS game in the company's portfolio, pressured development teams across the company to find a way to make their projects games-as-a-service games.</p>



<p>"<em>We tried</em>," Herman began. "<em>'Let's make a narrative GaaS game.' We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.</em>" Nothing was able to go the distance, however, and soon after, Herman understood that Ubisoft was not interested in making the kind of game he was interested in making.</p>



<p>"<em>It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great. And then you realize that all the things you care about, they don't anymore. It's a common thing in games</em>."</p>



<p>Herman and the rest of his former Telltale team members, who joined Ubisoft in 2017, would leave to start AdHoc in 2018 when the opportunity came, but the project that they left would grow to become XDefiant. According to the report, Ubisoft San Francisco started to focus more on wanting to make something to challenge Call of Duty, which is essentially what XDefiant was trying to do with its approach to multiplayer FPS gameplay.</p>



<p>So while Herman and his colleagues would go on to start AdHoc and eventually make Dispatch, under the stewardship of the same executive class that killed what is likely just one of many attempts at a new Splinter Cell game that've been crushed over the years, Ubisoft San Francisco went on to make <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">a free-to-play multiplayer game that was shut down a year after it came out</a>. Ubisoft San Francisco was also shut down as a result. A classic masterful gambit from Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Regarding new Splinter Cell games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">we know the team at Ubisoft Toronto is currently leading development on a remake of the first game</a>, but we've not had an update on that project for a while now.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-inspired-monster-hunter-feature-towns-guilds-raids/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling of Horizon Steel Frontiers</a> undoubtedly raised numerous questions for both fans of the franchise and the genre. How will it work, exactly? The games were single player only, except for the kid-friendly spin-off LEGO Horizon Adventures. Thankfully, IGN was able to obtain some answers <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Executive Producer Sunggu Lee</a>. To start, Lee admitted that the co-op hunting action featured in CAPCOM's Monster Hunter series was a heavy inspiration for Steel Frontiers:</p>



<p><em>Monster Hunter was definitely one of the key inspirations for Steel Frontiers. When we started expanding Horizon’s core concept of hunting massive machines into a multiplayer experience, the cooperative hunting system from the Monster Hunter series felt like a natural reference point. From the very beginning, combining Horizon’s rich world with the hunting-action genre just made sense. And when you add Horizon’s unique machine ecosystem, the part-breaking mechanics, and its deep storytelling, you get something that feels truly distinctive—an experience that’s uniquely Steel Frontiers.</em></p>



<p>Horizon Steel Frontiers is going to be an MMORPG set in the world originally created by Guerrilla Games. As such, it's no big surprise that Lee mentions towns and guilds as key systems in the game:</p>



<p><em>In Horizon Steel Frontiers, towns and guilds are really the heart of the community. Towns act as central hubs where players gather, prepare for hunts, and naturally connect with others. Out in the field, you might team up spontaneously with players you meet, or join forces in planned, strategic co-op play to take down tougher machines. These moments — whether unexpected or carefully coordinated — help strengthen bonds between players. And of course, we support all the core social features you’d expect from an MMORPG, like friends lists, chat, and party systems, so players can communicate and collaborate seamlessly.</em></p>



<p>The Executive Producer also discussed the changes to the combat system. Whereas Guerrilla's single player games are notoriously centered on ranged combat, the gameplay footage already showed that this will be a lot more melee-focused, and players will have to decide when to dodge and when to attack the machines. As an MMORPG, the game will support small parties to mid-sized raids, because truly large-scale raids would be confusing with this type of combat.</p>



<p>Despite Guerrilla promising some competition between tribes in the announcement video, Sunggu Lee says that the core content's focus is on PvE elements. No comment was made regarding the possible inclusion of Aloy or other characters. On the other hand, Lee confirmed that the game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of the Decima Engine.</p>



<p>Horizon Steel Frontiers <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is targeting a late 2026/early 2027 launch window</a> on PC and mobile, although NCSOFT is hoping to get Guerrilla (and Sony) <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-would-like-to-bring-horizon-steel-frontiers-to-ps5-say-it-cant-make-that-call-on-its-own/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to agree to port the game to PlayStation 5</a>, too. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-qa-we-have-big-plans/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-q-a-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98we-are-aware-of-our-significance-and-we-have-very-big-plans%E2%80%99.1354159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Saturday isn't usually a day of game releases, and yet it is the day that developer Battlestate Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has chosen to release version 1.0 of its highly popular game Escape from Tarkov</a>. Tomorrow, the game will officially exit early access and become available for the first time <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3932890/Escape_from_Tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, Valve's premier global PC gaming platform.</p>



<p>We first covered the game over nine years ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-tarkov-interview-truly-hardcore-first-person-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an interview conducted at Gamescom 2016</a>. The game then followed an unusual development pattern: Battlestate <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-closed-beta-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soft-launched it with the Closed Beta</a>, which became available on July 28, 2017, granting access to all pre-order customers and dropping the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) so that players could freely discuss the game on the Internet.</p>



<p>Since then, the studio slowly but surely expanded and improved the game, which gained a large following of players and became the de facto ancestor of a new shooter subgenre: the extraction shooter, where players enter a zone, scavenge it for loot, and fight against AI and player-controlled enemies in a dangerous bid to extract with those precious resources intact.</p>



<p>This type of game is so popular nowadays that its mechanics are even spilling into other genres, as we're seeing with extraction RPGs like <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Pantheon</a> (now known as Gods, Death &amp; Reapers), <a href="https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mistfall Hunter</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-sorcery-pvpve-extraction-arpg-gets-alpha-demo-for-steam-next-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-veteran-finds-funding-innsmouth-mysteries-lovecraft-co-op-extraction-rpg/">Innsmouth Mysteries</a>, just to name a few.</p>



<p>Still, Escape from Tarkov remains as alluring as ever with its hardcore, realistic, and uncompromising extraction military first-person shooter experience. With mere hours left separating us from the long-awaited 1.0 release, here's our exclusive chat with Game Director Nikita Buyanov, in which we discussed the road to launch, what's in it (and what's not), the studio's opinion on the burgeoning genre, and what's next for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The 1.0 release is, of course, a very large-scale update. It contains a massive amount of new content. The story alone is a huge part – players will finally get the chance to escape from Tarkov. If I'm not mistaken, preparing, developing, and integrating the release content took over 2 years. So yes – it's very large-scale.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It's been over 8 years since you first released Escape from Tarkov to pre-order players. How would you describe this long journey with your community?</strong></p>



<p>This wasn't just a long journey; it's been a part of our lives—mine and everyone at the studio. We grew up ourselves, and along with us, an entire generation of players grew up. It's been a very interesting, exciting, and challenging journey.</p>



<p><strong>Were you aware that it would take such a long time to get the game to version 1.0, or did you expect to launch earlier?</strong></p>



<p>That's a very good question. Of course, we planned to release it sooner. But creating a game, especially one with almost a decade of background, is a very complex process. We faced numerous obstacles in the form of various subsystems; some things we rewrote from scratch, other things we were the first to do, things no one had ever done before us. I think we would have released Tarkov sooner if we could predict the future and knew what we would face. We knew what we were doing, but at times we didn't know how to do it.</p>



<p><strong>Escape from Tarkov is arguably the forefather of extraction shooters. How does it feel to see it gain such popularity, and what do you think about the genre's latest success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark's ARC Raiders</a>?</strong></p>



<p>We are aware of our significance: we managed to create not just a game, but an entire subgenre – the extraction shooter. And when we see games that find their audience, like ARC Raiders, which you mentioned, we are only happy about it. After all, the more good games, the better. Unfortunately, not everyone views us the same way and sees us as a competitor; everyone strives to proclaim themselves the "Tarkov killer" and tries to "knock Tarkov off its pedestal." We never had the goal of climbing onto that pedestal. We are simply making a game. A game that we ourselves enjoy, and which, in its uniqueness, is suited specifically for hardcore players. That's all.</p>



<p><strong>Will the 1.0 release's content be as substantial as previous large updates (e.g., Reserve or Streets)?</strong></p>



<p>The 1.0 release is, of course, a very large-scale update. It contains a massive amount of new content. The story alone is a huge part – players will finally get the chance to escape from Tarkov. If I'm not mistaken, preparing, developing, and integrating the release content took over 2 years. So yes – it's very large-scale.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be a heat map or death cam feature in version 1.0?</strong></p>



<p>No, these features will not be in the release version, but we still plan to implement them in the future.</p>



<p><strong>What’s the roadmap for expansions or content updates after 1.0?</strong></p>



<p>The first DLC players can expect after release is "Scav Life." Players will dive into the story of the Scavs and see them from a different perspective. They will have their own little Hideout, as well as progression opportunities. In fact, we have a very broad planning horizon – there will be new locations and major events. Tarkov hasn't been fully explored and still holds many secrets.</p>



<p><strong>Where do you think the game is when it comes to anti-cheat measures? Are you looking to make further enhancements?</strong></p>



<p>The release version carries many changes aimed directly at combating cheaters. We have done a tremendous amount of work in this area and sincerely hope that things will be good on this front. Nevertheless, we certainly don't plan to stop here and will continue to improve our anti-cheat mechanics. We have a very large department at the studio working exclusively on this problem.</p>



<p><strong>What improvements will be made to server stability and matchmaking?</strong></p>



<p>I must point out that server stability isn't 100% within our control. However, the aspects that are our responsibility, including matchmaking, have undergone many changes, and we expect significant improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be further improvements in Quality of Life (QoL) for usability and user interface?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, this is also one of the important points that has our attention. We will continue to improve Quality of Life (QoL) and the User Interface (UI), both at release and after it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How are the narrative/story modes progressing? Is there anything you can share about that?</strong></p>



<p>The story consists of a chain of story quests. A clear storyline. It's not a narrative mode in the traditional sense. Answering your question, I can only say that players will finally have the opportunity to thoroughly understand what happened to the city and to escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p><strong>Are there plans to improve AI behavior, especially for Scavs and bosses?</strong></p>



<p>Of course, the Black Division alone is a significant addition. But the AI and the game as a whole have undergone a huge number of changes.</p>



<p><strong>Escape from Tarkov does not currently support controllers; however, a substantial number of PC players regularly utilize this control system in other games. Are you planning to add it in the future? Also, are you thinking about console ports?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</p>



<p><strong>What else does the future hold for Battlestate Games now that a decade-long project is concluding?</strong></p>



<p>We have very big plans. We plan to expand and do even more – to continue developing and deepening Tarkov, and to expand the universe. You will all see it soon.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
