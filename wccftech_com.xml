			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> presentation was a wave of new information about Nintendo's hotly anticipated console, and some of the first-party Nintendo games that will be available on the console either at launch, or later this year.</p>
<p>We also got confirmation for a number of third-party titles that will be available on the Nintendo Switch 2, including Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Hades 2, Hitman: World of Assassination, Hogwarts Legacy, Star Wars: Outlaws, and more.</p>
<p>Some of these games are classified as specific editions, like how Elden Ring for Nintendo Switch 2 isn't just called "<em>Elden Ring</em>," but instead is called "<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition,</em>" which in the case of Elden Ring signifies that this version of the game will include the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion.</p>
<p>The Tarnished Edition will also include new customizations for Torrent, new weapons, and new armor, when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>Some of the games confirmed were also brand new announcements, like a new FromSoftware game called The Duskbloods, or Enter the Gungeon 2. We also got a reiterated confirmation that Hollow Knight: Silksong is indeed planned to release sometime later in 2025.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition however, has been confirmed to launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p>
<p>But on the note of release dates, we don't know when each of these games will release, as some of them came with specific release dates, while others just had a release window for 2025, and others still had no release date attached to them at all.</p>

			<p>A new game by FromSoftware called The Duskbloods is coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2 next year.</p>
<p>Announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, the next game by the renowned development studio will be a brand-new multiplayer title sporting a rather eerie setting and atmosphere not too different from Bloodborne's and a deep dive into what feels like a vampire-themed story, so much so that the game almost feels like a new entry in the Castlevania series. Sadly, details are scarce at the moment, but judging from the trailer below, it seems like the game will share some similarities with Elden Ring: Nightreign, especially regarding characters' mobility. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn more about the game, as a developer diary series called Creator's Voice featuring director Hidetaka Miyazaki will be coming on April 4th.</p>

<p>Before The Duskbloods launches next year exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, although it will likely be a timed exclusive, FromSoftware will release the aforementioned Elden Ring: Nightreign next month on PC and consoles. You can learn more about the multiplayer game featuring roguelike mechanics set in the same world of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">2022 Game of the Year</a>, which is also launching on Nintendo Switch 2, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">hands-on preview</a> of the closed beta.</p>

			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is getting significantly upgraded on Nintendo Switch 2, with support for two different display modes supporting high resolution and framerates.</p>
<p>As confirmed during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, the fourth entry in the series launching later this year worldwide will also receive a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, which will take advantage of the system's power to offer two display modes. In Quality Mode, the game will run in docked mode at 4K resolution, 60 FPS with HDR support, and at 1080p, 60 FPS with HDR support in handheld mode. In Performance Mode, the game will run at 1080p resolution, 120 FPS with HDR support, and 720p resolution, 120 FPS and HDR in handheld mode. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Nintendo Switch 2 will also support the new Joy-Con 2 mouse functionality, which is sure to make the experience even better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a release date has yet to be officially confirmed for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, so we still don't know when we will be able to experience Samus Aran's new adventure and some of the game's mechanics, which include the Psychic Abilities shown in the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-new-gameplay-trailer-introduces-psychic-abilities-and-more/">latest trailer</a> last week. These abilities promise to spice up the experience considerably as they will allow Samus to operate mechanisms, open doors, control the trajectory of beams, and more.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">2025 release date</a> on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild And Tears Of The Kingdom Getting Upgraded Nintendo Switch 2 Versions]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-upgraded-nintendo-switch-2-versions/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-upgraded-nintendo-switch-2-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are two of the games getting upgraded versions for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2. </a></p>
<p>These new upgraded versions will be classified as the "Nintendo Switch 2 Editions" of each game, and if you already own either game, or any of the games that are getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you'll be able to get the new version by purchasing an upgrade pack.</p>
<p>Both games will enjoy improved visuals and framerates, with HDR compatibility added for both titles that are surely to make the painted art style for each game pop and look better than it has before.</p>
<p>Nintendo also revealed that the Nintendo Switch Online app would be renamed to the Nintendo Switch app and will include a "Zelda Notes" section that will provide helpful tips to players while they're exploring Hyrule, as well as allow Tears of the Kingdom users to easily share their creations.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 – 4.2.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VrTVeYm4iIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We don't yet know how much the upgrades are going to cost, though if you've yet to buy either Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom, it would be a good bet that both games are going to be available at the regular full price for brand-new Nintendo games.</p>
