			<p>Genshin Impact developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-developer-mihoyo-will-go-for-realistic-graphics-for-its-unreal-engine-5-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">miHoYo</a> has just unveiled its next open world game, Varsapura, with a 31-minute gameplay video.</p>



<p>The developers haven't shared much in the way of official details, but the footage provides more than a glimpse at what players will find in this upcoming title. The setting is a surreal, near-future city plagued by Mind Rot, a sort of parapsychological force that erodes reality, spawns monsters, and threatens both minds and the world at large.</p>



<p>It's all quite mysterious and subtly unsettling, a blend of bureaucracy (chiefly the SEAL, Shadow Emergency Alliance), psychic hazards, and mind-bending realities that reminded us of Remedy's Control. At the beginning of the demo, the player starts as an applicant to SEAL and undergoes mind-verification, interviews, and psychological evaluation as they attempt to join an organization dedicated to containing or reversing mind rot events. Later, they become an operational SEAL officer, and that's where we first see the combat of Varsapura. It looks like a fairly standard action combat system, featuring fast-paced action where the protagonist uses an umbrella to damage foes both in melee and from afar.</p>



<p>Some missions seemingly involve environmental hazards and puzzles, such as avoiding mind rot contamination, reacting to unstable environments, and using unique character abilities. Moreover, unlike in Control and more like miHoYo's games, the player will be able to count on the help of NPC squadmates.</p>



<p>At some point in the demo, we see that players will be able to drive vehicles to navigate the open-world environment. Varsapura also appears to offer RPG-style dialogue options to choose from, and some of them even seem to use specific character attributes or skills, like Empathy, Persuasion, or Deception, to accomplish their goal. Of course, the extent of the dialogue's consequences remains unclear at this point. </p>

<p>Varsapura, which is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, is still clearly a long way from launch. In fact, miHoYo is recruiting more people across its <a href="https://jobs.mihoyo.com/#/position?jobName=Varsapura" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shanghai</a>, <a href="https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/careers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singapore, and Los Angeles</a> offices to work on the project.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB's rating of Silent Hill 2 on Xbox</a>, KONAMI has announced today that the remake of the classic survival horror game is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/SILENT-HILL-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now available on Xbox Series S and X and on the Xbox PC Store</a>. The game actually supports Xbox Play Anywhere, so you'll get it on both platforms with a single purchase.</p>



<p>The Japanese publisher has also attached a promotion to the launch: the game's Standard and Deluxe Edition are currently 50% off on the new platform, and the same applies on PlayStation 5. The Steam version doesn't have any discount for the time being, but KONAMI might just be waiting for the platform's Black Friday sale to trigger it.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 Standard Edition is thus priced at $34.99 on the Xbox ecosystem, while the Deluxe Edition costs $39.99. There is also a dual pack with Silent Hill f, which launched a couple of months ago. The Standard Edition of this dual pack is priced at $79.99, while the Deluxe Edition will set you back $95.99. Silent Hill f is also separately discounted by 20% as part of KONAMI's Black Friday sale.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake was released in October 2024 to widespread acclaim. Bloober Team's work <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a 9 out of 10 here on Wccftech</a> by reviewer Chris Wray:</p>



<p><em>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</em></p>



<p>To date, the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has sold more than 2.5 million units</a>, making it likely this Xbox release will push it toward 3 million copies sold in the near future. Following this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful release of Silent Hill f</a>, the franchise's next installment is the spin-off Townfall, which a retailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently listed for a March 2026 debut</a>.</p>
