			<p>It's been nearly a year since <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>, the relaunch of Amazon's MMORPG that introduced console versions with cross-play and a lot more. The developers were certainly hoping to get a big boost to the active player base, but that didn't quite happen.</p>



<p>However, that might change next week with the upcoming debut of Season 10, which is already garnering a lot of interest among MMO fans. Admittedly, it's not the most exciting time in the genre; sure, there's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-qa-homesteads-new-elite-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2 expansion Visions of Eternity</a> due later this month, and ZeniMax will release the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online, while Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has opened the Alpha test of World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>. But all those games are pretty old (if not very, very old) at this point. The only new MMORPG release of the year will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pax Dei's 1.0</a>, which, unfortunately, does not look like it will be ready for prime time when it comes to polish and features.</p>



<p>Compared to the aforementioned games, New World is undoubtedly much more recent, having launched in September 2021. Some of you will even remember that it was quite popular at first, with Jeff Bezos <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applauding Amazon Game Studios for its first successful release</a>. That did not last due to a severe lack of content, which led players (myself included) to leave in droves.</p>

<p>It took a long time, but the New World development team is slowly getting there, and the new season is very appealing. Nighthaven will introduce an eponymous new zone that, in a lengthy dev diary, was described as the game's largest and most vertical map, contrasting with previous additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-brimstone-sands-update-out-now-adds-a-new-zone-new-weapon-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brimstone Sands</a> (which was horizontal and barren). Visually, it is a love letter to classic horror with macabre, Eastern Europe-inspired aesthetics featuring towering castles, decrepit dungeons, and sweeping pine forests.</p>



<p>Not only does Nighthaven feature more points of interest, lore notes, and quests, it even adds some new interactive exploration and combat mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Chandeliers:</strong> Shoot them to drop on enemies (or risk them falling on you), reinforcing "look up."</li>



<li><strong>Throwables and Flammables:</strong> Use torches or fire staffs to burn spider webs and rat nests, expanding on systems from Cutlass Keys' lightning fields.</li>



<li><strong>Doors and Secrets: </strong>Various doors (bookcase, metal, wooden, magic-locked) lead to hidden areas.</li>



<li><strong>Arcana Tarot System: </strong>Collect 22 major Arcana cards (with Aeternum twists) to unlock tarot towers, elite chests, and caches. Combines with ancient glyphs for puzzles; encourages exploration via jump pads instead of guides.</li>



<li><strong>New Exploration Elements:</strong> Swim through mazes, dodge lasers, use water jets/elevators for vertical traversal.</li>



<li><strong>Jump Pads:</strong> Borrowed from the OPR (Outpost Rush) mode for open-world traversal in the region.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are many horror-inspired creatures, from vampires to werewolves, bats, gargoyles, and even Frankenstein-inspired constructs, and a new story to follow, of course. But the most exciting additions to New World, at least for the long term, are arguably those that seek to expand the endgame.</p>



<p>First and foremost, there will be a new 10-man raid titled Isle of Night. This will be the new toughest PvE challenge in the game, featuring many new enemy types and three boss fights, each with unique mechanics to encourage group coordination. Amazon Game Studios is also adding a Catacombs mode where players venture into a procedurally generated dungeon with a countdown. Through a Catacombs run, they will obtain various power-ups and rewards and have to decide whether to keep going forward or exit before time runs out to retain the rewards. </p>



<p>Progression is getting a big shake-up as well. Level cap is increasing to 70, and the Gear Score is being raised from 725 to 800. Additionally, any Gear with Gear Score of 700 and more will be upgradeable all the way with the new Umbral system.</p>



<p>But there's more: gear can now have up to four empty sockets called Perk Charms, which are roughly split into four categories (offensive, defensive, skill, gems), allowing for greater build customization. Plus, the new gear from PvP, Catacombs, and the Isle of Night raid will feature set bonuses for the first time, making it even more important to get all the pieces in a set.</p>

<p>You need only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1o02qyg/is_new_world_back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go to the MMORPG subreddit</a> to see that there are a lot of positive vibes among MMO fans about Nighthaven (which will go live on October 13 on PC and consoles) and New World as a whole. Could it be the start of a big comeback for Amazon's game? Hopefully, but even greater is the hope that the studio will have learned its lesson ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming The Lord of the Rings MMO they are making</a>.</p>

			<p>Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person according to Forbes, made a big claim yesterday when he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that the xAI Game Studio would release a 'great' full-scale AI generated videogame by the end of next year.</p>



<p>It was nearly a year ago when Musk, a known videogamer, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861801046949191686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that xAI, known mainly for the Grok generative AI chatbot, would 'make games great again':</p>



<p><em>Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. @xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!</em></p>



<p>Grok is considered to be one of the top chatbots, but making a full-fledged AI generated game (and a 'great' one at that) seems like a task far beyond the currently available technology to xAI and anyone else, for that matter.</p>



<p>It was just two years ago when NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research Bryan Catanzaro, who can be considered the father of the DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling technology, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>I do not believe that AI is gonna build games in a way where you just write a paragraph about making a cyberpunk game and then pop comes out something as good as Cyberpunk 2077. I do think that let's say DLSS 10 in the far future is going to be a completely neural rendering system that interfaces with a game engine in different ways, and because of that, it's going to be more immersive and more beautiful.</em></p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, there have been great advancements in the field of LLMs, but not nearly enough to create a great triple-A game yet, something I'm sure game developers are thankful for. That's not to say it will never happen, and AI will undoubtedly be used more and more in the gaming space, but to speed up and enhance the work of humans, not replace it outright. At least for the foreseeable future.</p>
