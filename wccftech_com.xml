			<p>Games industry analyst firm MIDiA Research has published a new report titled “The winning formula for Grand Theft Auto VI” where they explain why Take-Two Interactive should price GTA VI at $69.99.</p>



<p>To reach this consensus, the analysts used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor%E2%80%93Granger_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabor-Granger method</a> and surveyed more than 2,000 United States consumers. According to their findings, the rumored $100 launch price (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocated by Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter</a> but <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed by Alinea Analytics analyst Rhys Elliott</a>) would reduce both unit sales and overall revenue. In contrast, the industry-standard price of $69.99 would maximize the sales potential and align with consumer expectations.</p>



<p>The study found that 79% of consumers interested in GTA VI said they would “definitely” or “probably” buy the game for $49.99, compared to 16% at a theoretical $149.99. Among superfans, the willingness to purchase at $149.99 was nearly twice that of the average consumer (9% versus 5%), but it was not enough to offset the overall loss in demand. </p>



<p>At the suggested optimal price of $69.99, MIDiA Research reckons approximately 8.6% of the U.S. adult population would purchase the game, for 22.9 million copies sold and $1.6 billion in revenue.</p>



<p>Perry Gresham, Head of Data at MIDiA Research and co-author of the report, said:</p>



<p><em>Our research suggests that GTA VI will generate more revenue at a standard $69.99 price point than the much-discussed $100. A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table. Below the optimum price, increasing price increases revenue, but prices above the optimum can result in loss of both unit sales and revenue. This is because the revenue increase from those who still purchase will be less than the lost revenue from those who do not.</em></p>



<p>Brandon Sutton, Games Analyst at MIDiA and co-author of the report, added:</p>



<p><em>Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA VI, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game. This notoriety also makes GTA VI the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, Grand Theft Auto VI was originally scheduled to launch in Fall 2025 but <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed to May 26, 2026</a>. Fans are hoping there won't be any more delays, but with Rockstar, it's hard to say.</p>

			<p>Another week, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-battlefield-6/">another batch of games entering</a> the NVIDIA GeForce NOW library of games available to be streamed over the cloud service, including another title being added to the list of games streamable through NVIDIA's RTX 5080 graphics cards. More areas will also be able to take advantage of those 5080 graphics cards, as NVIDIA is adding Ashburn, Portland, and London to the list of places where streaming with RTX 5080 cards is available "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>The big title this week is Battlefield 6, which we knew was heading<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-battlefield-6-arc-raiders-bloodlines-2-and-more-in-october/"> into the cloud service since the beginning of this month</a>, and will be available to stream at launch tomorrow using NVIDIA's RTX 5080 cards.</p>



<p>Other notable titles entering this week are King of Meat, the brawler that is a cooking show and a death arena where chaos is really the reigning king. It launched in early access this week on October 7, and is available to stream on GeForce NOW.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares III is another interesting title joining the library this week, both because it's the continuation of the Little Nightmares <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">series that has grown in a full-fledged franchise</a>, and because it's the first game in the series not developed by Tarsier, but by Supermassive Games.</p>



<p>Beyond what's new, GeForce NOW is also adding a bit of something old, with The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - Game of the Year Edition joining the library of GeForce NOW games this week.</p>

<p>NVIDIA is also adding more than just games this week, as its new integration with Discord, <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">which was shown off at Gamescom 2025</a>, arrives this week with Fortnite as the first game on the list of available titles. Essentially, you can go from talking to your friend on Discord, to playing Fortnite with them over GeForce NOW, even without a GeForce NOW subscription at up to 1440p and 60 FPS.</p>



<p>More games are going to add support for this new integration, but for now you'll be able to try it out with Fortnite to see how easy it can be to go from talking to your friends about playing some games to actually playing some games, without even having to move away from your conversation on Discord.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games entering the GeForce NOW library this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deathground (October 7)</li>



<li>King of Meat (October 7)</li>



<li>Seafarer: The Ship Sim (October 7)</li>



<li>Little Nightmares III (October 9)</li>



<li>Battlefield 6 (October 10)</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - Game of the Year Edition</li>
</ul>



<p>With regards to adding Portland, Ashburn, and London to the list of available regions for using RTX 5080 cards with GeForce NOW, Portland is on dock to be added next, with more information about Ashburn, London, and every other new area after that <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/server-upgrade/">coming soon from NVIDIA's website</a>.</p>

			<p>Nintendo of America is seeking over 4 million US dollars in damages from James C. Williams, a known Redditor who moderated a now-closed subreddit focused on pirating Nintendo Switch games.</p>



<p>On October 3, the American branch of the Japanese company submitted <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">a filing at the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> requesting $4.5 million in damages following a legal battle against James C. Williams, also known as Archbox, that began in March 2024. </p>



<p>In the filing, Nintendo of America highlights how Archbox's activities have <em>"substantially damaged NOA’s overall business and intellectual property rights, as well as the business and intellectual property rights of NOA's development and publishing partners, and further has caused harm to the many artists, game designers, programmers and others whose livelihoods depend upon the sale of authorized Nintendo products."</em></p>



<p>The company's $4.5 million claim is<em> "nowhere near an amount that would compensate NOA for the seriousness of Defendants’ conduct,"</em> the filing continues, as the actual amount of money sufficient to remedy the injury.</p>



<p>Although James C. <em>"Archbox"</em> Williams is one of the two individuals targeted by Nintendo in its July 2024 lawsuit, they aren't the only member of the SwitchPirates subreddit the publisher has looked into. Last year, it was confirmed that the Japanese publisher was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-piracy-members-subreddit/">seeking the go-ahead from the court to subpoena business records from internet domain companies</a> NameCheap, GoDaddy, Tucows, Cloudflare, GitHub, Discord, Google, and Reddit to identify anyone who helped Archobox with their illicit activities, which were made explicit in the now-closed subreddit.</p>



<p>Nintendo has always held a very strong stance against piracy, a stance that only hardened ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 this year. In 2024, the Japanese publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">shut down the Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx Nintendo Switch emulators</a> to prevent Switch games from being played on PC without the system and mandatory purchase of official game releases.</p>
