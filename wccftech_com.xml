			<p>During the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025, the publisher announced a new dark fantasy game called Fatekeeper. This project is in development at a small studio in the German Alps, which is home to around ten former Spellforce III developers from Grimlore Games.</p>



<p>The idea behind the project came from a discussion about Hellraid, Techland's game, which seemed like it would finally follow in the footsteps of Arkane's classic Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. The developers felt (rightfully so, I might add) that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic was the first game to make first-person melee action combat feel really cool.</p>



<p>They were also disheartened when Hellraid turned out into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-hellraid-review-hellish-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small DLC pack for Dying Light</a> instead of the full-fledged standalone game that had originally been promised. Following that news, they decided to take matters into their own hands and create their own take on this oft-neglected genre. Thus, Fatekeeper was born, a title with modern graphics (it is powered by Unreal Engine 5), classic RPG elements, and first-person melee action combat.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Every item in the game can be inspected in the menu, and a lot of the items have hidden mechanics that are unlocked only after inspecting them properly. Following the inspiration of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Fatekeeper also allows for deep interactions with the environment, especially when using telekinesis on various objects and characters.</p>



<p>The developers are still working on the progression systems, such as the skill trees, so they haven't been shown yet. However, they promised progression would have considerable depth, like any other system in the game.</p>



<p>Fatekeeeper will be semi-linear. It's not an open world title, but the maps have been designed so that players can devise a lot of paths. While not as hard as a Souls game, this title should also provide plenty of challenge to players who seek that in games.</p>



<p>Frankly, it's about time that someone had such an idea and implemented it. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is long overdue for a spiritual successor, that's for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic have confirmed a new release window for the Gothic 1 Remake, which was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166">previously</a> set to arrive before the end of 2025, will now launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S in early 2026. The delay is confirmed alongside the debut of a new gameplay trailer, and the release of a demo for the game finally coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>There's been a demo available for PC players to try out for months now, while console players have been left out of the loop. Now, PS5 and Xbox Series owners can try out the remake for themselves, ahead of its launch sometime in early next year.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019, with a surprise teaser demo to gauge players' interest. However, it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020</a> that players knew the remake would be happening for sure. </p>



<p>By the time it arrives in early 2026, it'll be nearly seven years from its announcement to its release, and it'll be nearly 20 years since the last time a new Gothic game was released. There's no indication yet that Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic are looking to make a brand new Gothic adventure, but if the coming remake is wildly successful, the chances of a new game in the series would greatly increase. </p>



<p>We'll find out sometime early next year if this remake has been worth the wait, and if there's any chance at more Gothic games in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside the new gameplay shown in today's showcase and the news of the demo hitting consoles, THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive also announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-classic-1-3-are-coming-to-playstation-and-xbox-in-2026/">original three Gothic games will be making their console debuts</a>, arriving on PlayStation and Xbox sometime in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grimlore-games-has-shadow-dropped-titan-quest-ii-now-available-in-early-access-on-pc.1260201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Grimlore Games confirmed that players anxious to jump into Titan Quest II would be able to do so with the game's early access launch set for sometime during the summer of 2025. Today, during its publisher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPVmpg6koqc">THQ Nordic's Digital Showcase</a> for 2025, the studio shadow-dropped Titan Quest II, and you can rush over to Steam or the Epic Games Store to play it right now.</p>



<p>The new trailer that debuted during today's showcase features plenty of the action-packed scenarios players will encounter in their mythological journey through Ancient Greece, and a few of the quieter moments, as it shows off the work that Grimlore Games has put into improving graphical fidelity and combat.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Titan Quest II was initially set to arrive sometime during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025</a>, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/">announced in May</a> that it would be delayed until sometime in the summer. Which makes today's news hit even harder as a pleasant surprise for players who were hoping to have already put in dozens of hours to Titan Quest II.</p>



<p>Especially the players who got to participate in playtests for the game earlier this year. Even though the decision to delay the game came from these same playtests, Grimlore Games said that "<em>over 92%"</em> of the players who participated in the demo playtest it hosted came away with a 'positive' or 'very positive' rating of the game.</p>



<p>Of course, it wouldn't have been delayed if not for the myriad of issues players called out, like combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balancing, so everyone jumping into the early access launch today will be sure to pay attention to how those aspects of the game have changed in the last few months. And then everything will surely be tweaked further, as it begins its early access journey and the back-and-forth between the studio and community feedback that'll shape the game's development.</p>



<p>When the 1.0 version of Titan Quest II launches, it'll be available for $49.99 / €49.99. The early access version, however, is available on all platforms for $29.99 / €29.99, and if you grab it anytime within its opening week, you'll get it for 20% less, at $23.99 / €23.99.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/weappy-studio-debuts-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-gameplay-no-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/weappy-studio-debuts-new-impressive-looking-gameplay-for-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-still-no-release-date.1260198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Eternal Life of Goldman is a new 2D action-platformer from Weappy Studio, and is easily one of the most impressive-looking 2D platformers on the market, thanks to everything being animated by hand. We just got another look at some more gameplay during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Digital Showcase</a> today, with the game looking arguably even better than it has before, with some new shots in a new trailer. The only downside, though, is that there's still no release date in sight.</p>



<p>While we didn't get any release date news, we did get a bit more of an insight into the story of the game, with the gameplay being shown while a mom and her son discuss Goldman, with the mom becoming more agitated as she divulges how Goldman spent his life pouring over maps, looking for some kind of ultimate treasure that consumed his every waking moment.</p>



<p>By the end of the trailer, she's yelling at her son as she's clearly angry for having followed Goldman in the first place, with the last few lines eerily delivered by the young boy, who doesn't completely understand why or how he's upset his mother, but is now clearly scared of her to some degree, as we're left watching Goldman descend into a dark chasm, and we're left wondering what happened to the boy.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The manual animation style of The Eternal Life of Goldman calls back to games like Cuphead, which was also entirely animated by hand, and is regarded as one of the best 2D games in the past decade.</p>



<p>To be fair, Goldman still needs to stick the landing with its gameplay, Cuphead didn't win all its accolades based on looks alone. But if these trailers can be believed, 2D platforming fans will be in for a treat when The Eternal Life of Goldman launches. </p>



<p>Now if only we knew when it was launching.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-permanent-price-cut-ci-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ci-games-permanently-lowers-the-price-of-lords-of-the-fallen-as-part-of-its-%E2%80%9Cplayer-first%E2%80%9D-committment.1260120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CI Games, the studio behind the Lords of the Fallen games, has permanently lowered the price of the 2023 Lords of the Fallen title, which was previously available for $69.99 USD on consoles and $59.99 USD on PC. Now, the price is $29.99 USD / €29.99 / £24.99 for the standard edition on all platforms, with the deluxe edition lowered to $39.99 USD / €39.99 / £34.99.</p>



<p>This also isn't just a cut to the 2023 Lords of the Fallen. The entire CI Games catalogue of titles is getting a permanent price cut, with all of the studio's previous games now listed at $29.99 USD / €29.99 / £24.99 or lower.</p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1951319064116179355">X</a>, the chief executive officer of CI Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-developer-ci-games-boss-claims-he-has-data-that-proves-modern-audience-is-a-false-myth/">Marek Tyminski</a>, cites the price of physical copies dropping in retail stores as one of the reasons for the digital versions getting cheaper, and also claims it to be part of the studio's "<em>player first</em>" approach.</p>



<p>"<em>Keeping games full price on digital stores while physical copies drop is wrong. Ironically, physical costs more per unit to make and sell. Big discounts from inflated prices look better — but that’s not real value.</em> <em>We’re slashing prices across the entire CI Games catalog — and we’re committed to keeping it that way. Fair pricing. Players first.</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>When Lords of the Fallen launched in 2023, it did so in a poor state, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">with our reviewer,</a> Francesco De Meo, saying that he "<em>was disappointed to see how the game failed to deliver an enjoyable experience. Some die-hard Souls series fans may find some enjoyment in the 35 or so hours-long journey to save Mournstead, but everyone else likely won't be able to see past the game's many shortcomings."</em></p>



<p>A 2.0 update that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">arrived earlier this year</a> marked a huge improvement, and the game has still been able to surpass <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-reaches-more-than-5-5-million-players/">5.5 million players since launch</a>, but it's definitely not been the journey that Tyminski and the rest of CI Games would have envisioned. </p>



<p>At least the price cuts are a tangible way for CI Games to show its players that it is committed to giving them a product that is worth what they paid for it.</p>
