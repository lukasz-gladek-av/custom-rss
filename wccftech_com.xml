			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-netflix-live-action-series-announced-by-ubisoft/">All the way back in 2020</a>, Netflix and Ubisoft announced that they were working on a live-action adaptation of Ubisoft's marquee franchise, Assassin's Creed. For nearly five years after that announcement, the show seemingly didn't make any progress. Though <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">after getting the green light this past July</a>, the show has already begun to find members of its cast, and now, a director.</p>



<p>A report from November <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-series-casts-toby-wallace-as-co-lead/">confirmed that Toby Wallace would star as one of the co-lead characters in the adaptation</a>, and now a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/">Variety</a> adds that Johan Renck, the Emmy-winning director best known for his work on Chernobyl, the series created by HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin, has been tapped to direct Assassin's Creed for Netflix.</p>



<p>The report also adds that, beyond Wallace, Lola Petticrew, Zachary Hart, and Laura Marcus have all joined the cast as regulars for the series, though we don't yet know who any of the actors will be playing as details of the adaptation's plot are being kept quiet for now.</p>



<p>We do know that the series will begin filming in Italy in 2026, and that Italy is also reportedly the geographical setting for the series. The show's logline says the story will be "<em>centred on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny</em>."</p>



<p>If you know anything about Assassin's Creed, then you know that the logline does nothing more than outline the basic facts of the game's stories since the first game was released back in 2007. So it seems like we'll be waiting for a while longer before actually learning what era and elements of the Assassin's Creed story the show will lean on.</p>



<p>The series is being led by showrunners Roberto Patino and David Weiner, with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, and Genevieve Jones from Ubisoft's film and television department serving as executive producers. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The process of EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">going private and selling to a 'Consortium' of investors, which includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Jared Kushner's Silver Lake</a>, has just crossed its first hurdle. As initially reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mamalgryks2m">Stephen Totilo at Game File</a>, EA's shareholders have voted to approve the sale of EA to the Consortium.</p>



<p>Now, the privatization sale has to be approved by government regulators, a process which, if <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-aims-to-close-activision-blizzard-acquisition-next-friday/">Microsoft's journey to acquiring Activision Blizzard King is any indication</a>, will take longer than a few months, considering that EA announced the sale back in September and shareholders have already approved it before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Particularly because after one major video game industry acquisition made government regulators around the world pay more attention to the industry, we could see EA's deal face more scrutiny from global regulators. There have <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">already been voices of concern from US senators</a> in letters to the Secretary of the Treasury over the deal, alleging that the sale could allow for "<em>the Saudi government’s ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company</em>," the letter reads.</p>



<p>It's not just within the US that voices of concern over the deal are being raised. <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/12/cwa-canada-urges-competition-bureau-to-scrutinize-55-billion-electronic-arts-buyout/">CWA Canada is also asking Canada's competition regulators to scrutinize the deal closely</a>, with concerns shared for the Canadian developers EA employs at its Canadian-based studios, including Motive, EA Vancouver, and BioWare.</p>



<p>While the US senators' letter to the Secretary of the Treasury voiced concerns over foreign influence, CWA Canada's letter to the Canadian Competition Bureau shared more concerns about the job losses and layoffs that could result from the sale. </p>



<p>"<em>Relatedly, the transaction could lead to reductions in jobs in Canadian labor markets. EA has said publicly that the deal would not lead to “immediate” layoffs, but with the deal being financed with US$20 billion in debt, some analysts suggest layoffs are one of the key ways the company will seek to cut costs in order to service its massive debt. Layoffs could further consolidate and concentrate existing labor markets for video game workers in Canada. Our concerns are compounded by the company’s history of recent layoffs: EA has laid off over 1,700 workers since 2023</em>."</p>



<p>We're still a long way off from this deal going through; like the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard King deal, we'll likely be hearing about it for well over a year before it is finalized, if it does indeed end up happening.</p>



<p>If it doesn't go through, then we'll likely return to a status quo in the video game industry. If it does, then the Saudi Arabia PIF will own 93.4% of EA, with the other Consortium investors vying for the remaining 6.6%. </p>

			<p>There's been a lot of discussion on whether <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> would price <strong>GTA 6</strong> at the regular $70-$80 range of most triple-A games or become the first title to break the scary <strong>$100</strong> threshold.</p>



<p>The debate was <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally sparked</a> by Wedbush Securities analyst <strong>Michael Pachter</strong>, who predicted in August that the developer would make this bold choice and get away with it due to the game's massive hype. We at Wccftech quickly sought the opinion of another analyst, <strong>Rhys Elliot</strong> from Alinea Analytics, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countered</a> that it would be a bad idea as it would limit the barrier of entry to GTA 6 Online, which, if GTA 5 is any measure, will over time become Rockstar's main revenue driver. The most likely scenario would see Rockstar offering an optional, higher-priced edition, just like most triple-A publishers do nowadays, while keeping the base edition at its regular price.</p>



<p>Now, former Rockstar animator Mike York revealed a similar outlook in an interview <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Esports Insider</a>. </p>



<p><em>I don't think the price tag for GTA 6 will be $100. I think it will come out at $70, around the flatline of normal releases. I don't think Rockstar Games feel they need to release it at a higher cost. They'll sell so many copies of the game that they won't need to be greedy and charge $100. They don't need to leave that sour taste in people's mouths if they don't have to, so I don't think they'll do that.</em> <em>It might have a $99 day-one version if you pre-order it, where it gives you a huge bundle when GTA Online comes out. You have your own apartment or something like that. But the base game will be $70.</em></p>



<p>The other big question mark on the game pertains to its launch date. It has already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed twice</a>, after all, and fans are really worried there might be a third time. York, however, isn't concerned:</p>



<p><em>I think the game will be released in November 2026, as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games, then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually, companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time</em>.</p>



<p>GTA 6 is currently scheduled to launch on November 15, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p>In other Grand Theft Auto 6 news, we recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a>, thanks to an <strong>exclusive Wccftech interview</strong>, that the game's online mode might include features typically seen in MMORPGs. </p>
