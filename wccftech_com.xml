			<p>Ghost of Yotei will launch in early October on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, a new trailer shared today confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBLJYjSAhg&amp;t=2s">The new trailer</a>, which can be watched below, confirmed the game will launch on the current generation PlayStation consoles on October 2nd worldwide. Besides confirming the release date, the new trailer also provides a new look at the Yotei Six, gang members that Atsu has sworn to hunt down. Needless to say, the game is looking great and is a considerable step up from Ghost of Tsushima, which was originally released on PlayStation 4 and was later ported to PlayStation 5 and PC to offer improved visuals and more.</p>
