			<p>The Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT mod breathes new life into the visuals of the classic game, but the performance cost is considerable—even on a top-end GPU like the RTX 5080.</p>



<p>The mod, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/">first work-in-progress release</a> was launched earlier this month, uses RTX Remix to overhaul the visuals of the iconic No Mercy campaign with realistic lighting, high-resolution PBR materials, and full compatibility with ray tracing technologies. </p>



<p>A fresh comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts the original game and the RTX Remix modded version running side-by-side, highlighting how the massive visual overhaul comes at a significant performance cost</p>



<p>While the performance difference varies between different scenarios, the hit is always dramatic. In one sequence (at the 1:10 mark), the modded Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT runs at an average of around 30 FPS at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. This is in sharp contrast to the vanilla game, which exceeds 500 FPS on the same RTX 5080 GPU.</p>



<p>The performance hit is similarly massive in another sequence (at 1:29), dropping from the high 500 FPS range down to the 50 FPS range. Once again, it’s clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">current gaming hardware can still not handle full path tracing</a> without heavily relying on upscaling and frame generation to hit playable framerates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Quantic Dream, the studio co-founded by David Cage and known for single-player, story-driven games like Detroit: Become Human, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls, and is currently working on Star Wars: Eclipse, has announced that it is making a competitive multiplayer game.</p>



<p>"<em>For over 28 years, Quantic Dream has been pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling,</em>" co-founder David Cage writes in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">the opening of a blog post on the studio's website</a>, which announced the new competitive multiplayer title, a genre not exactly known for its storytelling.</p>



<p>"<em>After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step. Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been a part of our DNA.</em> <em>We know how demanding it is to create something new. Earning the trust of players, standing out in such a competitive space, and introducing fresh concepts is incredibly challenging. And since we have no legacy in this genre, we know we have everything to prove, which is why your support and feedback will be essential. Together, we believe we can create something truly unique</em>."</p>



<p>The singular mention of Star Wars: Eclipse comes in the following line, where all Cage says is, "<em>Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you</em> <em>in the future</em>." The last update we got for Star Wars: Eclipse before this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/">was in 2023, when the game was "<em>simmering</em>."</a> Since then, it's lead writer, who had been with Quantic Dream for years and led writing on games like Detroit: Become Human, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/">left and formed his own studio</a>.</p>



<p>To call this announcement a "<em>surprise</em>" is a grave understatement, since Quantic Dream is arguably the last studio anyone would expect to make a competitive multiplayer game. It's also a major risk, since we've seen multiple single-player, narrative-game-focused studios try to pivot to multiplayer games before, and failing miserably.</p>







<p>Of course, there's always the chance that the stars align for Cage and Quantic Dream, and whatever competitive multiplayer game they make becomes a huge success. We can always hope for the best outcome, but if the history of studios making a pivot like this can teach us anything, it's that Quantic Dream has a difficult, and more than likely ruinous path ahead of it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-calls-tencent%E2%80%99s-defense-of-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-%E2%80%9Dnonsense%E2%80%9D.1326541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In November 2024, Tencent revealed Light of Motiram, an MMO that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">to practically everyone's eyes, including ours</a>, looked like a carbon-copy clone of PlayStation and Guerrilla Games' Horizon series. It was so evident that when Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/">over the game and called it a "<em>slavish clone</em>,"</a> no one was surprised.</p>



<p>After making significant changes to Light of Motiram's Steam page, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/">including removing certain screenshots and changing the game's description,</a> all to seemingly make it look more vague and less directly like a Horizon rip-off, Tencent fired back at Sony with a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/">even Guerrilla Games admitted that Horizon wasn't an original idea in the first place</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Sony has fired right back at Tencent. In a new filing first reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post,</a> Sony directly calls Tencent's defence "<em>nonsense</em>," and that Tencent's continued promotion of Light of Motiram has already inflicted the damage Sony cites in its copyright suit.</p>



<p>"<em>Tencent remarkably contends SIE's claims are unripe because - despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months - Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram's release until 2027 after SIE sued. This is nonsense. The damage is done, and it continues."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Although the public expressed confusion and outrage upon discovering Light of Motiram for the knock-off that it is, Tencent remained undeterred. Tencent continued promoting its infringing game over SIE's objection, and Tencent refused to accept any responsibility over its conduct</em>."</p>



<p>The suit goes on to claim that Tencent even tried to dodge liability "<em>by playing a shell game with its brands and entities</em>." Tencent (or more specifically Tencent Holdings), according to Sony, is the one Sony should be suing, because Tencent owns the IP to Light of Motiram, the US trademark for the game, and the official website. Tencent Holdings is also the parent of Tencent Games, so it's appropriate for Sony to go directly after Tencent Holdings, in Sony's view.</p>



<p>Tencent claimed that Sony shouldn't be suing Tencent Holdings, but Polaris Quest and Aurora Studios, the teams developing and publishing Light of Motiram. Both Polaris Quest and Aurora Studios are subsidiaries of Tencent.</p>



<p>"<em>After SIE was forced to sue, Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities. Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that 'own[s] Aurora Studios' - the Light of Motiram development studio. Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram, without distinguishing between subsidiaries.</em> <em>Insofar as Tencent Holdings is in fact operating the gaming business through subsidiaries, it is controlling them. Tencent Holdings' senior management includes Ma Xiaoyi, who Tencent Holdings represents</em> <em>'is responsible for international publishing of Tencent Games.'"</em></p>



<p>For good measure, the new filing calls out once again how public response to Light of Motiram was to directly call it a Horizon knock-off, and went even further to call the game not just copyright, but trademark infringement over the red-haired protagonist that features in Light of Motiram's reveal. The character Aloy is a symbol of the PlayStation and Sony brand, the company argues, and Tencent's own red-haired "<em>lookalike</em>" was "<em>so egregious that numerous journalists and Horizon fans noted the striking similarities between the ALOY Character Mark and Tencent's use of the Aloy lookalike, stating Tencent's lookalike 'resembles Aloy to a tee, red hair and all.'"</em></p>



<p>Sony even quoted one journalist who said, "<em>If someone told me this is a spin-off of [Horizon], I would easily believe them</em>."</p>



<p>Now, Sony wants the court to dismiss Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and go straight into the discovery phase, so Sony can begin digging through Tencent's files regarding Light of Motiram and its development, in the hopes of discovering evidence it can use to further argue that Tencent is committing copyright infringement with Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>However this suit ends, it'll definitely set an interesting precedent for future copyright cases in games. We'll continue to follow it and provide updates as they come.
