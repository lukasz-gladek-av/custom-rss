			<p>Following the rumor that Sony would be interested in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring</a> FromSoftware's parent company, Kadokawa Corporation, the two companies have just <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/news/20241219_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that they have entered a strategic capital and business alliance that will make Sony the largest shareholder with around 10% of Kadokawa's stock. It's not the first time, as the companies <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-software-owner-kadokawa-corporation-alliance-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made</a> a similar announcement three years ago, but it sounds like they're getting tighter. Sony is investing roughly $320 million to acquire 12 million new shares of the Japanese multimedia company.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Sony and Kadokawa will collaborate on several projects, such as adapting the latter company's intellectual properties to live-action TV or cinema, co-producing new anime works, and expanding the publishing of Kadokawa's games.</p>
<p>Takeshi Natsuno, Chief Executive Officer of Kadokawa Corporation, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony. This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony’s support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximizing the value of our IP and increasing our corporate value in the mid-to-long term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market.</em></p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki, President, COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation, added:</p>
<p><em>Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of Kadokawa, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining Kadokawa’s extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize Kadokawa’s ‘Global Media Mix’ strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony’s long-term vision, ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.</em></p>
<p>Non-PlayStation gamers have been wary that this could mean FromSoftware's games would become exclusive to Sony's consoles, but this is doubtful. In all likelihood, the main goal of this collaboration is to adapt Kadokawa's franchises to other media.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/prey-remastered-luma-mod-adds-hdr-gtao-dlss-and-improves-a-boatload-of-other-things/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a new mod called Prey Remastered Luma that all fans of Arkane Austin's massively underrated game should check out. It was made by Filippo Tarpini, the Remedy developer who already worked on the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-mod-developed-by-remedy-programmer-adds-native-hdr-full-ultrawide-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control HDR/DLSS</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-luma-native-hdr-mod-released-by-all-star-modding-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Luma HDR</a> mods (the latter with the help of a larger team).</p>
<p>Despite the naming, Prey Luma actually has more in common with the former mod. That's basically, it doesn't just HDR; it introduces a lot more, such as support for NVIDIA DLSS and GTAO (Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion), and improves many graphics features such as Screen Space Reflections, Anisotropic Filtering, dynamic shadows, and more. The whole Prey Luma changelog can be found below; the mod can be downloaded via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prey2017/mods/149/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added HDR output (scRGB 16bit) with (improved tonemappin and rework of all post-processing effects</li>
<li>Increased buffers quality in SDR and HDR, reducing banding</li>
<li>Improved the quality of dynamic shadow, especially from up close</li>
<li>Added a more modern Ambient Occlusion solution (GTAO); the original AO is also improved in quality</li>
<li>Improved Screen Space Reflections</li>
<li>Added DLSS Super Resolution (on Nvidia GPUs) (OptiScaler can be used to inject FSR 3) (this looks drastically better than the native TAA and has no noticeable ghosting)</li>
<li>Added RCAS sharpening after TAA (replacing the original basic sharpening implementation)</li>
<li>Improved all the native Anti Aliasing implementations (e.g., SMAA and TAA)</li>
<li>Improved Anisotropic Filtering (it was not set to 16x on all textures that would benefit from it)</li>
<li>Improved quality and look of sun shaft effects and lens "optic" effects (e.g., lens flare)</li>
<li>Improved Motion Blur quality and fixes multiple issues with its motion vectors</li>
<li>Improved Bloom quality and fixes multiple issues with its generation (e.g., it was trailing at the edge of the screen)</li>
<li>Improved Ultrawide Aspect Ratio support (Bloom, AO, SSR, Sun Shafts, Lens Optics, etc. did not scale properly with it, causing the sun to be huge in UW or causing bloom and chromatic aberration to be stretched). Prey now also exposes the vertical Field of View instead of the horizontal one, which was limited to 120 and not Ultrawide friendly.</li>
<li>Improved High Resolution support (a multitude of effects did not scale properly to 4K like the object highlight overlay or stars/sun sprites)</li>
<li>Improved Dynamic Resolution Scaling support (Film Grain, Bloom, TAA, AO, SSR, Sun Shafts, Lens Optics, and many other effects did not scale properly with it)</li>
<li>Improved High Frame Rate support by unlocking the frame rate beyond 144 (you can change the limit in the menu now)</li>
<li>Improved Swapchain flip model (more responsive for VRR)</li>
<li>Added optional HDR post-process filter on pre-rendered videos</li>
<li>Added settings to turn off Vignette or Camera Motion Blur</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, with Arkane Austin gone, the likelihood of a new Prey game in that vein seems very low. However, thanks to this mod, PC players will be able to continue playing this game with enhanced visuals.</p>

			<p>For those who had the chance to play the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sword-and-fairy-7-is-the-latest-stunning-nvidia-rtx-graphical-showcase/">Sword and Fairy games</a> when they were younger, it has now been confirmed that Sword and Fairy 4 is being remade. This has been announced with a debut trailer, which showcases the game with new graphics, as the title has been made in Unreal Engine 5. The developers are using the latest technology to recreate the original Sword and Fairy 4 experience. At the moment, details about this game are very slim. However, it's known that the game will be available on console and PC in the future when it eventually releases.</p>
<p><iframe title="《仙劍奇俠傳四》重製版前導PV（繁中）" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hG4_GqYnKs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This title is being developed by Up Software and published by Cube Game. Again, it's relatively hard to find any information about these studios and their history in the game industry, as it will bring up a lot of irrelevant results on the search engine.</p>
<p>Sword and Fairy 4 is a single-player RPG that is "reborn" using Unreal Engine 5, where you get to go on a journey full of adventure and battle to try and find the immortals with Tianhe Yun's team. On this journey, a hidden truth that has managed to remain hidden away from the public is starting to unravel, with people finding out the truth.</p>
<p>Sword and Fairy as a franchise is the most famous Chinese RPG series, but outside of South East Asia, it's unlikely that you will have heard of it, as it's not widely available internationally. As a result, people have had to turn to emulation and YouTube videos or Twitch streams to see more of Sword and Fairy.</p>
<p>For South East Asian gamers, it's very clear that this franchise means a lot, especially to the Chinese audience. From the comments alone that you can translate via Google, a lot of people are overjoyed and incredibly emotional about the game being remade, showing that the game has had a lot of emotional impact on gamers over the years. Many of the comments even refer to the original game as a masterpiece, so it seems that players are in for a great experience.</p>
<p>As the entire trailer is in Chinese, it's uncertain at the moment whether this game will be available globally or just be accessible to the Asian audience. Minimal details about the game have been revealed, as this is the first sighting of the Sword and Fairy 4 Remake.</p>
<p>The original Sword and Fairy 4 game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621680/Sword_and_Fairy_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on Steam</a>, a title that was first released in 2007. However, if you want to play it, the game is only available in Chinese.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-comments-on-low-series-x-availability-in-poland/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-comments-on-low-series-x-availability-in-poland.1064928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-comments-on-low-series-x-availability-in-poland/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This week, several Polish websites <a href="https://www.gram.pl/news/microsoft-wycofuje-xboxy-w-polsce-konsola-stala-sie-niedostepna-w-sprzedazy#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Xbox Series X consoles were nowhere to be found in stores. These reports sparked rumors that Microsoft would essentially retire from selling the hardware in the European country.</p>
<p>We reached out to Microsoft and received the following comment from a spokesperson:</p>
<p><em>While we expect to have limited Xbox Series X supply in Poland this holiday due to player demand, Xbox Series S consoles will still be available. Players can visit <a href="http://xbox.com/regions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xbox.com/regions</a> to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
<p>Fans of the Green team have been increasingly antsy following Microsoft's big policy change around first-party games. More games are getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ported</a> to other consoles (chiefly Sony's PlayStation 5) right away, and there's a growing concern that this, coupled with the consistently low sales for the past couple of years, might eventually persuade Microsoft to just give up on its own console ecosystem and focus on making games for all platforms instead.</p>
<p>It does not seem like there's much to worry about on that front for the time being. At the same time, there's no guarantee that the situation will not change in the future.</p>
