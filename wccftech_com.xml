			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth may be about to get some new playable characters on PC, judging from a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@d3dnier398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D3DNieR</a>, shows the Turks Reno and Rude controlled by the player, complete with all of their abilities in their boss battles. Although it's clear that there's still more work to be done for a proper implementation, as Reno's voice doesn't work and every unique ability of the two characters doesn't require any ATB, both characters work remarkably well already, which is quite impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Playable Reno &amp; Rude Test | [REBIRTH]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tH2S9LnksUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following its release on PC earlier this year, plenty of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth have been released online, introducing improvements and new features not available in the vanilla game, such as the ability to increase the party size limit past three members and a<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/">dd temporary characters like Zack and Sephiroth to the party</a>, making them playable outside the small segments they are supposed to in the vanilla game. This party mod also allows players to add Cid and Vincent to the party, although the two characters aren't playable as they have no moveset, an issue that crashes the game whenever they are added to the frontline party.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has yet to be officially announced, but the work of a dedicated user is providing a better look at the unannounced remaster today.</p>
<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesIV4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JamesIV4</a> restored some of the <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/oblivion-remastered-dark-screenshots-restored-KscfaBJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshots</a> that leaked online <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">earlier this week</a>, which were considerably darker than others as they were likely intended as a backdrop for things like store pages or banners, as the user pointed out. Every location shown in the screenshots looks gorgeous in the restored images, but the night skybox in the Dock at night screenshot looks particularly impressive.</p>
<p>Following months of rumors and speculation, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was proven to be real earlier this week, when the aforementioned screenshots leaked online via the Virtuos official website. While there was no need for another confirmation that the game is real, mentions of the remaster have recently been discovered on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Bethesda website</a>, so all that is truly left is an official announcement and launch, which should happen sometime next week, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">multiple insiders.</a></p>
<p>2025 is going to be a remarkable year for fans of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, as fans will likely be able to experience a recreation of the game in Skyrim with the Skyblivion project, regardless of the launch of Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">Yesterday</a>, Skyblivion lead Rebelzize commented on how the official remaster will not impact the passion-fueled project as long as Bethesda allows it to exist.</p>

			<p>Atomfall surpassed Rebellion's expectations by far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-blows-past-2-million-players-in-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching over two million players in just one month</a>, and its presence on Game Pass was definitely helpful toward that goal. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley heaped praise on Microsoft and their subscription service:</p>
<p><em>It's been a huge success. Microsoft has been a fantastic partner to work with, they've really leaned in to helping us. They brought their skills and their scale to bear on our small project, and it's done really, really well for them, so they got a good deal, we got a good deal out of it as well.</em></p>
<p><em>With Game Pass, you can get people to try it, then as a result of those people trying it, they like it, and they then tell their mates on social media, 'I found this game on Game Pass, I really enjoyed it, you should have a go.' And then some of them are on Game Pass, and will play it. But some of them aren't on Game Pass, and will also want to be part of that conversation. So, they'll go and buy it. </em><em>At least, that's our theory – we don't have the data in for that. But Chris and I both feel, one of the biggest challenges for a company like us is discovery. And Game Pass has allowed for a lot of discovery for our game.</em></p>
<p><em>It does mitigate risk, because without going into details, they guarantee you a certain level of income, regardless of what it will sell for. But it potentially has a knock-on effect. Places like Xbox sales, for example. You could argue that all the hardcore are on Game Pass, and they're the ones that might buy a new IP like this, so therefore, are you cannibalising one section of the audience? And I think, perhaps, yes, a little bit. But what you gain from that cost is disproportionate.</em></p>
<p>Atomfall <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/801800/view/497192590186120441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just got a bug-fixing update</a> yesterday.

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Might Not Support VRR When Docked After All]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all.1166502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the biggest technical surprises when it comes to the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console was that it would support features like HDR (High Dynamic Range displays) and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate). However, as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by a ResetEra user</a>, any mention of VRR being available when setting the console in docked (or TV) mode has been removed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canadian</a> websites.</p>
<p>The description used to say:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR, VRR, and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>Now, though, it has been modified to:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-More-details-about-features-2790188.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British website</a> still features the original description, hence the confusion. Needless to say, we'll reach out to Nintendo to try and get clarification on the subject. It would be very underwhelming if docked mode truly lacked variable refresh rate, which would be critical for a smooth gameplay experience when playing at 4K on the console.</p>
<p>This does not affect handheld mode, which has built-in NVIDIA G-SYNC through a native DisplayPort 1.4 connection. The speculation is that variable refresh rate might be lost in the conversion from DisplayPort to the HDMI output needed for docked mode.</p>
<p>In other slightly weird Nintendo Switch 2 news, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild nor The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will support the cloud save backup feature</a> that is included with the Nintendo Switch Online premium membership. To clarify, it will still be possible to transfer saves from the original Nintendo Switch, but users won't be able to create new cloud saves in these versions.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World fans will want to tune in to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated Direct stream later today</a>.</p>
