			<p>An interesting new The Witcher 3 mod has recently appeared <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9426?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nexus</a> (<a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/new-the-witcher-3-dlc-sized-expansion-mod-adds-new-map-upgradeable-camp-and-unique-gameplay-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by DSO Gaming</a>). Created by Aeltoth, it is titled Wild Monster Hunt and it offers an alternative game mode inspired by CAPCOM's Monster Hunter series.</p>



<p>Wild Monster Hunt (WMH) allows you to start fresh playthroughs exclusively on WMH or join regular playthroughs to earn money. You get a camp that you can upgrade. It is similar to the Corvo Bianco home from the official Blood &amp; Wine DLC, but focuses more on providing advantages for monster hunting.<br>Aeltoth has created a big map, roughly the size of Toussaint. </p>



<p>Players will leave the camp to hunt monsters and complete procedurally generated contracts to earn gear and money. This allows them to craft better gear and hunt tougher targets. They can unlock new, unique items for expanded build crafting by using a special forge that is only available on this map.</p>

<p>Since Wild Monster Hunt is an alternate game mode, the default way to start a new playthrough is by selecting "New Game" from the menu of The Witcher 3 and choose the Wild Monster Hunt quick-start option. There's a chance this option may crash, so if it happens to you, the modder recommends using the other method.</p>



<p>You can also join the Wild Monster Hunt level from a new signpost located east of White Orchard village, past the bridge, and after the wooden tower with guards. Joining the Wild Monster Hunt level via this signpost will adjust the loot tables and mechanics to ensure the game mode doesn't interfere with the usual progression. Players may leave the mod's level by interacting with the fast travel signpost inside the camp.</p>



<p>Additionally, it is possible to enable optional challenges by interacting with the camp's noticeboard. For example, Merciless Path turns the mod into a sort of extraction game where gear is lost upon dying. The mod adjusts the rewards when this mode is enabled to accelerate progression.</p>

<p>In related news, The Witcher 3 developer CD Projekt RED has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed cross-platform mod support</a>, which is now expected to arrive at some point next year. Just like other cross-platform mod systems, it will be powered by mod.io.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio's release of the REDKit modding tool in May 2024</a>, there was a bit of a renaissance when it comes to mod projects. A big one is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-dlc-2026-the-last-wish-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last Wish Project</a>, which aims to recreate the original book written by Andrzej Sapkowski.</p>
