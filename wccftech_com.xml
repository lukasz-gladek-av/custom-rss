			<p>After <strong>Bethesda</strong> gave The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion the Unreal Engine 5 remaster treatment with <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered,</strong> according to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, both <strong>Fallout 3</strong> and <strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong> are due for the same treatment "<em>eventually</em>."</p>



<p>This isn't the first time we've had reports pointing to Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 getting some kind of remake/remaster treatment. This is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/">the second time in the span of the last few months</a> that Windows Central has claimed a remaster/remake similar to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is on its way for two of the most beloved Fallout games. </p>



<p>That said, Windows Central is not the only source for these claims. <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-fallout-3-remaster-hundreds-of-people-working-on/">Other outlets have reported</a> that these <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiple-fallout-projects-in-the-works-including-one-everyone-wants/">remasters/remakes are in development</a>, and considering the booming success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a>, and the commercial success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">it was one of the top 12 best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>), it feels like it's just a matter of time before Bethesda proves the rumours and reports to be correct with an official announcement.</p>



<p>"<em>Some have been wondering if a mysterious countdown on the Fallout TV show's Amazon Prime website is hinting at a shadow drop for a new Fallout game or remaster. I'm told that is not the case</em>," Corden writes. "<em>However, we are <strong>eventually</strong> getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein</em> <em>of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, as well as Fallout New Vegas on top</em>."</p>



<p>So while there's no apparent timeline for when these remasters/remakes will be announced and released, all signs point to them happening. Hopefully, we'll have some official announcements soon.</p>

			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">on December 17, 2025</a>, Splitgate developer <strong>1047 Games</strong> relaunched Splitgate 2 as <strong>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</strong>. The new title is meant to signify a fusion of the best of the first game and its maligned sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">after Splitgate 2's initial launch went terribly</a>, and 1047 Games co-founder <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">promised to "<em>make FPS great again</em>."</a></p>



<p>If you didn't know that Splitgate 2 had relaunched under its new moniker, or that it had relaunched at all, then don't worry; you're not alone. Arena Reloaded doesn't seem to have fared any better than Splitgate 2, at least according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max">its concurrent player numbers on SteamDB</a>. The game <strong>currently struggles to hit 1k concurrent players,</strong> and two days after some publications reported on those poor numbers, 1047 Games has taken it upon itself to respond.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982">In a statement posted to its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the caption reads, "<em>1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations</em>," almost like it was trying to write a headline for publications to use. The statement goes on to begin with, "<em>Steam Charts don't measure fun</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment. They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible. To our amazing community: thank you. Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day. And to everyone who hasn't</em> <em>played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been, and we'd love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The thing is, 1047 Games is absolutely right. It's not the best thing to get stuck in the weeds of SteamDB numbers when it comes to multi-platform games. Those numbers are only showing one platform, and we can't even take it as a proper read of PC players because Arena Reloaded is also available on the Epic Games Store. </p>



<p>Console platforms like PlayStation and Xbox don't share concurrent player numbers, so we can't really know how popular the game is outside of Steam. And SteamDB charts are only ever worth keeping an eye on when it comes to multiplayer games; they absolutely do not matter for single-player titles. </p>



<p>With all that said, if 1047 Games felt the need to make a statement like this, that can't be a sign that things are actually going fine internally when the team looks at its player numbers. If its numbers on Steam were low, but on consoles, it has thousands or even hundreds of thousands of players each day, then why care about chatter surrounding a platform that isn't the one your community is on? Some games are more popular on PC, while others are more popular on consoles.</p>



<p>So yes, SteamDB charts are never the full picture and anyone claiming that Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is dead in the water based solely on those numbers doesn't have all of the facts. But making a statement like this two days after initial reports of the low numbers seems more like an attempt to keep Splitgate in the news as much as possible, hoping more people will remember that it exists and give it a chance.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, of course, but if Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's concurrent player numbers on Steam are an accurate representation of how unpopular the game currently is, and the dire straits it is in, then that also feels like the exact kind of thing you would do if you were desperate for anyone to play your game.</p>



<p>Let us know below if we've got the situation completely wrong, and you're playing Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on your console or PC.</p>
