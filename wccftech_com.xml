			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=outworld+station">Outworld Station</a> is a new building sim from developer and publisher Trickjump Games that's now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3242950/Outworld_Station/">Steam</a> in early access. Step into the role of station commander and build out your space station, mining pretty much whatever you can get your hands on that'll help you expand your enterprise.</p>
<p>You'll be able to construct wormholes and use the power of antimatter to fulfill your goals, while also managing attacks from aliens, which you can do through expanding your empire further and by teaming up with other players in the 4-player PvE co-op mode.</p>
<p>A gameplay trailer from Trickjump Games shows off the impressive visuals from Outworld Station, which you can check out below.</p>

<p>Outworld Station puts players into the Tau system, where you'll be able to explore a number of planets and search for alien artefacts that can help you upgrade your technology and improve your station to assert your dominance in the Tau system further.</p>
<p>Trickjump Games is a UK-based studio founded in 2017, and this is the studio's third full release. The studio's most recent project before Outworld Station was a third-person action game called ArcRunner, which launched in 2023. Outworld Station is the team's first foray into a more strategy-simulation type game.</p>
