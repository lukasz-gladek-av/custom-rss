			<p>IO Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1953139116930986023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that 007 First Light has already surpassed 500K wishlists on Steam. It is the studio's fastest game to do so, beating their previous HITMAN games, though that's not very surprising when factoring in the power of the 007 IP.</p>



<p>As a reward to the community, IO Interactive revealed that the equippable Savanna Bloom skin will be available at release, and a series of animated wallpapers will be shared shortly. Furthermore, there are other 'missions' to complete if even more fans add the game to their wishlists ahead of the release:</p>



<ul>
<li>Milestone 2: Add flair to your fieldwork with a custom gadget skin, and stream like an agent with a bespoke overlay.</li>



<li>Milestone 3: Go in style with a Deluxe agent skin, plus unlock a developer AMA.</li>



<li>Milestone 4: Confidential. The contents of this final reward are top secret, for now…</li>
</ul>

<p>The title was <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2020 as Project 007. In late 2024, IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> it aims to create a 007 gaming franchise, specifically a 'big trilogy'. 007 First Light was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> during Sony's June 2025 State of Play, showing off a cinematic trailer.</p>



<p>Players will step into the shoes of a young, reckless, but already resourceful James Bond as he goes through MI6's training program. After a particularly heroic act, the young naval air crewman is offered a spot in the newly revived Double-O program. However, when a mission to stop a rogue agent goes tragically wrong, Bond must team up with his reluctant mentor, Greenway, to expose a deep conspiracy and prevent an impending coup at the heart of the British state.</p>



<p>In short, it is an origin story that includes the events that transformed an audacious young hero into the best MI6 agent. Players will go on missions in breathtaking locations, drive iconic vehicles, and dive into a cinematic adventure in pursuit of a rogue agent who’s always one step ahead.</p>



<p>Owing to IO Interactive's sandbox approach already seen with HITMAN, players will be able to choose their approach: go silent or go loud. They can fight with fists or firepower, use gadgets to infiltrate, or bluff their way past guards. Moreover, 007 First Light will allow them to replay the missions with additional modifiers.</p>



<p>The game is slated to launch in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
