			<p>Today, Techland <a href="https://youtu.be/CvqFjEILJao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> many announcements as part of its celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. Firstly, the numbers: over 45 million users have played either the first or the second game in the first-person open-world zombie series that originally debuted in 2015, an increase of 15 million since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-franchise-sold-30-million-copies-to-date-techland-busy-on-new-open-world-fantasy-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous announcement from two years ago</a>. During this decade, they have racked up 67 billion zombie kills and over 1 billion hours of total playtime.</p>
<p>To commemorate the tenth anniversary, the first and second games will feature a series of events over four weeks. In the first week, Dying Light will get HyperMode with a double XP bonus, while the sequel will enjoy the biggest discount ever (up to 67%, depending on the platform and region). In the following weeks, the original game will be refreshed with the Low Gravity, Super-Crane, and Viral Rush events, while Dying Light 2 players will be able to take advantage of new bounties via the Pilgrim Outpost website. In the fourth week, the sequel is also finally receiving the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower Raid cooperative roguelike mode</a> as a permanent addition to the game, following several playtest rounds.</p>

<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg revealed today for the franchise. The first Dying Light will soon receive a new patch that improves visuals and adds a remastered soundtrack with new music from the original composer Paweł Błaszczak. Of course, most of the content is coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a>, which is roughly in the middle of its promised five-year post-launch support. The updated roadmap for 2025 shows co-op gameplay and matchmaking improvements, new playable Tower Raid characters, improved Community Maps support, new firearms and melee weapons, an entirely new weapon class, improvements to the Prologue, graphical and technical improvements, and, of course, free gear and outfits.</p>

<p>That's still not everything Techland talked about today. The Polish developer confirmed they've got <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, which will mark the return of original game protagonist Kyle Crane, slated for the Summer season. Moreover, there are some unannounced Dying Light projects in the works, as well as new board games, exclusive merchandise, and an original webcomic series.</p>

			<p>Today, Hazelight released a new trailer for Split Fiction, a title that was announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-announced-at-the-game-awards-releases-march-6-2025/">The Game Awards</a>. This is the new game coming from the ambitious studio that made It Takes Two. This game is set to push the boundaries of a co-op adventure, where players can jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds while exploring their own side stories in a journey of discovery. If you want to see the new trailer for Split Fiction, you can find it down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Co-op Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you get glimpses into the story, Josef Fares, the founder of Hazelight walks you through the co-op scenarios that you can participate in and the varying gameplay that you'll get to experience. In addition to the co-op gameplay that you'll get to see in Split Fiction, the trailer also talks about a special feature called Side Stories. These are one-off adventures that you can do that are hidden throughout the main story levels, providing a shake-up to the mechanics and allowing you to learn more about the personalities and stories of Mio and Zoe.</p>
<p>As explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/an-introduction-to-side-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the EA website, Side Stories happen as a result of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation. The portals that appear are attempts to steal Mio and Zoe's unfinished stories from when they were younger. As a result, this leads to a lot of wacky situations that they will get to traverse together. These include riding Sandfish across a desert and performing tricks while under heavy fire. Others include becoming pigs and finding out how sausages are made. With these Side Stories, it's set to provide a lot of laughs and questionable moments as you get to explore the game.</p>
<p>Much like A Way Out and It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios' has promised that the Friend's Pass will be back for Split Fiction, too. This means that one player who owns the game can invite a friend to play the game for free. In addition, Hazelight also has plans to add crossplay, allowing friends to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 6, 2025. The game will be priced at $49.99.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/third-party-games-available-on-epic-games-store-on-mobile.1092975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/third-party-games-available-on-epic-games-store-on-mobile/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It was announced that the first batch of third-party games will be arriving on the Epic Games Store on mobile. So far, there are nearly 20 third-party games available on the client, with games like Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe now on Android worldwide and i<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/">OS in the European Union</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside the third-party games being added to the mobile version of the store, they have also announced the free games program on mobile, allowing those who want the opportunity to redeem their free game in the store and keep it forever. At the moment, Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee is available to obtain on Android and iOS through the Epic Games Store mobile app until February 20. Bloons TD 6 will also be added to the program. As they get underway, there will be new games offered each month, and they will eventually move to a weekly schedule later on in the year.</p>
<p>The catalog of third-party titles consists of games such as Evoland 2 and Blade of God X: Orisols, with games like Eastern Exorcist and Mr Rider coming in the near future.</p>
<p>While the new third-party games are the main focus of the announcement from Epic, they've also added some new app features for iOS and Android. This includes Epic Account login, with a persistent status across Epic's games on iOS and Android. For those who want to, they've also added a new auto-update feature, meaning you can jump into your games without having to wait for them to update.</p>
<p>Additionally, they've made some announcements for the developers out there who are considering using the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store to publish their titles</a>. Epic has confirmed that the terms they carry for the PC version of their app carry over to mobile, including the 88/12 revenue share for payments and 0% on third-party payments.</p>
<p>The Launch Everywhere with Epic program was recently released, where it offers a royalty rate reduction from 5% to 3.5% on all platforms and stores for eligible Unreal Engine games that are published on the Epic Games Store from 2025 onwards. In order to be eligible for this, the games must ship on the Epic Store before or at the same time it's released on other stores. By doing this, it's helping the developers maximize their profits from releasing the game and having its initial run in the Epic Games Store.</p>
