			<p>Since the previous sales milestone for Persona in March 2024, the series has gone on to sell a whopping 23.5 million copies across the globe, with the sales including both physical and digital. In March, it was reported that the Persona series had sold 22.6 million copies. This was announced shortly after the release of Persona 3 Reload, which sold more than one million copies in less than a week. The Persona series is continuing to expand and become more popular, as it was once considered a niche series. However, as announced in <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/library/printing_annual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sega's Annual Integrated Report</a> for 2024, the report now includes the updated cumulative sales for the most notable IPs for Sega. This, of course, included Persona.</p>
<p>In this report, Sega says that the fast sales growth for both the Persona and Like a Dragon franchise can be attributed to the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-annual-franchise/">the games</a> were released on multiple platforms, as well as simultaneous worldwide releases. Not only that but remasters and spin-off titles have helped the franchises exponentially. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, as for most gamers, Persona 5 and the other Persona 5 spin-offs really helped bring the franchise to the forefront and introduced people to the series as a whole.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the Persona 5 series alone sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Again, this is a statement that doesn't come as much of a surprise, especially considering how many games are in the Persona 5 series alone. In total, there are five titles in the Persona 5 series, with another game called Persona 5: The Phantom X due to be released in the near future. The Open Beta for this title began in April 2024, but there haven't been too many updates since then. Compared to the other games in the Persona 5 franchise, this one won't be as much of a mainstay as others, as only some of the original staff from the first Persona 5 game are working on this game, and it's marketed as a gacha game for the most part.</p>
<p>This year also saw the release of Persona 3 Reload, and then ATLUS branched out and created Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is a game that has a similar art style to that of Persona and has also done significantly well. Whether we'll see remakes of the original Persona games that started off the franchise remains to be seen, as we've seen some of the older games get ported to other platforms, like Persona 4 Golden, which was released last year.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like this franchise is going to continue to be massively successful for Sega and Atlus.</p>

			<p>With Grand Theft Auto VI, Rockstar Games has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior while offering players more freedom than before, according to a former developer of the game.</p>
<p>Speaking With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GTAVI-oclock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTAVIoclock</a>, former game designer at Rockstar Games, commented on the next entry in the open-world series launching next year, saying that the developer has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior, which will blow everyone away and will be talked about many years after launch. The former developer also talked about mission design, saying that it will be what makes the game good, granting players freedom. As for the current state of the game, Grand Theft Auto VI is in the bug-fixing phase, so hopefully, it won't take much longer to see more of it.</p>

<p>It has been almost a year since we last saw Grand Theft Auto VI, thanks to its official announcement trailer, which provided a very quick look at the two protagonists and the state of Leonida, where Vice City is located. Since then, Rockstar Games has been pretty silent about the game, leaving plenty of room for rumors and speculation regarding its precise release date, which hasn't slipped to 2026 as of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">September</a>, leaving fans plenty of time to put together documents going over everything that is currently known about what will be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time, according to analysts.</a></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It will be released sometime next year.</p>
