			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game confirmed to use NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch, despite the currently available footage not featuring any indication of the upscaler being used.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed they received official confirmation from CD Projekt RED that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-development-more-seven-weeks-the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2</a> uses a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. DLSS is reportedly used in all four display modes - docked Quality and Performance, and handheld Quality and Performance.</p>
<p>After having received confirmation, Digital Foundry went back to the footage available in the best possible quality to see if there's any clear indication of the upscaler being in use, but the low post-processing quality, which is at a lower resolution than the rest of the footage, makes it difficult to spot some of those DLSS "edges" that show the upscaler being in use, although some were still found upon a closer inspection of the footage.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Cyberpunk 2077 uses NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2, CD Projekt Red also confirmed that, while all modes target 1080p resolution, except for handheld Performance mode, which targets 720p, dynamic resolution scaling is in place, and the scaling can range from 2x and up per axis, meaning that we are looking at a 540p to 1080p range for the display modes targeting 1080p and a 360p to 720p range for Performance handheld.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most regions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

			<p>It looks like Assassin's Creed Shadows might be coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> in the not-too-distant future. The news comes directly from PEGI (Pan-European Game Information), the European rating regulator, which has <a href="https://pegi.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> a version for Nintendo's upcoming console. Of course, it could be a mistake, especially since the listing only appears in the 'most searched' tab and not when you actually search for the game.</p>
<p>However, chances are it's not. We know that Ubisoft has been a big supporter of Nintendo platforms ever since the original Switch. So far, for the Switch 2, they have just announced Star Wars Outlaws, which will be released on September 4 with all the DLC, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-dlc-arriving-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pirate's Fortune</a>, which launches next month on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>The main doubt surrounding the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows on the Nintendo Switch 2 would be of a technical nature. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is very advanced from a technical standpoint</a>. The latest iteration of the Anvil engine features virtual geometry, ray-traced global illumination, dynamic weather, wind, seasons, and destructible environments. However, it is that announcement of Star Wars Outlaws that should give fans hope. While Massive's game runs on a different engine, their own Snowdrop, it is just as advanced as Assassin's Creed Shadows, if not more so in certain areas. On PC, it's even more taxing than the latest Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 could run both games decently, it would be proof that it can punch above its weight class, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-good-job-ps4-visuals-enhancements-40-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to be</a> PlayStation 4-like with some enhancements here and there. Both of these games only run on the latest consoles by Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Assassin's Creed Shadows, the lineup of the upcoming console would get even richer. The game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> the second most successful launch after Valhalla, which launched during COVID, and critic reviews also rewarded Ubisoft Quebec's title accordingly. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 8.7/10 by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
