			<p>Halo Studios, the new name for the studio formerly known as 343 Industries, will reveal what's next for the Halo series in October 2025 at the Halo World Championship 2025 event.</p>



<p>In a blog post on the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june">Halo Waypoint website</a>, the team addressed that there have been rumors floating around about what's next for the series. The post doesn't single out any specific rumor, like the rumors about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Master Chief Collection</a> coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch 2, or that the next Halo game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/unrevealed-new-halo-game-could-launch-on-playstation-5-according-to-new-information/">release on PlayStation </a>alongside its Xbox and PC releases. </p>



<p>But it does confirm that it will be "<em>continuing the conversation</em>" it began at last year's HaloWC, where it announced Project Foundry, the team's switch to using Unreal Engine 5, and the studio name change from 343 Industries to Halo Studios. </p>

<div><p>"<em>Over the past few weeks, there's been a fair bit of speculation about when and where more details might emerge about any of the multiple projects Halo Studios is actively working on,</em>" the studio began. "<em>We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event</em>."</p><p>"<em>Last year at HaloWC,</em> <em>we premiered 'A New Dawn' where we talked about the switch to Unreal Engine, gave you a behind the scenes look at Project Foundry, and debuted our evolution to Halo Studios as we enter a new chapter for Halo. For us, 'A New Dawn' was just the beginning - at this year's HaloWC, we look forward to continuing the conversation.</em>"</p><p>"<em>Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship. We really hope you'll join us in Seattle this October!</em>"</p></div>



<div><p>The last major entry into the long-running shooter series was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/">Halo Infinite</a>, which was a mostly well-made game for all intents and purposes, but failed to take over the world in the same way new Halo games have done in the past. </p><p>Whatever Halo Studios has planned for the series, it is arguably the most important release for the Halo franchise yet. If it's not a success, it's worth asking whether Microsoft continues the series at all. That might feel like an insane thought, that Microsoft and Xbox would stop making Halo games. But a few short years ago, so did the idea that Microsoft would publish its first-party developed games on PlayStation and Nintendo devices. </p></div>
