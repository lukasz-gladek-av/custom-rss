			<p>Today, AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-official-200-games-supported-3x-performance-boost-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched its long awaited FSR Redstone update</a>, which includes FSR Upscaling (formerly known as FSR 4), FSR Frame Gen, FSR Ray Regeneration, and FSR Radiance Caching.</p>



<p>The first two are improved versions of previous technologies. The third one, Ray Regeneration, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-sees-an-unexpected-debut-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually already introduced by Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Developed in partnership with Microsoft, Ray Regeneration is a machine learning-powered denoiser that focuses on restoring details to ray traced effects, which can be troublesome in upscaled scenes. It is, essentially, AMD's version of NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</p>



<p>However, FSR Radiance Caching is not yet available in any game. During today's presentation, AMD showcased a tech demo of the feature in Warhammer 40K Darktide, Fatshark's first-person online action game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fatshark-presents-darktide-new-hive-scum-class-confirms-no-pvp-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just got the new Hive Scum class DLC</a>. Viewers assumed this meant Darktide would also be the first game to implement FSR Radiance Caching, but in a press release, the Swedish developer clarified that  the tech is 'experimental' and therefore not currently planned for release in Darktide's live build, as it requires 'further development, optimization, and quality verification before it could be integrated into a live service game.'</p>



<p>That said, Fatshark was eager to jump at the opportunity to develop the tech demo when AMD approached them about it this past Summer. Their Chief Technology Officer, Mikael Hansson, said in a statement: </p>



<p><em>Technology is meant to be built and shared together. Working with innovative powerhouses like AMD keeps us sharp, encourages diversification in game technology, and strengthens the entire industry. It’s fun, it’s challenging, and it’s a long-term investment, not just in Fatshark’s future, but in the future of gaming.</em></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-sdk-unreal-engine-plugin-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released FSR Redstone SDK</a>, AMD describes FSR Radiance Caching as a 'state-of-the-art illumination cache designed to work in tandem with Monte Carlo path tracing to boost rendering performance. At its core is an online machine learning model that continuously trains on complex, multi-bounce global illumination (GI) on-device and in real-time. The result is richer, more immersive lighting environments that respond dynamically without the need for pre-computation or baking.'</p>



<p>It sounds fairly similar to NVIDIA's RTX Neural Radiance Cache, another technique that <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aims to make path tracing faster with the help of machine learning</a> by inferring an infinite amount of bounces after the initial one or two bounces from path traced rays. RTX Neural Radiance Cache was released through the RTX Global Illumination SDK <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at CES 2025</a>, though it is only available in Portal with RTX so far.</p>

			<p>Across the board, the tech industry is currently still rattled by issues surrounding memory chip shortages. Companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/memory-shortages-are-so-terrible-that-samsung-is-shifting-hbm-production-towards-ddr5/">Samsung are making major shifts in their production lines,</a> and other companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/framework-announces-laptop-memory-upgrade-price-hike-but-insists-it-wont-overcharge-customers/">Framework have opted to directly tell consumers that prices will rise due to shortages</a>. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">Bloomberg</a> points to Nintendo losing $14 billion in share value as fears around memory shortages continue to rise.</p>



<p>Nintendo's shares have declined on almost every trading day in December so far, dropping to their lowest level since May 2025. According to the report (via <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/">TrendForce</a>), Nintendo now has to spend <strong>41% more</strong> on the 12GB RAM chips it uses to make Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. NAND storage prices also rose by <strong>8%</strong>, and with the drop in share value, the question quickly turns to 'when,' not 'if,' Nintendo will raise prices on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>And of course, it's not just the rising price of the console that's a concern. Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates told Bloomberg that Nintendo has already passed on the rising costs of memory chips to consumers through the cost of express microSD cards. "<em>The rise of NAND prices is starting to really impact express SD card prices. A 256GB express SD card costs $89.99 on Amazon. This is effectively a cost that Nintendo has passed on to the gamer</em>," said Smithers.</p>



<p>Of course, you don't need to buy an express microSD card for your Switch 2; you can try to make do with the console's built-in storage, but with the increasing number of developers turning to Game Key Card versions of their games for Switch 2 and the current landscape of digital games increasing in the amount of storage they consume, even the Switch 2's increased amount of internal storage compared to the original Switch doesn't go as far as it could for most players. </p>



<p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-players-trouble-finding-microsd-express-cards-microsd-shortages/">MicroSD Express Cards are simply getting more difficult to find</a> as these shortages continue, so while Smithers isn't wrong in pointing to the increase in their price as a total increase to the cost of buying a Switch 2, it may not factor in for some buyers simply because they can't find a MicroSD Express card to overpay on.</p>



<p>Smithers also claims that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">recent Black Friday sales for Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundles</a> were one of the seasonal sales "<em>surprises</em>," claiming, "<em>You wouldn't expect it [Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle] to be discounted this close to the holiday season</em>."</p>



<p>Sure, the Switch 2 was one of the best-selling consoles this Black Friday (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/">even though, at least in the EU, PS5 still claimed the top spot</a>), but there's concern it can keep up with its popularity, Black Friday discount or not, with its current stock and how much more expensive every single Switch 2 unit is to manufacture now.</p>



<p>Even with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa doing his best <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/">to reassure shareholders and consumers that the cost of the console will "<em>remain stable</em>" for the immediate future</a>, last month, that could quickly change in the new year, after the holiday season winds down.</p>

			<p>Despite the current questionable management of the brand, there's no denying that Xbox did some things right in the past. Chief among them is the backward compatibility program that makes select legacy games playable on current generation system, allowing more users to enjoy them without having to track old systems and copies of these games. In the future, Xbox backward compatibility could become even better, potentially expanding to Windows PCs and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/"><strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong></a>, if a rumored effort bears fruit.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-ronald-on-25th-anniversary-we-want-to-celebrate-the-legacy-of-xbox-as-well-as-define-the-future-of-where-the-xbox-ecosystem-is-going.1376665/post-148633819">Over on the ResetERA forums</a></strong>, reliable insider Nate the Hate, who consistently provides correct insider information, commented on the future of the Xbox ecosystem, suggesting that there's a chance backward compatibility could be expanded to more platforms.</p>



<p><em>"There exists a hope to make legacy Xbox (OG and Xbox 360) games BC on ROG and Windows. Whether they succeed is the unknown; but there is an effort being made," </em>the insider wrote. <em>"The other unknown would be how extensive will the initiative be in offerings. Will it be what we currently have on Series or will BC expand to add more titles across the Xbox ecosystem."</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first time we heard that legacy Xbox games could be coming to PC, but even if the effort is ongoing, there are many hurdles to overcome to accomplish this. One of the biggest issues that would prevent a larger library from being available on PC and the ROG Xbox Ally would be licensing issues, as reportedly, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">publishers are not willing to allow an Xbox game license to be converted into a PC game license.</a></strong></p>



<p>What seems almost certain at this point is that the next-generation Xbox, <span>rumored to be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-power-both-console-xbox-pcs/"><strong>AMD Magnus APU</strong></a>, will be&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/" target="_blank"><strong>backward compatible with previous-generation games.</strong></a>&nbsp;T</span>he above licensing issues wouldn't apply in this case, allowing legacy games to remain playable on a current gaming system.</p>



<p>Regardless of what Xbox has planned, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=266&amp;v=6Wl8G4k6FoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"><strong>news about the ecosystem will be shared in 2026</strong></a>, which will mark the 25th anniversary of the brand. As such, we may not have to wait much longer to learn if this ongoing effort will bear fruit, and legacy games will indeed become available on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a> may be the most significant game to come out of Embark Studios so far, but that doesn't mean the team has forgotten about its first-person, free-to-play shooter from 2023, The Finals. Today, Embark <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/900">is kicking off the game's third year</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-game-awards-shadow-drop/">it was shadow-dropped at The Game Awards 2023</a>, with Season 9: Dragon Rising, an update that Embark says is "<em>focused on growth, accessibility and renewed competitive momentum</em>."</p>



<p>With that focus, on top of Season 9 introducing a new megacity map called Fangwai City, a new battle pass, and several new quality of life and balance improvements - all things you might expect from a seasonal update - it's also introducing a new 8v8 gameplay mode, Point Break, and key updates to its ranked system.</p>



<p>Point Break is the clear highlight in Season 9, though not just because it's a new, bigger mode compared to other modes offered in The Finals. You may recall that <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/">Embark Studios was initially founded by former Battlefield developers</a> who wanted to return to a shooter that emphasized destructability in its matches, and to hear Embark describe the new mode in today's Season 9 reveal sounds like the team is getting back to their Battlefield roots in a way that makes sense for The Finals.</p>



<p>Point Break puts players as either attackers or defenders, with the lines of the battlefield constantly shifting, with attackers looking to destroy objectives that the defenders are charged with protecting. It's a large-scale game mode (well, large-scale for The Finals) that Embark describes as "<em>a mode where you always know where the action is headed, and what your team needs from you</em>," which could work just as well as a description for some game modes in Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SEASON 9 REVEAL PANEL | THE FINALS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwQlThIa4f8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Point Break, the new Fangwei City map, the extra optimization work done by Embark, and all of the other quality of life improvements Embark discusses in the video above really do hammer home the point that Embark is trying to inject some life back into The Finals. "<em>Season 9 isn't just new content, it's a stronger, more flexible version of The Finals, from top to bottom</em>," Embark says in its Season 9 reveal video.</p>



<p>And it couldn't have come at a better time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">with all eyes back on Embark thanks to ARC Raiders</a>. While SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, it still doesn't exactly look great to see that The Finals <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073850/charts/#max">hasn't had more than 50K concurrent players on Steam since January 2024</a>. While it's impressive that The Finals has been able to stick around long enough to reach its third year, which is more than can be said for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">some other recent free-to-play multiplayer first-person shooters</a>, it can't exactly continue to survive if its numbers don't start improving.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We'll see if Season 9: Dragon Rising is the adrenaline shot that the game needed, or if it's another whiff, bringing the game closer to its demise.</p>
