			<p>At the start of 2026, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> didn't just announce layoffs at one of its studios (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">which is how it started 2025</a>). It announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>,"</a> which included layoffs at multiple studios, the shuttering of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Ubisoft Halifax</a></strong>, the cancellation of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, and significant changes to its operating structure, alongside some unpopular new policies like a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">return-to-office mandate</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The response to these changes has not exactly been positive, both internally within Ubisoft and externally across the industry. On the stock market, the announcement of the restructure saw the company's stock price drop <strong>34%</strong>, which officially saw Ubisoft lose <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/"><strong>95% of its value</strong> in just eight years.</a> When this restructuring was followed by the introduction of a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">voluntary redundancy program</a></strong> at Ubisoft's headquarters in Paris, which aimed to cut as many as <strong>200 employees</strong>, employees decided they had had enough.</p>



<p>French union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong>, which represents several employees at Ubisoft Paris, announced plans for an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">international strike</a></strong>, calling on Ubisoft employees at branches across the globe to walk out and strike on <strong>February 10, 11, </strong>and <strong>12.</strong> Yesterday, February 10, 2026, was the first day of the strike, and according to Solidaires Informatique (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>), <strong>at least 1,200 Ubisoft employees walked out yesterday to participate in the strike.</strong></p>



<p>Most of the striking employees came from within France, with some of the striking workers also coming from the Milan branch. It's a strong show of force from Ubisoft employees, who have been calling out the company's leadership, specifically chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, as the responsible party for the studio's woes.</p>







<p>Employees are still on strike today, and will be for the remainder of the week. This is also not the only demonstration that has already happened, as former staff from the now-shuttered Halifax branch held a rally last month in response to their studio getting suddenly shut down.</p>



<p>Solidaires Informatique already hosted a smaller strike last month that it called an "<em></em><em>initial answer to the absurdity of management's decisions."</em> Solidaires Informatique representative, <strong>Marc Rutschlé</strong>, also added, "<em>At this state, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year. At the same time, the reorganization is creating a number of high-level positions with excessive salaries</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From our union's point of view, this forced reversal is a disguised redundancy plan, aimed at pushing employees outside the company. The atmosphere within the studio is particularly deplorable, with anger and despair reigning supreme. Staff representatives have witnessed several breakdowns in tears; some colleagues have made suicidal comments. If Guillemot wanted to make people miserable, he couldn't have done better</em>."</p>

			<p><strong>Arkheron</strong>, the interesting and ambitious blend between <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ai-first-pubg-publisher-krafton-reaches-all-time-high-2b-in-revenue/">PUBG</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-re-remastered-mod-new-version/">Dark Souls</a></strong> from <strong>Bonfire Studios</strong>, which we first <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkheron-is-an-ambitious-and-intriguing-mix-of-diablo-dark-souls-and-pubg/">got a look at last September</a>. It will have its first public playtest via the launch of a brand new demo arriving on <strong>February 20, 2026,</strong> just ahead of the first <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> of 2026, which will officially kick off three days later on February 23.</p>



<p>The news of the new demo also came along with a new trailer, where Bonfire Studios takes players through some of its plans for Arkheron as the team gets closer to launch, and some of the changes and updates players who've previously participated in the game's alpha playtest weekends will notice.</p>



<p>Introduced in the demo will be two new Eternal item sets that Bonfire will reveal just ahead of the demo's actual release, though with that also means two current sets players are already familiar with will be removed for the demo. They're not going away permanently; it's just a switch Bonfire is making for now, and since part of the fun in Arkheron is mixing and matching items and abilities to create more powerful characters, it's all part of Bonfire giving players as many options on how to play as possible.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The demo also arrives with a new patch for the game, version <strong>0.16,</strong> which adds a new tutorial, regional server selections, environmental updates and the ability to go back through your recent teammates if you want to keep playing with someone you randomly met through the game.</p>



<p>Once the demo goes live on February 20, players will be able to jump in 24/7 until <strong>March 2, 2026,</strong> when the demo goes offline. If Arkheron strikes you as something you want to keep playing, however, Bonfire is hosting another <strong>closed beta</strong> to help the studio further refine the game ahead of launch. The closed beta will introduce a ranked mode and will be focused on ensuring the game's competitive progression is finely tuned.</p>



<p>You will need to be sent a key to access the closed beta, so if you're enjoying Arkheron during Steam Next Fest, make sure to sign up for the closed beta to potentially participate in it.</p>

			<p><strong>MercurySteam</strong>, the developer behind the critically acclaimed 2D action game, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-dread-hunting-for-more/">Metroid Dread</a></strong>, followed up its beloved <strong>Nintendo-exclusive</strong> outing with something completely different last year. <strong>Blades of Fire</strong> was a new 3D action-adventure game that saw you take the role of <strong>Aran de Lira</strong>, the last blacksmith capable of wielding and forging true steel, who is tasked with killing the Queen to save humanity.</p>



<p>When it launched in May 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blades-of-fire-review-god-of-the-forge/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed it</a>, and despite it lacking in originality with its fantasy setting and narrative, he praised the weapon variety and forging mechanics, giving it an <strong>8.5/10</strong>. A crucial point on its launch, however, was that it was only available on PC as an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-gm-admits-steam-wont-be-toppled/">Epic Game Store</a></strong> exclusive. Now, developer MercurySteam has announced that it is finally making its arrival on <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2091020/Blades_of_Fire/">Steam</a></strong>, and it'll do so with a new and improved <strong>"<em>Version 2.0</em></strong>."</p>



<p>It'll arrive on Steam on <strong>May 14, 2026,</strong> and if you're keen to get your hands on it before then, you'll be to play a demo that's live <strong>right now</strong> to help celebrate its Steam release and to participate in <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong>, which is due to officially start in two weeks at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>As for what's new in Version 2.0, players will be able to dig into a new difficulty level called "<em>Titanium</em>" to really test their forging and fighting skills. Element transmutation has been added to allow players to change material types. There's a new photo mode, new game plus (which also includes new weapon parts and skins only available in NG+), and a new boss revival mode that lets you replay boss fights. Crucially, you can also now pet the Ox.</p>



<p>Outside of new gameplay additions, Version 2.0 also includes several technical updates and improvements, including adding support for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-sea-of-remnants-and-vampires-bloodlord-rising-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-with-multi-frame-generation/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a>,</strong> support for Steam Deck, new achievements and full key remapping for keyboard and mouse controls. The Steam version will also come with the game's original soundtrack and an artbook as part of the <strong>Adventure Pack</strong>, though anyone who owns the game on the Epic Games Store or consoles will have to grab the Adventure Pack separately.</p>
