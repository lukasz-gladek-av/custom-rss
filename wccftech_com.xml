			<p>Former <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Trials developers</a> in Finland came together to form a new studio called Channel37 back in 2021. Four years later, as of today, that studio has released its debut project, The Last Caretaker, in early access on PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>It's a survival building and crafting game where you step into the circuitry of a care-taking robot who wakes up to a world that is, quite literally, underwater. You go about waking up the ship you're on, and once your ship's engine is back up and running, the journey towards saving humanity begins, as you explore the vast ocean and hunt for the resources you need to improve your ship, and complete your ultimate goal: saving humanity.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Along with this early access launch, Channel37 revealed its roadmap for the game, which seems to hint towards the studio looking to get the 1.0 version of The Last Caretaker out sometime next year. Its first major update is coming before the end of this year, which will add new modules, night vision, a new node questline, warehouses, caves, and a basketball game. </p>



<p>Then in 2026, Channel37 has four major updates planned, one to start the year, two in the spring, and one in the summer. Assuming none of those updates get delayed, we could be looking at a release date for the 1.0 version of the game, aligning with its early access release date today.</p>

<p>"<em>We're delighted to share our vision with players, and are committed to the long-term future for The Last Caretaker</em>," said co-founder of Channel37, Antti Ilvesuo. "<em>We wanted to make a world that feels like it could exist; it's survival that makes sense. Sharing this roadmap now shows our intention, and we'll deliver all of this and more as we head toward full launch in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>Whether you grab The Last Caretaker on Steam or the Epic Games Store, make sure you have the latest graphics drivers, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/">NVIDIA confirmed it will support DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation and Super Resolution</a>. You can also play it through <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-add-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-anno-117-pax-romana-in-november-2025/">NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>, if you prefer.</p>

			<p>On the first GeForce NOW media blast of the month, NVIDIA has outlined the planned roadmap of PC games that will be added to the cloud gaming service throughout November 2025.</p>



<p>Chief among them is, without a doubt, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The game developed by Treyarch Software will be available from day one via GeForce NOW. Granted, its PC specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-trailer-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are definitely not too demanding</a>, and playing a competitive first-person shooter isn't something I would advise even with the latest upgrades brought by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new RTX 5080-class servers</a>, but having the option is always nice.</p>



<p>Other highlights include Anno 117: Pax Romana, Assetto Corsa Rally, Where Winds Meet, and Project Motor Racing. Here's the full list of PC games due to be added throughout November:</p>

<li>INAZUMA ELEVEN: Victory Road (New release on Steam, Nov. 10)</li>

<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assetto Corsa Rally</a> (New release on Steam, Nov. 13)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where Winds Meet</a> (New release on Epic Games Store, Nov. 14)</li>



<li>SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide (New release on Steam, Nov. 18)</li>



<li>Long Drive North (New release on Steam, Nov. 18)</li>

<li>The Last Caretaker (New release on Steam, Nov. 6)</li>



<li>Voidtrain (New release on Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, Nov. 7)</li>



<li>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage (Steam)</li>
</ul>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the most controversial entries in the series to date, and the massive backlash the game received not only threw Ubisoft off, but also had an impact on the game's development.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, during a meeting of video game industry insiders held last week at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft addressed the controversy surrounding the latest entry in the series, starting with a video that recapped how the game evolved into one that everyone loved to hate. At the end, the video revealed Ubisoft's approach to the controversy: it stopped focusing on the haters. This caused the game to be delayed for additional polish, as the publisher focused on appealing to the series fan that would, in turn, defend the game in the culture war that stemmed from its controversial choices.</p>



<p><em>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,"</em> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added after the short video ended. <em>"And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</em></p>



<p>If Ubisoft indeed managed to convincingly demonstrate that Assassin's Creed Shadows is more a game than a message, it's not yet clear at this moment, as no official sales data for the game has been provided by the publisher. It definitely seems to have done well at least in Europe, as it was reported back in August that the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">latest entry in the series was the best-selling new game of 2025 in Europe</a>, beating competition like Monster Hunter Wilds and Mario Kart World.</p>



<p>Although some of the controversies that surrounded the game before launch were justified, and the choice of protagonist and historical inaccuracies can be a turn-off, Assassin's Creed: Shadows is not a bad game at all. You can learn how it refines the formula of its RPG predecessors by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
