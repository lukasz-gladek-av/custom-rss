			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/bit-reactors-tactical-star-wars-game-star-wars-zero-company-will-be-revealed-this-saturday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to fans earlier this week, the upcoming turn-based tactics game STAR WARS Zero Company was revealed today during the Star Wars Celebration Japan event.</p>
<p>This is the game that Bit Reactor has been working on alongside Respawn Entertainment and Lucasfilm Games. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-2-officially-announced-alongside-two-new-star-wars-projects-from-respawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> alongside Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in early 2022. Bit Reactor was founded by former XCOM veterans led by Greg Foerstch, so it's no surprise that the game follows that design inspiration. Foerstch, CEO and Creative Director of the Maryland-based developer, said in a statement:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Our vision for STAR WARS Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay. It’s our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.</em></p>
<p>Douglas Reilly, GM &amp; VP at Lucasfilm Games, added:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>At Lucasfilm Games, we’re huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time. The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we’re confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to Star Wars.</em></p>
<p>In this game, players will step into the shoes of Hawks, a former Republic officer who must lead an elite squad of cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars. An unconventional team of hired guns from across the galaxy, the Zero Company must put aside their differences to overcome nearly impossible odds and take on an emerging threat that might consume the galaxy if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The campaign of STAR WARS Zero Company will task players with performing tactical operations and investigations across the galaxy. Between missions, they will establish a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of their enemies. Just as you'd expect in an XCOM-like title, there will be the freedom to create and customize your own squad of recruited operatives while meeting a cast of newly created Star Wars characters.</p>
<p>The main character's appearance and combat class can be fully customized, while recruited operatives can be personalized in appearance, load-outs, and abilities from a range of original Star Wars character classes and species, including Clone Troopers, Astromechs, and even a Jedi. In the field, the team will form bonds with each other to unlock powerful combat synergies that can turn the tide of battle. The developers promise high-stakes encounters that will require proper strategy to be overcome.</p>

<p>STAR WARS Zero Company is set to launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Wishlisting is already available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2075800/STAR_WARS_Zero_Company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
