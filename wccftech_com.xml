			<p>The unofficial Skyrim Unreal Engine 5.5 remaster brings significant visual improvements over the original using Lumen and Nanite, but at a considerable performance cost even on a powerful GPU like the RTX 4080.</p>
<p>A new comparison video put together by MxBenchmarkPC puts the fan-made remaster and the original side by side, highlighting how much hardware Lumen and Nanite improve the game's visuals while leaving the original assets intact. The visual improvements, however, bring a significant impact on performance, often in the 100+ FPS range on an RTX 4080, which isn't all that surprising, considering how demanding Lumen can be and how the unofficial remaster is only a demo so far that has likely not been optimized.</p>

<p>In case you are afraid of stressing your system out a bit to check how Skyrim has been recreated in the latest version of Unreal Engine 5, you can download the demo <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1neuhForpjGF_wAyD8Hdox3iQZA-DYvSU/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Despite having been originally released well over ten years ago, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim continues to be an extremely popular game, also thanks to the modding community, which is still extremely active today. The latest official version of the game is the Anniversary Edition, which was launched back in 2011 to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary with new content and gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>While an official Skyrim remake is nowhere on the horizon, we will soon be able to return to one of Tamriel's regions, Cyrodiil, thanks to a yet-to-be-announced remake of Oblivion. This remake, rumored to be in the works at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Virtuos</a>, will not only improve the original game's visuals using Unreal Engine 5 but also reportedly introduce plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">gameplay tweaks and changes.</a></p>
