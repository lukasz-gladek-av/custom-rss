			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director recently apologized for the difficult Platinum Trophy of the game, vowing to never make another so difficult in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-34152657">Daily Star</a>, director Naoki Hamaguchi discussed the difficult Platinum Trophy, which requires multiple playthroughs of the game and completing mini-games at hard difficulty. He apologized for how difficult it is to unlock and assured that he would never make one so difficult to obtain again, so trophy hunters should have far fewer problems mastering the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project.</p>
<p>To Daily Star, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi also <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-wont-34152228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> how the game won't be getting any DLC to have the sequel out as soon as possible and how the third entry in the series is likely to shake up the formula of the second game in the Remake trilogy, as he wants to add a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/">different twist for a new and exciting experience</a>. This new experience will likely involve the Highwind airship, as the team is fully committed to delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">freely explorable map using the airship.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5, and it is played best on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> until the game finally hits PC on a yet-to-be-confirmed date. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Today, GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859930792564285907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>via social media that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already sold one million copies, and 'many more' have joined the Zone via Game Pass. It's not entirely unsurprising given the massive amount of hype (and Steam wishlists) the game had garnered over the years.</p>
<p>It's probably not nearly enough to recoup the development costs, though. GSC Game World told me during <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 chat</a> that the studio was massive, with over 430 employees working on STALKER 2. The social media blast also claimed this was only the beginning, and indeed, on launch day, GSC Game World wrote an open letter to fans acknowledging the game's rough edges outlined in reviews.</p>
<p><em>There are so many things in the game that we are incredibly proud of. Nevertheless, STALKER 2 is a massive game. We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven't released anything of this scale before. We're absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention. In the first days after release, we'll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can. Then, we'll switch to larger updates that include constant improvements. There will also be free in-game content â€” we'll share its roadmap later in December. We have big plans for the STALKER universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.</em></p>
<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> that features like hardware ray tracing, mod tools to make cross-platform mods and even multiplayer modes will be released after launch. The Ultimate Edition of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl also includes access to the Season Pass, which is already guaranteed to add at least two expansions to the game at some point in the future.</p>

			<p>A new Silent Hill 2 patch is now live on PC and PlayStation 5, addressing some PS5 Pro-specific issues and much more.</p>
<p>The 1.06 patch focuses on fixing various issues on both platforms, including the widely reported visual glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro. Other PlayStation 5-specific fixes include audio, map and blocker fixes, boss animations, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch also addresses many issues on PC, including the interference between saving a game and properly performing vibrations on the controllers, improved mouse sensibility and mouse input, and more. The full patch notes are available on Konami's <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/eu/en/update_106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>
<p>Despite some issues here and there, developer Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking Silent Hill 2, developing their best game to date. You can learn more about it by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Blizzard Entertainment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRgtN1sMf6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted</a> a Campfire Chat with Diablo IV developers to discuss the upcoming 2.1 patch that will go live on the Public Test Realm between December 3 and 10, exclusively on PC's Battle.net.</p>
<p>The team talked about the main features and new content that will be in the new update, starting with the long-awaited Armory feature, which allows players to save and switch between different builds easily without any respeccing costs. With the Armory, Blizzard seeks to improve player flexibility in the endgame content. They noted that controller support for the feature would not be available right away, though. Worries about accidentally selling items saved in the Armory were put to rest, too, with the developers assuring players that saved items will be favorited automatically to prevent any accidental sales. They will also have an icon indicating they are part of a saved build.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other highlight of Diablo IV Patch 2.1 is the new system based on Witchcraft powers. Players will engage with witches around the Tree of Whispers, offering a new currency called Restless Rot (earned after defeating the new Headrotten enemies) at altars to learn new witchcraft abilities through a streamlined menu system. The season also introduces a reputation system called Covens Favor for unlocking rewards, including new witchcraft powers. Additionally, players can discover lost powers by finding Forgotten Altars in the world. Over 20 powers will be available, with popular options like the poison frog summon, Doom orb, and vengeful servant. Another Witchcraft Power called Pano sucks enemies into a swirling vortex of destruction.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players will find Headrotten enemies through the new seasonal activity called Headhunts, earning the new Occult Gems as rewards. These gems are special socketables that boost defense and provide unique effects to fine-tune player builds. The developers showcased examples of occult gems like Elder Sigil, Killing Wind, and Dust Stone, each offering different bonuses based on player preferences and playstyle. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements have been made to the town around the Tree of Whispers, adding more services and streamlining navigation to enhance the player experience during Headhunts. Of course, Diablo IV Patch 2.1 will also come with a plethora of class changes and overhauls. The full patch notes will be released on Wednesday, November 27.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-was-at-some-point-a-roguelike-game-with-arkham-like-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented </a>with making this game a roguelike with Arkham-like combat early in development?</p>
