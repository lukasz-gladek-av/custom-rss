			<p>Lunar Software's long-awaited horror game ROUTINE is finally out and on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One devices, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">even for a game that was announced more than a decade ago</a>, it has the sensibilities of a game older than that. Needless to say, there are a few things you'll want to know when jumping into it yourself.</p>



<p>This guide will take you through a few essential tips and tricks to ensure you can see everything ROUTINE has to offer, without getting terribly lost.</p>



<h2 id="h-routine-tips-and-tricks-guide">ROUTINE Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-have-a-notebook-ready">Have a notebook ready</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.11.27-23.07.22.86.png"></a><figcaption><em>Just like any good astronaut, you'll want to keep a record of what happens on the moon in ROUTINE.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't give you waypoints, map markers, or a compass to tell you which direction you're going in. It doesn't even give you a map to look at. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, it's the second game in 2025 to make getting around its environment and figuring out where to go next is a constant puzzle, which is part of the game's draw, as you're constantly building a mental map of each area.</p>



<p>You can do that, or you can draw a map of the space in a notebook to help you get around. That could be reason enough to have a notebook ready, but the better reason to have a notebook and pen beside you - or something to take notes with at least - is all the code puzzles you'll need to solve.</p>



<p>Having a notebook to write down every code you uncover is probably the best thing you can do to make sure you have a smooth time with ROUTINE. Instead of risking a moment where you've successfully made it to where you need to enter the code you just solved, and you have to backtrack to where you solved it because you can't remember the code.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-c-a-t-is-everything-but-it-s-got-nothing-on-plain-old-hiding">Your C.A.T. is everything, but it's got nothing on plain-old hiding</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_005_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>Your C.A.T. is useful, but it can't do everything.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your only tool and the one thing that lets you communicate with the abandoned lunar base, your C.A.T. (Cosmonaut Assistance Tool), is pretty much your everything in ROUTINE. It's how you save when you find a save point; it's how you scan your environment for otherwise invisible writings that reveal secrets and help you solve puzzles, and it's how you fight back against the robots trying to kill you.</p>



<p>But fighting back will only get you so far. Whoever made these robots made them to last, and while two electric shots from your C.A.T. directly into a robot's chest in short succession can stun them, no amount of shots will actually take them down. Stunning them can give you a window to run and hide, but running and hiding is always going to be what actually gets them off your back, and the chance to progress further in the story.</p>



<h3 id="h-not-every-robot-is-trying-to-kill-you-at-the-same-time">Not every robot is trying to kill you - at the same time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_004_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the many things not directly explained to you in ROUTINE is that while you'll see plenty of killer robots on the base, they aren't all trying to kill you - at the same time. No more than one robot is activated at any time, so as you start learning where the robots are in the rooms you're exploring, if you know which one is active, you can walk right by another with no fear.</p>



<p>Unless, of course, it activates right in front of you. In that case, you might be screwed if you can't run away in time.</p>



<h3 id="h-there-are-safe-rooms-but-no-safe-pausing">There are safe rooms, but no safe pausing</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.02-02.47.05.85.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sometimes, these access points that allow you to save are in 'safe rooms,' but not all the time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-finally-gets-first-combat-footage-but-leon-is-nowhere-to-be-seen/">Capcom's Resident Evil series</a> is known for its safe rooms, the areas you reach where any of the horrors you're shooting at can't get to you. They're accompanied by their own music and a few repeating hallmarks so that when you find one, you know you can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't have safe rooms in the same way Resident Evil has safe rooms, but they are there. You just have to look closely. What you can't do is pause the game and think you're safe.</p>



<p>All pressing the pause button does is bring up the game's menu; you can still die if you pause and leave yourself directly in the patrol path of a robot. So if you do need to adjust something in the menu, or step away for a moment, make sure you're actually safe before doing so.</p>



<h3 id="h-really-look-around-and-then-look-again">Really look around, and then look again</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.01-02.16.42.25.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE forces you to slow down and pay attention to your environment, so don't start to panic if you're having trouble finding your way.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As stated earlier, ROUTINE doesn't include any of the modern gaming comforts, like an in-game map. Figuring out where to go means you have to look around you and see what the environment is telling you.</p>



<p>That setup can, and probably will, make it easy for you to feel like you're lost. But Lunar Software's limitations on what kind of assistance you get means that you only have to look in a few places to figure out where to go next.</p>



<p>While some chapters include bouncing between different areas on different floors, most of ROUTINE will involve you navigating a large section of the base connected with hallways and, in some cases, through vents and backdoor entrances. If you really feel lost, keep looking around and zoom in on everything you see. Taking your time to do this will likely result in you figuring out where to go faster than if you tried to speed to the answer.</p>

			<p>Tim Cain, the veteran game designer known primarily as the original creator of Fallout, has returned to work at Obsidian Entertainment in a full-time capacity.</p>



<p>The announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came from his personal YouTube channel</a>, where Cain regularly posts videos about the games industry as a whole. The Fallout creator had gone into 'semi-retirement' in June 2020, after nine years as a full-time employee of Obsidian, during which he worked on South Park: The Stick of Truth, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyranny</a> as a programmer, and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a> as its co-director alongside Leonard Boyarsky (whom he previously worked with on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines). Cain also contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which launched just two months ago, but only as a creative consultant.</p>



<p>Now, however, it seems like his early retirement is over, and he's also moved back to Southern California to work in-person at the studio:</p>



<p><em>I should point out that I'm back at Obsidian. I'm their full-time employee and in person, so not remote. I'm not a contractor anymore. This means that I'm not working in other places, although there's at least one game that I worked on that I know is going to ship. I don't know if it'll be next year or the year after, but a game's going to come out that's not an Obsidian game. They'll have my name in the credits because I did work for it for it. There are other games I worked on. I'm not sure they're going to ship. The 2020 to 2025 was a weird time in the industry and a lot of games got started and a lot of games got cancelled. So, I really don't know the status of all the games that I contracted on.</em></p>



<p><em>I also can't talk about the project I'm working on at Obsidian just because, you know, that's covered under NDA. Don't bother guessing. You're not going to guess right.</em></p>



<p>A recent rumor shared by former Obsidian founder Chris Avellone <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-2-but-not-the-outer-worlds-3-reportedly-in-the-making-at-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the studio may not be planning to make a new The Outer Worlds entry, at least for now. That, coupled with the return of Cain, is more than enough to get Fallout: New Vegas fans hyped about the possibility of seeing him team up once more with Leonard Boyarsky (who also worked on the first two Fallout titles) on New Vegas 2 or another Fallout spin-off. However, Cain's tease that fans won't guess right appears to be a nudge that the project is actually a new IP.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it's certainly great news that such an esteemed RPG designer, whose credits also include cult classics like Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura and The Temple of Elemental Evil (which is about to be re-released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3843520/The_Temple_of_Elemental_Evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, by the way), is back at work on new projects. Obsidian has the ambitious goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-wont-chase-huge-profits-or-grow-aggressively-plans-to-last-100-years-in-the-rpg-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to make great RPGs for the next 100 years</a> without chasing big profits or turning into a massive studio, and Cain's presence will help keep them on the right course.</p>



<p>The team is also looking to satisfy people's hunger for deeper RPGs, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/players-want-deeper-rpgs-says-the-outer-worlds-2-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while ago by the director of The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and the return of the original Fallout creator will undoubtedly be a boon to that end.</p>
