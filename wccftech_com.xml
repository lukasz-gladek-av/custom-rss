			<p>The first version of the Dark Souls Remastered Seamless Co-op mod is now available for download, allowing PC players to enjoy the entirety of the game together with other players with little to no restrictions.</p>
<p>The mod, developed by Yui, the same developer behind the Seamless Co-op for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-seamless-co-op-mod/">Dark Souls 3</a>, overhauls the multiplayer component of the vanilla game, allowing up to five players to enjoy the entirety of the game together, removing fog walls and barriers that limit the co-op multiplayer experience of the vanilla game and making game progression and world state sync for all players in a session. To make the experience more enjoyable, the mod also introduces some balance changes with enemy scaling extended to all enemies, unlike the vanilla game, which only has it for bosses, and some quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to rejoin the session's host from anywhere in the game's world and light sources created by one player in the session becoming available for all players. You can download the mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/899?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and see it in action in the video below.</p>

			<p>The beta version of an impressive Devil May Cry 3 overhaul mod called Crimson will be released next month, introducing many features and improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remake.</p>
<p>The release date for the mod's beta, May 13th, was announced with a five-minute-long trailer that goes over the many improvements it will bring to the PC version of the third entry in the series, such as inertia for aerial combat, which will allow players to create intricate movement-based combos, Guardfly, a unique mechanic that allows Dante to fly all over the screen using some unique properties of the Royal Guard's Guard abilities while in the air like in Devil May Cry 4, increased jump cancel hitboxes for better jump canceling, increased enemy juggle time, revamped HUD, and a weapon wheel and on-the-fly style switching, similar to those introduced in the Nintendo Switch port of the game's Special Edition released a while back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Devil May Cry 3 Crimson - Beta Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cEVPo9wxjeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/">latest entry in the series</a> having been released a few years back, the Devil May Cry series got into the spotlight once again this month thanks to the release of the Netflix animated show, which has been confirmed to have been renewed for <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910332636712608222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a second season</a>. Unfortunately, with series long-time director Hideaki Itsuno having left CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">last year </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-creator-hideaki-itsuno-joins-tencents-lightspeed-to-work-on-aaa-action-games/">to join Tencent's LightSpeed</a>, the future of the franchise is uncertain, but hopefully, the success of the animated show will convince the publisher to continue the series even without Itsuno-san's involvement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-early-ad-shows-gorgeous-visuals-summer-2025-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that Mafia: The Old Country would launch this Summer. Now, though, we have a semi-official release date: August 8.</p>
<p>The info briefly appeared in a Steam post that announced a developer panel due to take place at PAX East. On May 8 at 7 PM BST (2 PM ET), Hangar 13 developers will debut a new gameplay trailer and provide a behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of the franchise. During the panel, the studio will provide an in-depth look back at the last 23 years of Mafia, insight into how Hangar 13 brought the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily to life in Unreal Engine 5 for Mafia: The Old Country, a Q&amp;A session and more development insights. Studio President Nick Baynes, Game Director Alex Cox, and Cinematics Director Tomas Hrebicek will be there to attend and reply to several questions, including some taken from the community.&nbsp; Any mention of the launch date was quickly amended, but nothing escapes fans these days.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024, slightly less than a year before its planned release date. As hinted by the title, it will be set in Sicily. The goal is to dive into the criminal organization's origins, dating back to the early 1900s. Players will step into the role of Enzo Favara, who survived a childhood of forced labor and is now all too eager to prove himself to Cosa Nostra and, specifically, Don Torrisi's family.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> by Hangar 13, the game will be a linear, narrative-driven action/adventure grounded in authentic realism. Combat will include melee fights with blades and ranged engagements with firearms. In certain segments, Enzo will use horses and even early motorcars. Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and certainly looks the part, although we don't have any info on the system requirements yet.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-xbox-steam-launch-march-2023-arenas-mode/">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap has announced that its new soccer game, Rematch, will launch on <strong>July 19, 2025</strong>, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass when it launches.</p>
<p>Rematch was first shown during <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and it definitely wasn't what players would have expected to be Sloclap's next game after Sifu. Sloclap has brought its brand of close-up action to the beautiful game, and the trailer that Sloclap showed off today during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase further shows how this will probably be unlike any other soccer game currently on the market.</p>
<p>Rematch features 4v4 and 5v5 matches for players to showcase their soccer skills. If you're especially keen to give Rematch a try, Sloclap also announced today that there will be an open beta test for the game in a little more than a week from the time of writing. The beta test will run from April 18-19 and will be available to PC players on Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rematch - Release Date Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsItvQSNjLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can sign up for the beta test by visiting the game's <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/">official website here</a>. If you're already sure you'll be buying Rematch, you can also pre-order one of the game's three editions, ranging from $29.99 USD for just the base game to $49.99 for the 'Elite Edition.' Buying either of the two top-end editions of Rematch grants you 72 hours of early access to Rematch, battle pass rewards, and a few in-game cosmetics to show off in multiplayer matches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-editions-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be home to plenty of original experiences, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, but a core part of the system’s early lineup will be “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” versions of Switch titles. These will include upcoming games that will launch simultaneously on Switch 1 and 2, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, as well as a handful of upgrades to older Switch titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>I recently went hands-on with a number of these new editions at a Nintendo Switch 2 preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can check out my general impressions of the hardware here</a>). I’ve already <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chimed in on the Switch 2 version of Metroid Prime 4</a>, but here’s a roundup of my thoughts on the various Switch 2 Editions of older titles. Are these editions a worthy upgrade or underwhelming? Scroll on for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions2.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</strong></h2>
<p>Both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom were said to run at 4K and 60fps by Nintendo reps at the hands-on event, although I suspect some sort of uprezing was going on, as they didn’t look <em>quite </em>as crisp as some of the other Switch 2 Edition titles I played at the event. Some assets didn’t look as sharp as they could have and shadows had quite obvious jagged edges. Of course, that can naturally come from uprezing a game that, in the case of BotW, is over eight years old at this point.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Make no mistake, the games <em>did </em>look much better than on the OG Switch, and the bump in performance was very welcome given both BotW and TotK struggled fairly significantly to maintain even a solid 30fps on the older hardware. Being able to run through Kakariko Village at a solid 60fps after all these years was certainly a cathartic experience. The new versions of Zelda BotW and TotK also support Zelda Notes, a service available through the Nintendo Switch App that provides additional maps, hints, the ability to share items between the two games, and more. As a generally app-adverse person, I don’t know if this will be something I bother with all that much, but I could see it being useful for some.</p>
<p>Overall, the Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are nice to have, and will undoubtedly become my preferred way to play the games, but neither felt quite as transformative as I was hoping.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions4.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</strong></h2>
<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition updates one of the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminally-underappreciated games on the Switch</a>, and it actually delivers one of the most notable upgrades of the early bunch of Switch 2 Editions. To my eye, the visuals looked sharper than either Zelda game, perhaps indicating Kirby is closer to a native 4K than they are. While the original Forgotten Land was a mostly-solid 30fps, the 60fps boost is noticeable and welcome.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In another departure from the Zelda updates, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is also getting new content in the form of the Star-Crossed World expansion. This largely seems to be a remix of the original Forgotten World, with blue crystal stars raining down and changing up stages. Rather than Waddle Dees, Kirby is now rescuing strange new creatures called “Starries,” while also grabbing new star-like collectibles. Smashing larger crystals will make new crystalline platforms and structures appear, altering stage layouts and making enemies more challenging. There are also some completely new features, including added Mouthful Mode transformations (I got to try out the bouncy new Spring ability). While Star-Crossed World isn't a completely original creation, it felt just as fun as the original Forgotten Land and it seems like it may be quite a substantial add-on, remixing many, if not all, of the original game's stages.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions6.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</strong></h2>
<p>The demos for Super Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition were less about the visual and technical upgrades, and more about gameplay additions that show off the Switch 2’s new control options and accessories. I had the chance to try out a number of new minigames built around mouse controls that had me doing things like guiding toads through an electrified maze and spray painting bob-ombs. Most of these games were pretty fun. The new Jamboree TV expansion mostly focuses on using the new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera to insert yourself into games, which felt more gimmicky and less appealing to me.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions7.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Games</strong></h2>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games demoed at the recent hands-on event weren’t just one thing, running the gamut from technically impressive but perhaps not essential (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom) to a quirky controller and accessory showcase (Super Mario Party Jamboree) to what seems to be a fairly significant content expansion (Kirby and the Forgotten Land).</p>
<p>We also have to take into account cost when we talk about these Switch 2 upgrades, which Nintendo is being slightly opaque about. They have revealed the Zelda updates will cost $10 apiece if you own the original Switch games, although you can get both for “free” if you’re a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriber. If you don’t own the original games, you can buy Switch 2 Editions that will cost as much as the original game plus the upgrade pack (so, $70 for BotW and $80 for TotK). Pricing for the Kirby and Mario Party upgrades that actually add new content hasn’t been revealed, but <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kirby-and-The-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-U-S-Version/15949615341?classType=REGULAR&amp;nrtv_cid=pvlmg302wxpjg&amp;clickid=32BXElxE9xycUPHyS11FHUJPUksy%3AMzkewu5Vk0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_32BXElxE9xycUPHyS11FHUJPUksy%3AMzkewu5Vk0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_376373&amp;affiliates_ad_id=565706&amp;campaign_id=9383&amp;sharedid=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store listings hint they’ll cost more</a> – up to $20 for the upgrade and $80 if you’re getting the original game + upgrade bundle.</p>
<p>Of course, I need to play more, but these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions seem like a solid deal if you already own the original Switch titles, but may be a bit rich for the blood of folks that also need to buy the base game. All the Switch 2 Edition titles I played seemed worthwhile to some degree, and some, particularly Kirby and the Forgotten Land, were quite intriguing, but you’ll have to pick and choose which ones are worth it for you (or get that NSO+ subscription, assuming all the updates will be available through the service). Your mileage with these makeovers may vary.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom launch alongside the system on June 5. Meanwhile, Super Mario Party Jamboree arrives on July 24 and Kirby and the Forgotten Land is coming August 28. Look for more Wccftech coverage of these upgrades closer to launch.</p>
