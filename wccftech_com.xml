			<p>Although its popularity doesn't reach the heights of other established series like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">Dragon Quest</a>, the Octopath Traveler franchise is proving to be rather seminal for the JRPG genre as a whole, mainly thanks to its HD-2D visual style which has been employed to great success in other titles, including the tactical role-playing game Triangle Strategy, the upcoming action role-playing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-new-trailers-drop-ahead-of-tgs/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, and remakes of classic games such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">first three entries in the Dragon Quest series</a> and in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-ocean-the-second-story-r-far-beyond-the-stars/">Star Ocean: The Second Story R</a>, remake of the second entry in the series created by tri-Ace.</p>



<p>The HD-2D style, which combines 2D sprites with 3D environments bridged together with pixel-art aesthetics, also made its debut a few years back on mobile platforms with Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a free-to-play RPG set in the world of the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-eights-great/">first entry in the series</a>, which also serves as its prequel. This mobile game is also the basis upon which Octopath Traveler 0 has been built to deliver some of its features and story, as well as gameplay that's closer to the first two entries in the franchise.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251122133018_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Octopath Traveler 0 features one of the best stories in the entire series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike the first two entries in the series, Octopath Traveler 0 doesn't feature eight different protagonists with their own individual stories, which sort of blend together in the final act, but a single protagonist. This player-created protagonist, whose appearance, Job, and more can be customized before the start of the game, is a resident of Wishvale, a town in the continent of Orsterra which is burned down during the town's annual festival by three nefarious individuals - the witch Hermania, the hero Tytos and the playwright Auguste - in the bid to acquire Aelfric's Ring, an artifact of immense power related to the Flamebringer said to have concluded the war between the twelve other gods and Galdera, saving the world, over one thousand years before the events of the game which fatefully made its way into the hands of the new Ringbearer.</p>



<p>Sometime after the destruction of Wishvale, however, the Firebringer emerges from hiding and together with another survivor of the fire, the apprentice architect Stia, sets out to restore the village, rounding up any other survivor scattered all over Orsterra, setting out to find new people to populate the place and take revenge on the villains that have reduced Wishvale to ash.</p>



<p>Although the Octopath Traveler 0 story moves on two somewhat distinct directions - the Wishvale restoration and the revenge directions - it is a much more focused effort than previous entries in the series, which I felt suffered not only from excessive fragmentation, but also uneven quality between tales -  in the original game more than in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">its sequel</a>. The main quests are still separated in different chapters with different minimum level requirements, so it's not possible to pursue a single questline from beginning to end with no interruption, but this setup is way less forced than in the other games, feeling more natural and organic.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251122140521_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Octopath Traveler 0 villains are among the best seen in modern JRPGs</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The introduction of a single playable character is a huge departure from the rest of the series, but Octopath Traveler 0 handles the challenges of having a silent protagonist with its compelling cast of supporting characters, which include over 30 other travellers that interact with each other in special party chat events, and characters with central roles in the "Master of" quests. Despite a relatively limited screen time, these characters quickly become memorable, as their own motivations for going against the Masters of Wealth, Power, and Fame are clear from the get-go, and their backstories are masterfully woven into the individual villain stories to deliver some gripping tales.</p>



<p>The stars of the show in Octopath Traveler 0, however, are the Masters themselves. Designing the main questlines around them, rather than around the heroes, gave the development team all the time needed to paint a complete picture, and do a great job to highlight how much these people are, simply put, monsters in human form. Their actions at the beginning of the game are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg: they are much worse than they appear. Saying precisely why would be entering into heavy spoilers territory, which I won't do, as the beauty of the Octopath Traveler 0 story is learning the heinous acts these villains are capable of. Suffice to say that it is very difficult to remain unmoved when learning of the physical and mental atrocities these individuals are capable of.</p>



<p>As such, the story is often very dark, and with the villains remaining utterly unapologetic until the end, Octopath Traveler 0 is a breath of fresh air for the genre. True, there are times these villains are slightly made to look like victims of fate as much as other JRPG villains, but their actions say it all: they act the way they do due to the complete disregard of everything that isn't their heinous goals. To make a comparison, one of the villains, the Master of Fame Auguste, reminds me of Final Fantasy VI's Kefka Palazzo, a character that has entered the collective memory of JRPG fans mainly because of his completely unhinged destructive tendencies.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251127192212_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Their heinous, cruel acts make it very easy to hate the Octopath Traveler 0 villains</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The twists and changes to the formula established by the first two entries in the series aren't limited to the story setup in Octopath Traveler 0. Though still very similar to what we have seen so far, the new entry in the series twists gameplay in a competent way that makes the whole package more compelling.</p>



<p>In Octopeth Traveler 0, the player travels all over Orsterra, exploring towns and dungeons as quests dictate, interacting with NPCs via Path Actions to learn more about them, acquire items, hire them for combat, or invite them to Wishvale, and fighting enemies in a classic turn-based combat system enriched by the Break and Boost systems. The first allows players to "break" enemies by hitting their weakpoints with the appropriate weapon or element a number of times determined by their shield value, leaving them stunned and defenseless for an entire turn. The second, on the other hand, allows characters to attack more than once with their equipped weapons or power-up skills dictated by the character's Job by spending the BPs that are naturally accumulated every single turn.</p>



<p>While traversal and exploration continue to be one of the weakest element in the series, as the excellent Path Actions interactions are offset by an uninspired field and dungeon design which basically consists of a series of corridors with nothing of relevance besides the occasional treasure chest, the combat system and character progression have seen some small yet significant improvements that have a significant, positive impact on the entire experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251128180948_1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The expanded eight-members party is the biggest gameplay change of Octopath Traveler 0</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With over 30 travelers available, expanding the combat system to include eight characters instead of four was a natural choice. Divided into front and back row, it is possible to switch between pairs at will at the start of a turn, giving access to a bigger selection of attacks and skills each turn, which makes Breaking enemies easier and faster than ever. The bigger party also opens up some effective strategies that improve the pace of combat a lot.</p>



<p>For example, a front row character can spend their BPs to quickly break an enemy, which can then be attacked with everything the back row character has, boosting their abilities using the accumulated BPs and with the full SP granted by the back row automatic restoration mechanics. Some travelers also come with special abilities that can make them switch back to the back row automatically upon use, or that are more effective if used from the back row, opening up a lot of synergies that weren't available in the first two games.</p>



<p>Character progression has also been heavily overhauled to accommodate the much bigger character roster. The series' Job system, which allows players to assign a Job between eight choices - Warrior, Thief, Hunter, Merchant, Apothecary, Cleric, Danger, Scholar - is back in Octopath Traveler 0, but only the Ringbearer can switch between different Jobs after unlocking them. Every other traveler comes with a pre-assigned Job which cannot be changed. Although these Jobs are based on the eight base jobs, they are slightly different variations that either combine skills from two different Jobs, or altogether unique Jobs with unique abilities.</p>



<p>While this, by itself, greatly helps make these characters unique, Octopath Traveler 0 goes the extra mile by offering skill customization options via the Masteries system. By obtaining Mastery items, it is possible to assign up to three Action skills and two Passive skills to any character, which can further differentiate between travelers, even if they belong to the same general Job archetype. This very simple addition, in my opinion, elevates the Octopath Traveler 0 experience significantly, providing a granular upgrade system that is a significant step forward from the basic Job system of the previous entries in the series, allowing players to come up with skill combinations to empower a traveler's set skills and Ultimate Attacks, only partially restrained by the main Job of each traveler.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-Masteries.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Mastery systems provides deep customization options</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides introducing these changes to combat and character progression, Octopath Traveler 0 introduces some brand new mechanics for the series, with the town-building mechanics that allow players to directly influence the restoration of Wishvale. These town-building mechanics are rather straightforward, allowing players to place a certain number of facilities on the available locations and change their appearance, but they are central to the experience, as getting more facilities up and running, upgrading them and inviting more villagers unlocks essential features, including a monster arena that offers rewards for pitting captured monsters against others, and a Museum where it is possible to listen to collected music scores and display special treasure hidden all over Orsterra.</p>



<p>The town building mechanics are expanded organically throughout the Wishvale restoration-focused quests, and never feel like a distraction. On the contrary, they provide a nice variation from all the adventuring, which doesn't change a whole lot during the course of the adventure, due to the aforementioned average level design.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Octopath-Traveler-0-visuals.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Shaping the future of Wishvale is a big part of the Octopath Traveler 0 experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Octopath Traveler 0 represents a solid step forward for the series in terms of story and gameplay, the visuals have taken a step back from the second entry in the series. While the HD-2D aesthetics still look gorgeous, locations don't feel as lively as they did in the previous game, and even assets seem to be of lower quality, closer to the original Octopath Traveler. This isn't a major issue per se, but striving for at least the same level of quality as the franchise's current peak would have been a better choice. However, given that the game is based on a mobile platform, this isn't too surprising.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the same hasn't happened to the other core element of the Octopath Traveler series presentation: music. Series composer Yasunori Nishiki delivered another beautiful soundtrack encompassing pieces that evoke emotions from across the spectrum, moving from high-quality sad, evocative pieces to epic combat themes effortlessly. The voice acting is similarly good, with great performances across the board that make the story more involving, and characters more engaging.</p>



<blockquote>
<h2 id="h-review-in-progress-verdict">Review in Progress Verdict</h2>



<p><strong>Time Played:</strong> 30+ Hours</p>



<p>I have completed the main 'Master of' quests, but I have not yet reached the conclusion of the story. Based on the compelling narrative, the excellent eight-character combat overhaul, and the meaningful addition of the Masteries system, the game currently sits as my personal favorite entry in the series. The ultimate score will depend heavily on the payoff of the final narrative act and whether the combat holds up against the toughest challenges.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pcjsy3/eidos_montreals_current_state_cancelling_several/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> on Reddit's r/gamingleaksandrumors channel, renowned developer Eidos Montréal appears to have laid off more employees for the third time in less than two years.</p>



<p>The first time was in January 2024, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the new Deus Ex project they had been working on got canceled by parent company Embracer Group. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-new-game-pitched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the project was then shopped around to other publishers, but none picked it up because they felt it was too niche.</p>



<p>At the end of March 2025, Eidos Montréal <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost another 75 employees</a> after its work on Playground's Fable reboot ended. Now, the number of people who just lost their jobs is unclear, but their CVs reveal that the Canadian studio had been working on a now-canceled dark fantasy action roleplaying game focused on melee combat and parkour, based on the revival of an established vampire franchise. Needless to say, this appears to be a fairly obvious reference to Legacy of Kain.</p>



<p>The IP originally created by Silicon Knights and later developed by Crystal Dynamics has been dormant for a long time, following the unsuccessful multiplayer action game, Nosgoth, developed by Psyonix and published by Square Enix. Three years ago, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-confirms-taking-control-of-tomb-raider-legacy-of-kain-and-other-ips-from-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained the rights</a> to Legacy of Kain (as well as Tomb Raider and other IPs) from Square Enix. Shortly after that, Phil Rogers, then CEO of both Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-fans-rejoice-eidos-heard-you-loud-and-clear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a major tease to fans</a> that the vampire IP would not be left to waste.</p>



<p>It seems that an attempt was indeed made, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remastered release of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2</a> was likely part of a broader strategy to revive interest in the IP; however, the project was ultimately scrapped. According to the unearthed information, the studio also canceled a 'modern point and click game with turn-based combat', while the status of another project, a 3v3 competitive eSports game taking place in a futuristic setting, is unknown.</p>



<p>Eidos Montréal hasn't released a game of its own since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, which debuted in October 2021. They did, however, co-develop <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grounded 2</a> with Obsidian Games, and apparently, that part of their outsourcing work is still active. </p>



<p>Still, it's a shame they are unable to make a new game in once high-profile franchises like Deus Ex and Legacy of Kain. This inevitably casts a shadow on the storied studio's future.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, the development team behind the free-to-play third-person looter shooter game The First Descendant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNh7vwqYdvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared in an official livestream</a> to outline the December update and the roadmap for the first half of next year.</p>



<p>The December update adds the new Descendant Ultimate Yujin, who's revealed through Yujin's Descendant Story. Ultimate Yujin features a hybrid playstyle with two Ultimate Skill Modules: </p>



<ul>
<li>Combat Protocol, which introduces a new combat-focused playstyle that lets him sustain his HP while dealing damage.</li>



<li>Battlefield Medic, which offers a support-oriented style that grows stronger the more he assists his allies.</li>
</ul>



<p>Players can also explore the new Forbidden Sanctuary dungeon, an experimental facility in Axion that supports multiplayer co-op and features a challenging new boss. The Forbidden Sanctuary offers key rewards for acquiring Ultimate Yujin.</p>



<p>The December update will also introduce The Grim Reaper, a new Abyss Colossus and a mutated form of Death Stalker, which offers a poison-based challenge that requires The First Descendant players to master its mechanics through careful strategy and timing.</p>



<p>Some Descendants, including Ajax, Freyna, Valby, and Viessa, along with select weapons, will also receive balance adjustments to enhance playstyles and skill performance. Moreover, a new Bunny-exclusive External Component, Sprint Accelerator, will be added, and players will be able to trade Ancestors Modules via the Trade Market.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>When it comes to next year's roadmap, the developers have decided to delay the debut of Season 4 from early 2026 to Summer so that they can perform an overhaul of the core experience and systems. The goal is to provide players with a clearer loop: set a goal, farm and experiment with builds, and then tackle structured endgame, especially on “Hard” and above difficulties. In the meantime, Season 3 will continue with Episodes 3 and 4. Even Episode 2 will get something in January with the addition of Breach Tracking, a gold‑oriented farming activity where fields and missions are selected at random and can also drop items like superconductive cooling units.</p>



<p>Season 3 Episode 3 will go live in February 2026, introducing the beta version of the new Onslaught Mode to The First Descendant. This is a four‑player endgame mode where parties of four players face waves of increasingly powerful enemies, strategically placing turrets and buffs using resources gained during battle. The full version is planned to go live with the May update.</p>



<p>Episode 3 also introduces regular Descendant Dia with a main story centered on her, while Episode 4 adds one new Ultimate Descendant. Late during Episode 4, the developers will revamp Hard-mode Void Intercept Battles, turning this activity into a multi‑tier endgame pillar; until the new variant arrives, deep‑Void bosses will rotate monthly so older skins, cosmetics, and previously unobtainable deep‑Void Descendant skins can be farmed again.</p>



<p>Farming at Hard difficulty and above will be restructured around an Operation Command/Directive system, where players first choose the item they want to farm and then clear assigned missions for rewards, with the entire high‑level farming experience being rebuilt.</p>



<p>The Arche Tuning/Mutant Cell system is also being redesigned from fragmented A/B/C item drops into selectable nodes, making it easier to understand what benefits a Descendant and where to get it. Moreover, Stat display will be overhauled so final damage and contributions from modules, reactions, tuning, and externals can be viewed and “simulated” in one menu, reducing reliance on the lab for testing.</p>



<p>Finally, the team revealed that Season 4, currently scheduled to hit live servers in Summer 2026, brings Karel's final battle arc plus a large‑scale Mega Dungeon that surpasses current infiltration operations and Void Vessels in scope and spectacle, alongside a complete weapon system overhaul and the introduction of Transcendent‑tier weapons with a more farming‑centric, less grindy progression model.</p>



<p>The First Descendant <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in July 2024</a> and immediately garnered the attention of many players who were looking for an alternative to existing looter shooters, such as Destiny 2 or The Division 2. NEXON soon boasted that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-celebrates-10m-players-in-first-week-responds-to-allegations-of-copying-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been played by ten million users just in its launch week</a>, although it didn't take long for it to start losing steam, which is why the studio is now trying to overhaul the game's foundation.</p>



<p>On a technical level, the game was pretty advanced. It was the first title to integrate Samsung's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+ Gaming feature</a>, and it was also the first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-is-the-first-ps5-pro-game-to-combine-pssr-with-amd-fsr-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution alongside AMD's FSR Frame Generation on the PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is taking a major step forward as it ages into the back half of the decade <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-gameplay-trailer/">with the release of its expansion, War Sails</a>. The action strategy game is finally adding naval combat in this expansion, and ahead of its release, I got to spend some time hearing about it from developer TaleWorlds Entertainment.</p>



<p>I also got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-qa-interview-with-taleworlds-entertainment/">speak with a couple members of the development team, senior producer Falk Engel and design lead Gökçen Karaağaç</a>, all about this expansion and how it changes Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II, and why TaleWorlds Entertainment is calling this its "<em>biggest expansion ever</em>."</p>



<p>I want to start by saying I'm very new to strategy games. I've previously avoided them because whenever I saw gameplay clips, no matter which specific strategy game it was, it all seemed like it moved too slowly for me. I was also concerned with not being able to really grasp the mechanics, and was overall concerned that I would just not be very good at the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Screenshot_03-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But at the same time, I also knew these concerns were holding me back from an entire genre of video games I knew I might seriously enjoy, particularly when it comes to the strategy games that integrate historical elements into their gameplay. Wanting and willing to finally overcome those concerns is what drove me to Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails, and after spending some time with the game, I can confidently say: I was right to be concerned, I am not very good at these games.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I was also wrong to be concerned, because I'm still having a great time. It helps that this feels like a fresh start, not just for me, but for Bannerlord as well. With the release of War Sails, old saves are getting wiped, and it's a fresh new Caladria to explore on land and on sea.</p>



<p>"<em>Mount and Blade has always been about freedom, it's meant to be a blank slate for you to write your own stories</em>," as TaleWorlds Entertainment's Antonio Santo said in the opening to the studio's presentation ahead of release. You can't get more 'blank slate' than new saves.</p>

<p>It feels understandable, then, that the cost of this expansion, which is $24.99 USD at regular price (currently $22.49 with its introductory 10% off sale), is half the price of the base game (when the base game isn't on sale like it is right now for half-price, which means with the base game at $24.99 and War Sails at $22.49, you get both for the price of Bannerlord not on sale). </p>



<p>I won't be going into detail about the War Sails storyline, purely to avoid spoilers and also because I'm not through all of it. What I can say is that while it does take a bit to get going since you need to scale your naval capabilities and party size to really get a feel for it, I now can't imagine playing Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord without War Sails and without naval combat. In a lot of ways, it really does feel like a whole new arm of the game has been added, and can now be improved upon.</p>



<p>Which is to say, there's incredible potential here, and while War Sails perhaps doesn't deliver on everything you'd want right away with the addition of naval combat, it sets a strong foundation for what could be next.</p>

<p>For one thing, the sailing is wonderfully intricate and fun to try to master. Mastering maneuverability with your own ship, and especially with a whole fleet of ships, creates an incredible spectacle in naval battles. Even if most of my battles did devolve into smash-and-board skirmishes mostly, the wonderful backdrops and learning how to navigate the conditions, paired with a strong soundtrack, strike at the core of what Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord does best.</p>



<p>And the battles where I employed more strategy than just a head-on assault were all the more rewarding because of how challenging it was to work against the wind and stormy conditions. Large-scale battles are where Mount and Blade is at its best, and that's true for its land battles, and now, naval battles.</p>

<p>Of course, combat isn't the only area of Mount and Blade that was changed with the addition of naval combat. In his presentation about War Sails, senior producer Falk Engel said, "<em>Even before the full release of the main title, we started receiving many community requests for a naval</em> <em>expansion. By the time we had finished our work on the core game, it was clear that this type of content would be one of the best additions that we could make. Why? Because the addition of the naval dimension allows us to build upon the wide range of gameplay and content, without taking from what people already know and love</em>."</p>



<p>Which is exactly what TaleWorlds Entertainment did, as the naval expansion not only introduced naval combat, but also changes to the game's economy, to trading, to the balance of importance between cities. Coastal cities like Chaikand are now even more important as a hub for trade. You even get a new port area you can walk around that's tuned to each nation.</p>



<p>Speaking of nations, War Sails also brings the Nords back into the equation, an inclusion that design lead Gökçen Karaağaç told me was introduced partly for nostalgia, partly because they were "<em>easy to justify"</em> introducing. "<em>Oh, they were always up there, and now they've started to pick up their ships and come here</em>," he said in our interview.</p>

<p>The Nords, an entire new area to explore, new campaigns, and an entire new frontier of combat are altogether a sizeable addition to Mount and Blade, though they're by no means perfect. Even with TaleWorlds Entertainment putting out several patches since launch, the odd bug feels bound to happen. Thankfully, it's not been anything too severe, like issues with the game crashing on me consistently; it's been more firmly in the funny, sometimes ruinous, freezes and hitches that, as I said, aren't too bad, but are consistent enough that I expect them.</p>



<p>Of course, they hurt far more when you are, as I did, going against the advice Karaağaç provided, which was "<em>do not sail a ship that you can't afford to lose</em>." The stakes are already high enough with how much it means to lose a ship, or multiple ships, in a battle, and especially because most engagements, once you've boarded an enemy ship, can result in unwinnable situations if you're not careful with how you move across the deck of your ship. Losing your ship and the battle because of an untimely freeze doesn't feel great, no matter how you slice it.</p>

<p>But bugs can be patched, and at least in this case, they don't ruin the entire experience. War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers. Hopefully, now, it won't be another five years before the next major expansion.</p>
