			<p><strong>Callum Vinson</strong>, who you might recognize from the <strong>Chucky</strong> TV series or the recent mini series, <strong>Long Bright River</strong>, has been tapped to play <strong>Atreus</strong> in <strong>Amazon's God of War TV series</strong>, a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-callum-vinson-atreus-1236656985/">Variety</a> has confirmed.</p>



<p>It's the latest major casting announcement for the show, with Vinson joining the likes of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Mandy Patinkin,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Teresa Palmer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Max Parker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-adds-to-god-of-war-tv-cast-with-alastair-duncan-returning-as-mimir-and-two-new-picks-for-brok-and-sindri/">Danny Woodburn</a>,</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>,</a> to name a few. That said, we'll mostly see Vinson alongside <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong>, who is set to lead the show as <strong>Kratos</strong>.</p>



<p>The official character description and logline for the show, included in Variety's report, also give us a clearer picture as to where within the storyline the show will kick off. With Atreus described as only being 10 years old, it's clear that the plan is to start with the plot of the first game, before moving into the events of <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, we know from several of the casting choices that, despite the logline describing the plot of the first game (Kratos and Atreus' journey to spread the ashes of their lost wife/mother), we'll see plenty of characters not included in the first game getting introduced in this first season.</p>



<p>With Mandy Patinkin (Odin), Teresa Palmer (Sif), Max Parker (Heimdall), and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (Thor) all set to play characters we don't meet until Ragnarok, it'll be interesting to see how the show weaves the second game's narrative and characters into the first's.</p>



<p>Now that we know who will be taking on the role of Atreus, the remaining major roles left to be filled are <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, two characters that play major roles between both games that will almost surely play major roles in the show as well. </p>



<p>With the show expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> we'll hopefully find out who will be stepping into both roles very soon. So far, Alastair Duncan and Ryan Hurst are the only two cast members who worked on the games that will also work on the show.</p>



<p>Here's the full cast list so far for Amazon's God of War TV series, led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a></strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>

			<p><strong>Krafton</strong>, the Korean publisher mostly known <a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-ending-ps4-xbox-one-support-only-playable-on-ps5-xbox-series-november-2025/">for being the shepherd of <strong>PUBG</strong></a>, who also gained a fair bit of notoriety last year for <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-claims-unknown-worlds-founders-do-not-want-nor-deserve-their-jobs-back-subnautica/">its ongoing legal battle with the founders of <strong>Subnautica</strong> developer <strong>Unknown Worlds</strong></a>, has reached an "<em>all-time high</em>" in revenue, according to its <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/ir/investor-events/announce/#;">latest financial results</a>. With growth driven by PUBG for a fifth consecutive year, Krafton surpassed <strong>₩3 trillion</strong> <strong>($2.05 billion)</strong> in revenue.</p>



<p>Most of that revenue growth came from its mobile sector, which brought in <strong>₩1.7 trillion</strong> <strong>($1.1 billion)</strong>, followed by PC titles bringing in <strong>₩1.1 trillion ($751 million)</strong>, while consoles contributed <strong></strong><strong>₩</strong>42.8 billion ($29 million). The PUBG franchise, which spans across mobile, PC, and console, saw "<em>double-digit growth</em>," driving the company's overall revenue to a <strong>23% increase year-over-year.</strong></p>



<p>Some of the company's record-breaking revenue came from <strong>inZOI</strong>, the new life sim game from <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/">2025 that broke <strong>one million copies sold</strong> in its first week</a>. The co-op survival game, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827200/MIMESIS/">Mimesis</a></strong>, also got a shout-out as it surpassed <strong>one million copies sold</strong> within its first 50 days as a new early access title from October 2025.</p>



<p>As for its outlook on what the company has coming in 2026, the upcoming extraction shooter, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/extraction-shooter-pubg-black-budget-closed-alpha-next-month/">PUBG: Black Budget</a></strong>, is expected to drive further growth, as is the recently released (as in, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">this just came out three days ago</a>) <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-blindspot-is-a-new-5v5-top-down-tactical-shooter-demo-available-during-february-steam-next-fest/">PUBG: Blindspot</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The company is also planning to lean more on AI after its announcement that it would transition to becoming an <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/">"<em>AI-first</em>" company last year</a>. There are more than a dozen projects in development under Krafton, any of which (save for the PUBG-related ones) could help turn the publisher into more than just the PUBG company.</p>

			<p>In the eight years since Yakuza Kiwami 2 gave us the showdown between the Dragons of Dojima and Kansai, SEGA and the Ryu ga Gotoku Studio, six remasters/remakes and eight new titles in the series have graced all of the major platforms (with even Google Stadia getting to experience Judgment Remastered). Now, the third numbered title (and fourth chronologically) in Kazuma Kiryu's ascension as the most valuable member of the Tojo clan is here, bringing us to Okinawa and some unusual casting choices.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Orphanage-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In the short period of time since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-kiwami-2-double-dragon-hd/">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> wraps up its narrative, Kiryu has taken a step back from the glamorous Tokyo city life and instead resigned himself to take care of the orphanage where he fosters a number of orphaned children alongside his pseudo-adopted daughter, Haruka. Kamurocho is teased in front of the player's face before Kiryu hops into a cab with the intention of making Okinawa his new forever home. Naturally, he's brought back into the fold of yakuza power dynamics when the land his orphanage is built on is crucial for a pair of lucrative government contracts, including a new resort meant to bolster Okinawa's future as a tourist attraction. This doesn't sit right with the Dragon of Dojima, and he finds himself hitting the streets once more to protect his newfound family and give them a place to grow up. From here, Yakuza Kiwami 3 spirals into a narrative spanning both cities with major players of the Tojo clan all claiming a stake in the future of that orphanage and Kiryu is having none of that. </p>



<p>It doesn't matter who stands in Kiryu's way when it comes to protecting his newfound family and the orphanage he founded. Whether it's a sworn brother, Tojo clan lieutenant, or even the local minor family who has staked Okinawa as their claim, his fists will do everything they can to protect the family. Kiryu's Dragon of Dojima style is just as formidable as it was in Yakuza Kiwami 2, letting Kiryu rage out and use everything from salt shakers to motorcycles as weapons in the series' signature brawler combat. New to Yakuza Kiwami 3 is a fighting style based on Okinawan traditions: Ryukyu Style. Here, Kiryu loses the ability to pick up weapons from fallen enemies and instead comes to battle with eight different weapon types, each assigned to different button commands and swapped around freely during the course of combat. Kiryu loses some of the freeform combos from his main fighting style, as each weapon only has one or two used mapped to specific commands and cannot be upgraded independent of one another. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Biker-Gang-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In streamlining Kiryu's weapon-focused fighting style, the entire equipment system of the original game is lost in Yakuza Kiwami 3. This means no weapon durability, no armor, and more importantly, no Golden Gun for completing every substory. What Kiryu does get this time around is a customizable cellphone where accessories like stomach bindings and charismatic photos are instead replaced with lock screens and three charms that can hang off the cellphone. This oversimplification is just one of the core issues surrounding Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties.</p>



<p>Kiryu's roster of substories is also massively cutback for the Kiwami-style remake in lieu of including Bad Boy Dragon (one of the series' best minigames to date). While the original title featured 119 substories, many of these have either been combined into the same multi-part substory or removed altogether. With the Hostess minigame once again MIA for Kiryu's adventure, that's nearly ten substories missing alone. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties only features less than three dozen substories, which, in proper Yakuza fashion, all need to be completed before Amon calls on Kiryu for the signature superboss fight at the end of his adventure. Mine's story also features an Amon fight of his own, but despite completing every bit of content available, I was not able to figure out the requirements for that one.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Kanda-Business-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Yoshitaka Mine, the financier of the Tojo clan, remains the ultimate antagonist of Yakuza 3 but his motivations and rise to power were largely unknown in earlier games. The smartly dressed yakuza in a pinstripe suit was calculating and had a firm hold on the clan's purse strings, but what were his ultimate ambitions? This Tojo lieutenant was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8GBQI4Dn_g">once recognized as the series' tenth most popular character</a>, so it's only natural to want to dig a little deeper into a man who was only featured in a single mainline title (not counting the ghost photograph easter eggs in Yakuza 6).</p>



<p>The second half of the game's title, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, centers solely around Yoshitaka Mine, from his beginnings as a startup founder pushed out by his board of directors, to seeing an attempted assassination of Dojima Daigo. This moment becomes the formation of Mine's motives as he strives to learn just what about this man would make people want to risk their lives to protect him. Getting into the Tojo clan's good graces requires a lot of footwork and getting in with a minor family first, starting with befriending the equally bald and hot-headed Tsuyoshi Kanda. Rather than the usual assortment of substories, Mine's side activities are all about doing damage control for Kanda and doing good deeds in his honor (which usually involve punching faces in any case) to raise his reputation. Completing all of these side missions is by no means mandatory, but it does give the player some motivation to want to stick around just a little bit longer to complete the otherwise immensely short narrative.</p>

<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties clocked in at less than forty hours in total: thirty for Kiryu's campaign and around eight to ten for Mine's Dark Ties story. Much of this is attributed to the removal of minigames and substories alike, streamlining the optional experience while keeping it padded with the usual assortment of bowling, golf, darts, and the like. There are several arcade titles new for a modern release, and both Kiryu and Mine can collect various Game Gear titles if you're itching for that nostalgic fix. Sadly, Surf Ninjas isn't one of those titles you can pick up and play here. </p>



<p>The casting choices at play here in Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties are perhaps the most controversial we've seen in the series to date. Pierre Taki's character in Judgment/Judge Eyes was famously removed and recast as Miou Tanaka due to drug use. Yakuza 4's Tanimura was also recast for the remake due to alleged drug use as well. Here, the most famous of the recasts are of Rikiya, a low-ranking yakuza who wants to become Kiryu's sworn brother in Okinawa, and Goh Hamazaki, a scumbag who is only interested in the resort deal to enrich himself. Hamazaki's recasting alone is perhaps the most controversial, as his face and voice likeness were replaced by Teruyuki Kagawa, a kabuki actor known for playing villain roles in a wide number of TV shows and movies. However, he had his own controversy of sexual harassment that was well-known and documented ahead of the casting announcement. During an interview with Japanese outlet GAME Watch and independently translated by IGN, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-tried-to-think-of-someone-who-makes-you-go-this-guys-a-creep-yakuzalike-a-dragon-director-addresses-controversial-casting">director of Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties admitted</a> that he wanted to cast someone who would make players think 'this guy's a creep'.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Casting choices aside, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is a complete package that carves away so much of the slow and methodical pacing of the original and dresses it up with HD flourishes and streamlined content. What was once one of my favorite entries in the series for being a story about being forced out of retirement for 'one last job' to save his family, Kazuma Kiryu's adventures through Okinawa and Kamurocho alike are given a death by a thousand cuts. Seeing the title's antagonist through a more human lens is an interesting addition for Dark Ties, but I would not recommend this remake to anyone who wants to remember Yakuza 3 as fondly as it was back in 2010.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Will Host a 60min+ State of Play This Week That’ll Feature Indies, Third-Party Games, and the “Latest From PlayStation Studios”]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As predicted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">reliable insider NateTheHate two weeks ago</a>, <strong>Sony</strong> has announced that it will host a <strong>State of Play</strong> event this coming <strong>Thursday, February 12, 2026, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT</strong>. Unlike Nintendo's recent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Partner Showcase Direct</a></strong>, which only featured announcements from third-party games, this showcase promises to feature "<em>eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with <strong>the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios</strong></em>."</p>



<p>That's from the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">PlayStation Blog post</a> announcing the event, which also adds that this showcase will last for over an hour when it's all said and done, with "<em>60+ minutes of news, gameplay updates, and announcements.</em>" </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony and <strong>PlayStation</strong> could pack a lot of news into a showcase that's over an hour long, especially since we now know that it's going to be a general event, and not dedicated to one singular game. In the past, PlayStation has gone back and forth between hosting a general State of Play event and one dedicated to a singular upcoming title in February. With last year's February event being a general show, there was no guarantee this year's would be as well.</p>



<p>What's exciting about this event is the lack of knowledge we have going into it on the first-party PlayStation front. Yes, we know that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">Saros</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">Marathon</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">Marvel's Wolverine</a></strong> are at least three big releases set for 2026 from PlayStation Studios teams, but there are a lot of developers under the PlayStation branch that we need to hear from.</p>



<p>Firstly, we can probably rule out <strong>Naughty Dog</strong>, especially if reports from last year saying that its upcoming title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/"><strong>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</strong>, isn't arriving until <strong>2027</strong></a>, are correct. We may also be able to rule out <strong>Guerrilla Games</strong>, mainly because we just heard from them with <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrilla-cartoonish-coop-game/">the reveal of <strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong>.</a> Though they could show off a little more of the co-op project, since it is due to have a <strong>closed-beta</strong> at the end of the month.</p>



<p>We also probably won't see anything from <strong>Bend Studio</strong>, considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-bend-has-reportedly-laid-off-30-of-its-staff-as-it-kicks-up-a-new-project/">layoffs the team suffered last year after its live service project was cancelled</a>. The same goes for <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">which saw a <strong>God of War</strong> live service game it was working on get cancelled at the start of 2025</a>. It's possible the studio has another project that's ready for the spotlight, but that's in no way guaranteed.</p>



<p>As for who we could hear from, one of the more obvious picks is <strong>Sucker Punch Studios</strong>, which will be looking to follow up the success of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-92-million-ghost-of-yotei-outsold-tsushima/">Ghost of Yotei</a></strong> with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/">Ghost of Yotei Legends</a></strong>, the returning multiplayer mode from Ghost of Tsushima that was announced at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>. It's also likely that <strong>Sony San Diego</strong> takes the spotlight for a few minutes, with <strong>MLB The Show 26</strong> arriving on <strong>March 17, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>There's the chance we see more of the aforementioned Marvel's Wolverine, or, to throw in a wildcard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-will-continue-collaborating-with-insomniac-for-many-years-to-come/">a look at what other Marvel titles <strong>Insomniac Games</strong> might be working on</a>, and once again, Saros and Marathon are likely to make an appearance at the State of Play. But if all we get out of a 60 minutes+ showcase is news for third-party titles, indies, and first-party games we already know about, that won't make for an exciting event.</p>



<p>What would be exciting is finally hearing from <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/"><strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> and seeing what <strong>Cory Barlog</strong> has been working on</a>. Or to learn that, despite project cancellations and layoffs, Bend Studio and/or Bluepoint Games do have something ready to reveal. We can only hope, at this point.</p>



<p>When it comes to third-party games, that opens up a whole new can of worms, with upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-pragmata-demo-delivers-a-smooth-polished-experience-on-pc/">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/evil-has-always-had-a-name-capcoms-new-short-film-sets-the-mood-for-resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-need-to-empty-your-wallet-for-more-ram-007-first-light-updated-system-requirements-lower-ram-and-vram-recomendations/">007: First Light</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/">Forza Horizon 6,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-system-works-shows-more-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-december/">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> </strong>all potentially making an appearance. However, one game that won't be there, according to a new rumour, is the long-awaited <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-announce-release-soon/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>
