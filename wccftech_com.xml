			<p><strong>Peter Moore</strong>, former executive of <strong>SEGA</strong>, <strong>Xbox</strong>, and <strong>Electronic Arts</strong> (among others), shared his opinion on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent appointment of <strong>Asha Sharma</strong> as the new CEO of <strong>Microsoft Gaming</strong></a> and the widespread fears that she'll push heavily on AI (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-new-ceo-committed-to-xbox-starting-with-console-new-hardware-info-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite her reassurances to the contrary</a>).</p>



<p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/for-the-new-xbox-ceo-listening-is-good-peter-moore-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesBeat</a>, Moore acknowledged that most hardcore gamers have an anti-AI sentiment right now, but also added that <strong>she's in a unique position to explain to gamers how it can be a positive change</strong>, as long as it serves the player rather than a spreadsheet. He also mused that <strong>every game developer will use AI in some capacity</strong> anyway.</p>



<p><em>AI is despised by gamers right now, who see it as a false way of creating games, a lazy way, a conveyor belt way. She’s gotta expect that. But we, as an industry, in game development, have been using forms of artificial intelligence forever. It’s just something that ultimately Microsoft needs to figure out exactly your question. Is she there because she’s AI? Or is she there, which is my hope, because she’s proven herself within the Borg at Microsoft and been a very capable executive leader, and this is a great challenge for her, and they wanted to do something different?</em></p>



<p><em>I think her mantra has to be–it’s good for gaming if AI serves the player, not the spreadsheet. She has to be able to explain that. The studios are all going to use artificial intelligence in one form or another. I don’t think the gamer really understands what it all means and how things come together in that way. But I think she has that great opportunity to bridge both worlds and serve growth and deeper immersive experiences. Games that are fundamentally less expensive. Maybe we get games that are better, faster, cheaper, because the cost of game development for triple-A games has become immense. Over the decades I’ve been involved it’s become this massive manual labor thing, hundreds if not thousands of people working on a game. That’s the key. She has that. If I’m her, I have this unique perspective. I just have to turn it into a positive in the eyes of the gamer.</em></p>



<p>Over the past two years, Sharma served as <strong>President of Microsoft's CoreAI</strong> division, leading the company's product portfolio of AI models, apps, agents, responsible AI, and developer tools. Because of that, she might be the perfect person to do what Moore has suggested, although convincing gamers of the benefits of generative AI will probably be quite the effort. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent anti-Larian campaign</a> following the reveal that the studio was using generative AI to write placeholder text, quickly develop concept art, and create internal PowerPoint presentations shows that there's a long way to go in that regard.</p>



<p>The developer of <strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong>, now focused on <strong>Divinity</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would later concede that GenAI tools won't be used to create placeholder concept art</a>. However, it still plans to use the technology to speed up development in other areas. As Moore pointed out, it's likely to be too much of a boon to the industry's most pressing game development issues that most developers won't be able to ignore it.</p>

			<p>As is series tradition, <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></span> features multiple endings where the fate of the main characters is determined by your actions. In this case, it will be how you decide to answer a question releated to Elpis, Umbrella's founder Oswell Spencer's final creation</p>



<p>Here's how to unlock the two endings in the game, and which of them is the one you should be going for.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">WARNING: Massive story spoilers beyond this point. Read at your own risk</strong></em>!</p>

<h2 id="h-destroy-elpis-bad-ending">Destroy Elpis (Bad Ending)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Choices-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">This is the choice that determines which ending you will ge</em><em>t</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Choosing to<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> destroy Elpis</strong> as per Leon's wishes leads to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">bad ending</strong>. Zeno kills Leon before he perishes himself in the ensuing chaos. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grace is saved</strong> and escapes the facility via a rescue chopper, but this is a really unsatisfying ending that leaves some of the main story threads hanging.</p>



<p>In case this is your first choice, you will be given the o<strong>pportunity to return to the moment where Grace has to input the password</strong>, giving you the chance to experience the other ending without having to replay any of the final portions of the campaign.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-elpis-good-ending">Release Elpis (Good Ending)</h2>

<p>By <strong>releasing Elpis</strong>, you will start the chain of events leading to the<strong> good ending</strong> of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Requiem</em>. This is the choice to make to conclude the story properly.</p>



<p>With this choice, you will learn the true nature of Elpis (which was hinted at by the Spencer interview conducted by Alyssa, which Grace watches earlier in ARK), fight the true final boss with Leon, and experience the best possible conclusion of the game's events for both Grace and Leon.</p>

<p>No matter which ending you choose, completing the game once will unlock some <strong>rewards</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Insanity Mode</strong>, the highest difficulty setting, and the ultimate Resident Evil Requiem challenge.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Like the first two entries in the trilogy,<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/"><strong> <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em> will be powered by Unreal Engine 4</strong></a>. While this choice was somewhat expected, especially to get the game out in a reasonable amount of time, some have been disappointed by this confirmation, fearing that the third and final installment of the series will be less advanced than other games powered by <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the trilogy's director <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong>, this will not be true. Quite the contrary, actually: <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong> will be a better game precisely because it uses <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-is-progressing-very-smoothly-we-ask-director-naoki-hamaguchi-why-the-team-chose-not-to-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automaton</a></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> commented on how the confirmation of the game using <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong> became a hot topic of discussion. <em>"But I think most people aren’t necessarily familiar with the actual differences between Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5,"</em> he said.</p>



<p><em>"Around the time we began developing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Unreal Engine 5 was just entering its pre-launch phase. What makes Unreal Engine 5 groundbreaking compared to Unreal Engine 4 are two features: Lumen, its lighting system, and Nanite, which allows you to portray dense graphical detail,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said in regards to the perception that a higher version number means something is more advanced. While these represent the current trends in graphics pipelines, tying the game's development to the <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> roadmap may have risked slowing down the creation of the game.</p>



<p>As such, <em>"we decided early on in development of FFVII Rebirth to stick with Unreal Engine 4. We’re using a graphics pipeline built in-house, which also makes optimization and porting to various hardware more straightforward,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said.</p>



<p>Having such an established pipeline following the development of <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em></strong>, <em>"rather than rebuilding our pipeline from scratch in Unreal Engine 5, it’s far more efficient for us to use Unreal Engine 4,"</em> the series director said. <em>"With all of this in mind, we judged that continuing with Unreal Engine 4 would definitely lead to a better third installment for our customers."</em> </p>



<p>Considering how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong> built upon pretty much every visual and gameplay feature of its predecessor, it's not surprising to learn that the development team is using the same approach for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong>. The experience with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong> is definitely going to help the studio with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong> versions of the game as well, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-30-fps-switch-2/"><strong>target 30 FPS whenever possible.</strong></a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem Immediately Smashes Previous Franchise Record for Player Concurrency on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-smashes-previous-franchise-records-steam/</link>
            <guid>1448149</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> is officially out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2. Following a great reception from critics, the next crucial test to see if <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s latest game in the survival horror franchise is another success is the commercial one. It'll take some time to know for sure, but the very first indicator we have for any game, Steam player concurrency, is already looking good.</p>



<p>In just a few hours, Resident Evil Requiem has already crushed all previous all-time concurrency peaks from Resident Evil games. Right now, it stands at<strong> 267K players</strong> <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3764200/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>, and the figure is likely to rise further throughout this weekend, as people have more time to dive into the adventures of Grace and Leon.</p>



<p>For comparison, the second game in this chart is 2023's <strong>Resident Evil 4 Remake</strong>, which reached <strong>168K</strong> players. 2021's <strong>Resident Evil Village</strong> barely surpassed a hundred thousand (<strong>106K</strong> to be exact) simultaneous players, and 2019's <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> registered <strong>74K players</strong> at its height. That said, one might easily spot a pattern here: the newer games generally did better. The only exception to this was 2020's <strong>Resident Evil 3</strong>, which did worse than its predecessor, stopping at <strong>60K</strong> concurrent players on Steam. However, it was just one year after Resident Evil 2, and the game received significant criticism for its cuts (which <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-3-remake-last-escape-mod-restore-cut-content-add-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a modder is now trying to restore on PC</a></strong>). For the record, 2017's <strong>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</strong> only reached <strong>20K</strong> concurrent players.</p>



<p>The main reason is that <strong>Steam's player base has massively increased since 2017</strong>. As we outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when Valve's platform hit its latest concurrency record (42 million users) last month</a>, <strong>there was a 139% increase</strong> from 2017's <strong>17 million</strong> concurrent users. Even with this caveat, though, the hype for Resident Evil Requiem is very real. Here's an overview of our extensive coverage of the game:</p>
