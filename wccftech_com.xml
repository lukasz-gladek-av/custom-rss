			<p>Blizzard Entertainment is currently allowing those who are interested in playing Diablo 4 the opportunity to play it for free across all platforms on which you can get the game. At the moment, a large amount of ARPG fans are flocking to Path of Exile 2, with the game currently available in Early Access if you purchase it. Path of Exile and Diablo have been compared since the dawn of their very existence together, and Path of Exile 2 is no different. If you find that Path of Exile 2 isn't treating you quite right, or you want a new experience, Diablo 4 is currently available to play for free, thanks to Blizzard.</p>
<p>Once again, Blizzard has brought back the Diablo 4 trial, but with a significant difference. While the trial typically just involves the base campaign, this time, players will get the opportunity to try out the new Spiritborn class from the recent expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Vessel of Hatred</a>. Players won't be able to play the latest expansion, but you'll get to take the new class for a test run and see if it's something you enjoy.</p>
<p>The trial for Diablo 4 is currently available on PC via <a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/#purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle.net</a>, PlayStation, and Xbox. You'll be able to play the game for free until January 3, 2025. This gives you plenty of time to grind out the game, complete the campaign, and see if it's a game you'd be interested in playing in the future. Unfortunately, Diablo 4 isn't available as a free trial on Steam, so you won't be able to play it there if you are a PC user.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you find that you were enjoying your time during the Diablo 4 free trial, the game is on sale for up to 40% off across all platforms, which is the perfect time to get a game that will provide you with lots of value for money, especially with the addition of new content through the new seasons, as well as the ability to play the brand new expansion, Vessel of Hatred.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to purchase the game but want to play it, Diablo 4's base game is available through Game Pass on PC and Xbox, giving you the opportunity to try out the campaign for a significantly lower price than buying the game in its entirety. It does mean you won't have access to the expansion unless you purchase it, but that is a decision you can make later down the line.</p>

			<p>Towers of Aghasba has officially been in Early Access for one month. Dreamlit Games has been talking about the experience thus far and the work they've been doing on the game to improve it during the<a href="https://wccftech.com/towers-of-aghasba-enters-early-access-on-november-19-bringing-a-world-of-cozy-exploration/"> Early Access</a> period. Since its release a month ago, the team has delivered five major patches in the span of four weeks, which added a significant amount of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and some extra features for players to dive into. While looking back at the month they've had, they have also remarked on what they plan on adding to the game to help it continue to grow and provide players with the fun, cozy experience that they've been longing for with this title. If you've yet to pick up Towers of Aghasba, the game is currently 20% off until January 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178070/Towers_of_Aghasba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and 20% off on the PlayStation Store until January 6.</p>

<p>Looking back at some of the updates this game has seen already, it includes an Arachnophobia mode, which changes all spiders in the game to become crabs instead. Although crabs are relatively spider-adjacent. There has also been inventory expansion, allowing players to have an increased number of storage boxes, with more plans for inventory to come in the future.</p>
<p>One of the most favored changes that has been made to Towers of Aghasba is the need to make an Epic Games account. It is no longer necessary to create an Epic Games account to play this title, especially as the game is available on Steam.</p>
<p>There are plenty more changes in the works, with the team at Dreamlit Games currently working on a new major patch that would bring multiplayer co-op questing to the game, which is a feature that has been highly requested by those who are already dedicated players of the game.</p>
<p>Dreamlit Games has also outlined the content that they plan to bring to the game for the full launch. This includes six regions to explore, including forests, ruins, and more, allowing for a ton of discoveries to be made with new flora and fauna in each area. There will be three types of settlement to build, design, and decorate, as well as three types of ecosystems to grow to ensure that your town flourishes. Additionally, Towers of Aghasba will have both single-player and co-op gameplay, allowing you to play with up to three other people to help build and expand your island.</p>

			<p>Black Desert continues to get updates, with new classes and new content added to the game all the time. Most recently, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">Land of the Morning Light: Seoul expansion</a> was released, where players were taken to Ancient Korea, where they could explore architecture, meet new characters, and fight off new enemies in the expansion. Today, it's been announced that the new gunslinging class, Deadeye, is available in early access. Those who want the opportunity to try out Deadeye will be able to go through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/News/Detail?groupContentNo=7956&amp;countryType=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Desert Global Lab</a>, where you'll get to experiment with the class' revolvers, shotgun, and Lil' Devil.</p>
<p>This announcement comes after Pearl Abyss marked a decade of Black Desert at Calpheon Ball, which is a global community event that took place at the Suwon Messe in South Korea. For those unable to attend, the event was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlI-kQ6MCew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live-streamed</a>, and players got to see a ton of announcements unveiled as a celebration of the game's longevity.</p>
<p>The 29th class for Black Desert will be launching worldwide on Black Desert Online and Black Desert Mobile on December 24. Additionally, those who have been wanting to try out this MMORPG but don't want to spend any money on it will be able to get it completely free on Steam right now as a limited-time gift for the holiday season. This comes during the Steam Winter Sale, which runs through January 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="FESTA: A Decade of Adventures 2024 | Black Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlI-kQ6MCew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, as there will be an influx of new players thanks to the game being given away for free, they have boosted progression for those who are just joining. This comes with a 1000% combat EXP boost, which will fast-track progression for those who are on Season Servers. Players will also be able to get Graduation Rewards. These are special materials that players can obtain, which will allow them to craft Ornette's and Odore's Spirit Essence, as well as PEN Boss gear as a reward for completing the latest season.</p>
<p>There are plenty of updates that have been made to Black Desert, including a new mount that has been added to the game, and will be released on January 16, 2025. Black Desert Mobile specifically will also be receiving some major updates, with new content being added to the game in 2025. This includes Awakened Dawnveil Gear, a PvPvE battleground, and Atoraxxion: Vahmalkea, the first zone of Atoraxxion.</p>

			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance will be improved over the open beta, as the game will deliver a better experience than the test version with the same hardware configuration.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-Launch Community Update stream</a>, director Yuya Tokuda confirmed that, while the team cannot provide specifics yet regarding PC performance, PC performance will definitely be improved over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-struggles-1080p-rtx-4070/">open beta test</a>, so players should expect a better experience on the same hardware as in the test version.</p>
<p>During the stream, it was also confirmed that Monster Hunter Wilds will receive a PlayStation 5 Pro day-one patch that will offer some yet-to-be-detailed improvements over the base model. In addition, it was also confirmed that on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the Prioritize Graphics mode will target 2160p output resolution upscaled from 3072x1728 resolution and 30 FPS. The Prioritize Framerate mode, on the other hand, will target 2160p output resolution upscaled from 1080p and 60 FPS. On Xbox Series X, Monster Hunter Wilds will feature a single display mode that will target 1080p resolution and 30 FPS gameplay. In all cases, AMD FSR will be used to upscale the rendering resolution to the output resolution and not checkerboard rendering as in the open beta version.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds Pre-Launch Community Update also goes over plenty of other changes coming to the final version of the game over the test version, such as weapon-specific changes, the return of hitstop, and more. You can check out the entire stream below.</p>
