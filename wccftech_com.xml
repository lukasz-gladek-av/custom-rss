			<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A will arrive on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this year on&nbsp;<strong>October 16, 2025</strong>, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have announced. It'll be available on both the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, with the Switch 2 version featuring "<em>improved graphics and frame rates</em>."</p>
<p>It's right around the time we were expecting the release date to be, because mainline Pokémon releases have all recently launched in that same fall-early winter window to get it in just ahead of the holidays, and because that was the release window Nintendo revealed earlier this year during a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-new-trailer-confirmes-late-2025-release-window-new-extended-look-gameplay-video-released/">Pokémon Presents presentation</a>. You'll be able to pre-order Legends Z-A when the Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company announced the news with a <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1927712162778099735">post on its official X account</a>, sharing a new piece of key art for the game. "<em>Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives October 16, 2026!</em>" the caption for the post reads.</p>
<p>"<em>In addition to the Nintendo Switch title, a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will offer improved graphics and frame rates! The digital and physical versions of Pokémon Legends Z-A can be upgraded to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition via upgrade pack</em>."</p>
<p>There's also going to be another <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1927712715335712964">Pokémon Presents event on July 22, 2025</a>, which will likely showcase more of what's to come in Legends Z-A, and hopefully some news on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-mmo/">what else we can expect to play</a> from the world of Pokémon.</p>
<p><iframe title="An Extended Look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For the<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html"> 150 million+</a> that already own a Nintendo Switch, it's great that one of the biggest series on the platform will still be available on the Switch 1, but it'll be interesting to see what the release of Legends Z-A does for Nintendo Switch 2 sales.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Nintendo Switch 2 is only days away from launching globally, and there's no doubt it'll be a big seller for the rest of the year. But with how poorly the recent major Pokémon releases on the Nintendo Switch have been from a<a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-update-late-february-bug-fixes-functionality/"> technical perspective</a>, it wouldn't be surprising if the launch of Legends Z-A pushes people to upgrade more than any other game we know about in the console's launch year.</p>
<p>Especially if Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives and is borderline unplayable on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's tinyBuild Connect 2025 show, developer Fire &amp; Frost shared a world overview trailer for their upcoming third-person open-world old-school RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-teams-up-with-fire-frost-studios-to-create-of-ash-and-steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Of Ash and Steel</a>. The trailer is narrated by Tristan, a cartographer who also happens to be the game's hero, albeit a bit casually. Moreover, signups for an upcoming playtest are now open on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. While the date hasn't been finalized yet, the developers said players will be able to experience a few of the quests and the story's beginning.</p>
<p>According to Fire &amp; Frost, Grayshaft, where Of Ash and Steel is set, is one of the seven islands that make up the Kingdom of the Seven. While filled with beautiful environments, such as peaceful meadows stretching alongside endless crop fields, thick, ancient forests soon take over the horizon, shrouding crumbling ruins and long-forgotten relics.</p>
<p>The locals describe the island as a living entity, temperamental and unstable. The weather can change in an instant, a gentle breeze turning into a violent storm in moments. While some parts of the island bloom with color and life, others remain frozen all year round. Not even the ancient volcano at the heart of the island can warm the lands it overlooks.</p>
<p>Danger lurks around every corner. Whether players wander well-trodden paths or venture down hidden trails, chances are they shall encounter bloodthirsty beasts, merciless scavengers, and monstrous creatures. Still, those who persevere will be rewarded: hidden caves, buried treasures, and long-lost secrets await the brave.</p>
<p>Wildlife, bandits, and monsters are not the only dangers on the island: Grayshaft is also home to factions, some of which are vying for control and power. The Order of the Seven is renowned for its code and discipline, while the Free Hunters answer only to their own sense of justice. Many more groups operate in the shadows or on the fringes of society, so players won't know who to trust at first glance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - World Overview Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWe9CU1JFAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fire &amp; Frost previously revealed that Of Ash and Steel features over 300 quests and has over 30K lines of dialogue, not to mention 180+ weapons, 270+ armor/cloth/jewelry pieces, 30+ monsters, 200+ crafting recipes, 5 hours of completely original in-game soundtrack, and 80+ random world events.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel is tentatively slated to launch for PC later this year. There's been no mention of other platforms yet.</p>

			<p>Those lucky enough to get a Nintendo Switch 2 before its official launch will only have a rather expensive paperweight on their hands until the system's day one update goes live, according to new online reports.</p>
<p>As reported by Wario64 on X following a short YouTube video featuring a quick unboxing of the system, which has since been removed but has been saved for posterity by <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1927448039330894258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Crave</a>, a user who got an early unit of the console confirmed that the console cannot play any game, neither Switch 1 nor Switch 2 games, without downloading the day 1 update which cannot be done as of now, as the update function will not be available before June 5th, the day the system officially launches worldwide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another person shared with me that they have a Nintendo Switch 2 as well. I have no permission to post pics but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts "Please connect to the internet and update your system."</p>
<p>Needs update to boot a game <a href="https://t.co/18TU7Skk1D">pic.twitter.com/18TU7Skk1D</a></p>
<p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1927441748923457581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Though disappointing, the Nintendo Switch 2 not being able to play any game before its official release date next week will have no impact on the popularity of a system that is rightly expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">massive success</a>. Launching with the system on June 5th are plenty of games that will definitely contribute to the system's popularity, such as Mario Kart World, which will likely feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-reverse-track-mode/">reverse track mode</a> as suggested by some recent footage, and a slew of third-party developers ports such as Cyberpunk 2077, which is already showing well <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">before release</a> what the system is capable of, Hogwarts Legacy and a few others. The immediate future is also looking bright, with games like Donkey Kong Bananza and Metroid Prime 4: Echoes and others launching in 2026 and beyond, which may be able to deliver better visuals and performance by using more of the system resources than the launch window games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-1-cpu-core-ram/">according to rumors</a>.</p>
