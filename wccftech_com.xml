			<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new posts</a> from Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella, he predicts that Nintendo's next hardware device (which is supposed to be the Nintendo Switch 2) will sell approximately 4.3 million units in the US in 2025, assuming that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released in the first half of the year. Many were expecting more news to be released last year, but it felt that the audience was still kept in suspense, as we are no closer to knowing the release date of the upcoming console.&nbsp; Despite that, there are tons of leaks coming out about the upcoming console constantly, with some being believable and others being incredibly outlandish.</p>
<p>At the moment, the console doesn't have a set release date, but according to an Italian website, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-launch-on-march-28-says-italian-website/">the Nintendo Switch 2 could launch on March 28</a>. However, all of these rumors come after people <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/">speculated that it would be announced before the New Year</a>, except that information never came. Whether it will be released in the first half of the year remains to be seen. However, if it does, it means that revenue will be on the rise for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Despite that, Nintendo isn't expected to rank 1st in overall hardware units sold, according to Mat Piscatella. Instead, he believes that the PlayStation 5 will continue to rank 1st in overall hardware units sold in the US during the year. This statistic could very well be possible, especially with the release of the PS5 Pro, with new games getting PS5 Pro enhancements regularly.</p>
<p>If the Switch 2 is released in the first half of the year, Piscatella says that he expects to see hardware constraints for several months after due to a significant early demand surge. This is something that has been seen for all recent console releases, with the PlayStation 5 in particular continuing to suffer from this. With there being hardware constraints have led to prices being raised and the console constantly being out of stock, especially with the consoles ending up in the hands of scalpers, where tons of consoles then resurface on online markets for an extortionate price.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Piscatella gave a sneak peek into the percentage growth in video game spending for the year, saying that he expects low to mid-single-digit percentage growth over the year, helped by Nintendo Next and Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite GTA VI reportedly being released this year, there are many who are now beginning to lose faith in that and feel that it will be delayed until later in the year or even next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> promises to be a massive game-changer, introducing significant image quality and performance improvements, as highlighted by an early test conducted at CES 2025 with CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry had the chance to go hands-on with NVIDIA DLSS 4 and the recently announced RTX 5080 GPU, highlighting in a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-dlss-4-on-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-5080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> how, even in its early state running on an engineering sample without the final driver, the new version of the tech is a different AI-upscaler compared to the current version, introducing significant image quality and performance improvements. The new model using a vision transformer brings greater image stability, reduced ghosting, higher detail, and enhanced anti-aliasing, improvements that address a good portion of the image quality issues seen with the previous convolutional neural network used by DLSS 3.</p>
<p>Among the improvements NVIDIA DLSS 4 will bring is the RTX 50 series-exclusive Multi Frame Generation, which generates up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suit of DLSS technology to provide a frame rate boost of up to 8x over traditional rendering. In one of the game's most demanding areas, the black market in the Petrochem stadium, using NVIDIA DLSS 4 and current Frame Generation on an RTX 5080, Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 4K output resolution with path tracing with a 535% frame-rate boost compared to native 4K resolution. The boost gets bigger at 725% with two generated frames and a whopping 935% with three generated frames. In every scenario, this means that the framerate went well past the 120 FPS mark, which is extremely impressive, considering we are talking about the game running with demanding path tracing.</p>
<p>Frame pacing is also improved in the x4-enabled multi-frame generation compared to the regular x2 of the single-frame generation, as NVIDIA had promised in the announcement. The only downside is the additional latency. Digital Foundry measured latency at 55.50 ms average when using DLSS 4 x3 and 57.30 ms when using DLSS 4 x4, compared to 50.97 ms with single-frame generation (x2). There's an additional 6.4 milliseconds of latency when using x4 instead of x2, then, but you get a 71% frame rate boost, which is more than a fair trade.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is among the games that will get native in-game support later this month, together with Alan Wake 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and others. A few more titles, like Black Myth: Wukong and Marvel Rivals, will receive in-game support at a later time, while Alan Wake 2 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting two new technologies</a> (RTX Hair and RTX Mega Geometry, respectively) that are part of the newly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Kit</a>.</p>

			<p>The new year has just begun, and unfortunately, there has already been some bad news. Splash Damage has <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a> that they have made the decision to end development on Transformers: Reactivate. Along with this means that there will also be a number of staff being made redundant, as they are reshuffling their studio and refocusing on other projects within the studio. Transformers: Reactivate was <a href="https://wccftech.com/transformers-mmo-by-certain-affinity-moved-to-splash-damage-report/">first announced in December 2022</a>, with minimal news coming out about it after the initial announcement.</p>
<p>The title was set to be a 1-4 player online action game that would be on PC and consoles, where you would have to reassemble the Autobots that were left in pieces in the debris. It was created in collaboration with Hasbro, Inc. The cinematic trailer for this title seemed promising, and had a lot of Transformers fans excited. Splash Damage is the studio behind Dirty Bomb, Gears Tactics, and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.</p>
<p>The full announcement from Splash Damage reads as the following:</p>
<p><i>Today, we have some very difficult news to share, the decision has been made to end the development of Transformers: Reactivate.</i></p>
<p><em>This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy.</em></p>
<p><em>This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people. We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on Transformers for their dedication and passion.</em></p>
<p><em>Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.</em></p>
<p><em>While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your compassion and understanding.</em></p>
<p>While they will no longer be working on this title, they announced in March 2023 that they are creating a new project called "Project Astrid" alongside streamers Shroud and Sacriel. The game is set to be an open-world survival game. Hopefully, those who were working on Transformers: Reactivate will be given the option to stay at the company, working on Project Astrid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/smite-2-gets-open-beta-launch-adding-three-new-modes-five-new-gods/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Smite 2 has been in Alpha for a little while now, with new Gods being added pretty consistently to the game. At the moment, there are only two modes available, with players having the choice between playing Arena or Conquest. However, the MOBA is now set to enter Open Beta, allowing any who are interested to start playing it as of January 14. So, for those interested, you won't have long to wait.&nbsp; The game has been progressing at a steady rate, with most of the team at Hi-Rez swapping working on Smite to Smite 2. For those who haven't had access to Smite 2, there was a confirmed skeleton crew to be working on Smite just for small updates.</p>
<p>However, as they rearranged the team working on Smite, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/">led to layoffs</a> at the company that was not disclosed in the statement that Stewart Chisam wrote, but that the changes were "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was originally released in 2014, with its successor announced 12 months ago. This came after Hi-Rez celebrated 10 years of Smite, and now they are working on a new and improved that comes with multiple new Gods and plans to keep the game in action late into the 2030s.</p>
<p>At the moment, those who have wanted to play Smite 2 will have had to get a key for the Alpha via Smite 2 streams or purchase <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Founder's Pack on Steam</a>, which would give them extra bonuses in addition to access to the game as it develops.</p>
<p>With the release of the Free to Play Open Beta, it means that all of the pre-existing players and those who are just joining will get access to a ton of new content that will become available during this period specifically.</p>
<p>This includes five new Gods that will be added to the game, including Aladdin. Along with the variety of Gods in the game, there will also be three new game modes to jump into. These are Joust, Duel, and Assault, offering plenty of options for players who don't get on with the Conquest and Arena game modes that were already in the game. You can check out the Aladdin gameplay in the video below.</p>

<p>Will you be picking up Smite 2 in the Open Beta? If so, what Gods do you plan on playing?</p>
