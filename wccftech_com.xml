			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> by NVIDIA as one of the games that would be updated with the new features introduced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5090-suprim-soc-32-gb-gpu-review-enter-the-realm-of-ai-charged-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards</a>, which are due to launch in two days. That made perfect sense, given the current support of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Reflex, and path tracing.</p>
<p>However, we had no timeframe for the addition of those features until the game's developer, MachineGames, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/503940938959160381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> one a few hours ago. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be updated with those features (alongside some bug fixes) with a patch due in February.</p>
<p><em>We're happy to confirm that Update 3 will release in February and will include support for NVIDIA's latest generation Blackwell GPUs; new graphical features and options; and bug fixes based on feedback you've provided. (Notably, issues that have prevented some players from 100%-ing the game and from climbing vines or squeezing through walls in Sukhothai.)</em></p>
<p>While MachineGames did not mention specific features, they should be NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the brand new RTX Hair. The former will, of course, provide a further performance boost to an already fairly well-optimized game, and the latter is part of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Kit</a>.</p>
<p>With the new graphics cards, NVIDIA has introduced Linear-Swept Spheres (LSS), a GPU-accelerated primitive that reduces the amount of geometry required to render strands of hair. LSS uses spheres instead of triangles to match hair shapes more accurately. According to NVIDIA, LSS enables ray-traced hair to be rendered with better performance and a smaller memory footprint.</p>
<p>RTX Hair is one half of what NVIDIA is calling the 'RTX Character Rendering SDK,' which will be available later this month. While RTX Hair is set to debut in February with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, there's no news yet on any game implementing the other half, RTX Skin. However, we do know RTX Skin will be available as part of RTX Remix.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has at least one expansion planned, the story DLC titled The Order of Giants. Moreover, it will launch on PlayStation 5 this Spring.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, GSC Game World <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/533214336538117150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first new patch of 2025 for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, updating the game to version 1.1.4. This patch aims to fix existing issues, such as the performance degradation that occurred when shooting and/or aiming while on a save with long playtime.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog shared by the developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crashes and freeze on shaders compilation</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak occurred at Rostok location</li>
<li>Fixed performance degradation when shooting/aiming on saves with long playtime</li>
<li>Implemented fixes that should solve the problem causing saves to be lost on Xbox</li>
<li>Fixed a random crash related to UI animations.</li>
</ul>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launched in late November after a long and problematic development process that was interrupted by war, hacks, and an office fire, among other things. While still rough around the edges, the game managed to be a proper follow-up to the first game, as I outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the review</a>:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>
<p>Since then, the team has been hard at work at ironing out some of those issues, like with today's patch. There's undoubtedly more work to do, but GSC Game World is willing to go for it. Their post-launch roadmap also <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes</a> the release of official modding tools, the addition of multiplayer, the support for hardware ray tracing, not to mention at least two expansions promised to owners of the Ultimate Edition/Season Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phoenix-labs-fae-farm-developer-lays-off-majority-of-the-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been announced that Phoenix Labs, a small indie developer that created Fae Farm and Dauntless have now laid off the majority of the studio in an announcement made on LinkedIn. It's uncertain how many staff were still working at Phoenix Labs during this time, as they also had layoffs in May 2024, where over 100 staff were laid off, and all projects were canceled. This was so they could focus solely on Dauntless and Fae Farm. Below is the message left by the company on LinkedIn today.</p>
<p><em>"Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs. We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We will share more details in the coming weeks about what this means for Dauntless and Fae Farm. For now, our focus is on supporting those affected through this transition.</em></p>
<p><em>To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals - they are some of the best in the business."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>At the moment, the full number of layoffs hasn't been announced, and as the statement says, details regarding Dauntless and Fae Farm will be released in the coming weeks. However, the mention of them in the announcement gives a sense of foreboding and that the games are likely to lose support or Dauntless will be taken offline due to lack of resources or revenue. Of course, this is all speculation, and it could be that those games will continue to be worked on, with updates released in the future.</p>
<p>These layoffs come just two years after being acquired by the blockchain firm Forte Labs. The dealings that came with being acquired by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/garena-acquired-phoenix-labs-dauntless-now-eyeing-mobile-release/">blockchain firm</a> led to a lot of questions and tense environments within the company, such as the fact that they were told to keep the purchase a secret, with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former employees having to sign NDAs</a>.</p>
<p>After this happened, Dauntless launched on Steam but was immediately criticized by those who played it due to the in-app monetization and erasing any previous progress made by players thanks to the Awakening update. As a result of this update, Dauntless currently sits at "Overwhelmingly Negative" on Steam.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dauntless-hands-on-at-e3-2017/">Dauntless was fairly successful</a> when it was first released in 2019, with the game initially launching on the Epic Game Store, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. It was a title funded and published by Epic Games. For the time, cross-platform functionality was a selling point of Dauntless. However, that is increasingly more common nowadays and is no longer a special feature for players to look out for.</p>
<p>Already, this month has seen a significant amount of layoffs, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">Ubisoft also laying off staff today</a> and closing one of their studios. It doesn't look like it'll be slowing down any time soon.</p>
