			<p>Dying Light: The Beast is due out in a little less than a month from the time of this writing, as it'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on September 19, 2025. As part of the road to launch, developer Techland has debuted a new trailer, and more interestingly, shown off some behind-the-scenes concept art, and gone into detail about the team's design intentions with multiple elements of the game in a <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-they-tried-to-break-him">new developer blog</a>.</p>



<p>Techland delves into Kyle Crane's return, and the artistic direction behind what he looks like now after a decade of imprisonment, and how to tell the story of his time in captivity without the player being able to constantly look at his face in what Techland refers to as an FPP game (first-person parkour). Kyle's arms, then, were given great focus.</p>

<p>"<em>In an FPP game, it’s difficult to convey the appearance of a character, since one of the few elements visible are the hero’s hands. That’s why we put a lot of effort into the details here. A special shoutout to Charidimos Bitsakakis, who, accompanied by other artists, spent countless hours perfecting them. We recreated Kyle’s hands from the first game, but added scars and other marks reflecting the torture he endured in the Baron’s lab. The experiments also gave rise to the Beast Mode, which we wanted to be visible in FPP as well - we looked for a visual language to represent his transformation and decided on black veins, dark and menacing, perfectly reflecting Kyle’s nature and what he sees when he becomes the Beast.</em>"</p>

<p>The blog also digs into the ways Techland looked to evolve gameplay in Dying Light: The Beast through tweaking and adjusting Kyle's animations, that they should both "<em>be inspired by DL1 Kyle - reflecting his muscle memory, personality, and fighting style</em>," and have "<em>a clear contrast between Kyle in the beast mode - brutal, uncontrolled, overconfident - and Kyle outside of it - pragmatic, precise, and confident</em>."</p>



<p>It's alltogether great dive into Kyle Crane and Dying Light: The Beast for fans who are eagerly anticipating the game's release next month.</p>



<p>When Wccftech checked out Dying Light: The Beast in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/">a preview earlier this year</a>, Kai Tatsumoto found that Crane had indeed been turned into a beast, saying it was the one "<em>certain</em>" thing about the game, even after only checking out an early portion.</p>

			<p>Today, Sucker Punch Productions announced <a href="https://x.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1961111668345241612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> that their upcoming game Ghost of Yōtei has officially gone gold. This means the game is fully completed and has been sent to be mastered for physical copies, although of course, these days a studio's work is never done. Sucker Punch will still likely continue up to the last minute for the day-one patch, and even beyond that. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">know</a> that Ghost of Yōtei, like its predecessor, will receive a 'Legends' multiplayer mode in 2026, free for all owners of the game.</p>



<p>A spiritual successor to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima, the new game is however set in a different place, at a different time, and with a different protagonist. In this one, players will step into the role of Atsu, who at the beginning of the game is nearly killed alongside her family by the so-called Yōtei Six, led by the renegade samurai Lord Saitō and consisting of the Snake, the Oni, the Kitsune, the Spider, and the Dragon. Sixteen years later, Atsu roams the surroundings of the titular Mount Yōtei to exact bloody vengeance on the aforementioned group.</p>



<p>New features compared to Ghost of Tsushima include dynamic weather effects, such as snow, rain, and auroras, inspired by the real-life environment surrounding Mount Yōtei. Additionally, Sucker Punch has <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's flexible, nonlinear quest structure allows players to choose the order in which they confront the Yōtei Six, fostering emergent narrative paths and player-driven momentum. Similar to the first game, players can take on side missions, such as hunting outlaws for bounty rewards. Several side activities also return, including bathing in an onsen and cutting bamboo, as well as new activities such as sumi-e painting and setting up a campsite where Atsu can cook and play her shamisen.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game length</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-a-similar-sized-map-to-tsushima-but-it-has-been-designed-to-feel-larger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">map size</a> are said to be similar to the previous entry, though the developers also said that the game world will feel larger, owing to the real environments. Ghost of Yōtei will be released on October 2 for PlayStation 5, with a PC version practically assured to follow in about a year or so, given Sony's recent policy.</p>

			<p>Another massive batch of developers under Microsoft and more specifically under Blizzard have voted in favor of unionization under the Communications Workers of America (CWA), as 450 developers working on Diablo voted for unionization.</p>



<p>Per a press release from the CWA, those who voted for unionizing will join members of the CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, the CWA Local 1118 in Albany, and the CWA Local 6215 in Austin. Microsoft, in keeping with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">promise made to help push its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King through</a>, has recognized the union. </p>



<p>That's not to say that Microsoft has been entirely welcoming to the hundreds of game developers under it that have unionized in recent years. It took the ZeniMax QA union, the first major union to form under Microsoft thanks to the deal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">two years to reach a deal</a>, and they eventually had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/">strike</a> to help get its deal through. </p>



<p>There are still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">other unions</a> under Microsoft working for a deal, but still, it's all a step towards creating a better situation for the developers.</p>



<p>"<em>With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us</em>," said Kelly Yeo, producer on Diablo. "<em>I am overjoyed that we have formed a union—this is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear. We are ready to begin fighting for real change alongside our Diablo colleagues.</em>"</p>



<p>Nav Bhatti, senior software engineer on Diablo added, "<em>My entire career as a developer has seen my peers and I paying the ‘passion tax’ for working in an industry that we love</em>. <em>At some point you have to choose between fight or flight, and forming a union is us doing just that — standing our ground in the industry.</em>"</p>



<p>This is the latest wall-to-wall unionization effort at Blizzard since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">Overwatch 2 team </a>formed its union, and if the reports we've heard, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-king-layoffs-chaos-microsoft-mandatory-daily-ai-use/">continue to hear</a>, about working conditions under Microsoft are even half true, it likely won't be the last as workers continue to fight for a better quality of life. </p>
