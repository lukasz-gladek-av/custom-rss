			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday, NVIDIA brings the highly anticipated news regarding the launch date of the RTX Blackwell update: the cloud servers will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded to GeForce RTX 5080-class hardware</a> (and improved CPU as well) on Wednesday, September 10. </p>



<p>The rollout will be gradual as usual, so do not be alarmed if your nearest server isn't up to snuff yet. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-significant-level-up-of-the-geforce-now-experience-at-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, there's a lot more than the GPU and CPU upgrade, though. Features like Cinematic Quality Streaming, Rivermax hardware packet pacing, L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput), improved racing wheel devices support, and Steam's Install-to-Play are leveling up the experience in all regards: visuals, latency, hardware compatibility, and expanded games support.</p>



<p>On that note, GeForce NOW users can look forward to a very busy September featuring practically all the most anticipated PC game releases, starting this week with METAL EDEN, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Cataclismo, Hell is Us, and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<p>Hell is Us and Cronos: The New Dawn support up to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, so from next week, Ultimate subscribers who live near an RTX Blackwell-upgraded server will get to enable that. You can find our Hell is Us review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and our Cronos: The New Dawn review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, if you're interested in our take on these titles.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared the full list of GeForce NOW games scheduled to be added to the cloud platform throughout the rest of September:</p>



<ul>
<li>Firefighting Simulator: Ignite (New release on Steam, Sept. 9)</li>



<li>Borderlands 4 (New release on Steam and Epic Games Store, Sept. 11)</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MindsEye's terrible launch may have impacted more than developer Build a Rocket Boy's future, judging from some recent statements from Io Interactive's CEO Hakan Abrak.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">IGN</a>, the company's CEO talked about collaborating with Build a Rocket Boy, saying that the publisher appreciated some of the great ideas the developer had for their game and the great world in the background, and wanted to help them distribute the game. MindsEye's launch, however, was terrible and far from what IO Interactive hoped for its IOI Partners publishing push. As such, the company will continue to self-publish its own titles, like the upcoming 007 First Light, but may not publish other studios' games in the future.</p>



<p>MindsEye is among the worst-reviewed games of the year, and it's easy to understand why, as it is a very underwhelming experience that would require a ton of work to reach an acceptable level of quality. Unfortunately, it seems like these improvements will take a long time to get implemented, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">updates have become less frequent</a> since July, with developers getting<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> layed off</a> from the studio following the game's release. Likewise, a cross-over with the Hitman series was also delayed, and with today's statements from the IOI CEO, it wouldn't be surprising for it to never see the light of day.</p>



<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Half-Life 3 HLX Progresses With Optimization and Gameplay Updates]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The development of Valve's HLX project, speculated to be Half-Life 3, is proceeding with optimization, changes to gameplay mechanics, and new features.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, known Valve dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McVicker</a> provided an overview of every update made for the HLX project found in the most recent Counter-Strike 2 update. While no major change has been introduced, quite a bit of work has been done on the project, with the expansion of the vehicle system, a new particle system specifically made for HLX that will handle liquids, a friction system, and a new system that will determine what happens when an enemy part is destroyed.</p>



<p>The most notable changes introduced in the project rumored to be Half-Life 3 in what has been Valve's busiest month in decades, looking at Perforce activity, the version control software used by the company that creates builds based on the most recent version of files, are related to optimization. For example, a new system that logs how much time is needed to load any game element has been introduced, suggesting work on load times optimization. Also, some cleanup and further optimization have been made in the enemy AI files, specifically for the system determining how an enemy reacts to events. This is particularly notable, as doing optimization work on these systems suggests the game is content locked. From this alone, it is impossible to tell when the project speculated to be Half-Life 3 will be revealed, but the fact that such work is being done suggests that the wait is definitely becoming shorter.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it was rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">Half-Life 3 HLX could finally be revealed this Summer,</a> the project remains a complete mystery. Although there's still this year's The Game Awards show, it's unlikely Valve will need any major gaming event to unveil what may be one of the most anticipated games of all time, so an announcement could really be coming at any time, to the joy of all those who have continued to be fans of the series despite its absence from the spotlight.</p>
