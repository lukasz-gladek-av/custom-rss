			<p>Following the good news that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> one million units sold (not counting all Game Pass users who are playing the game), the Ukrainian development team has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined</a> the main fixes that will be released with the first post-launch update. The game is rather buggy and unbalanced, so, understandably, they will focus on these areas first.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Crash Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Issues and memory allocation failures, which previously caused the game to exit unexpectedly, particularly around rendering, skeletal meshes, and quest-related cutscenes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Main Quest Progression Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Several bugs blocking the main quest progression, NPCs getting stuck in objects, incorrect quest markers, and issues with quest cutscenes.</em><br>
<em>Revision of the main quests (like Visions of Truth or A Minor Incident) to ensure smooth transitions, avoiding rare cases of players not being able to proceed further.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Gameplay &amp; Balance Adjustments, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Fixing the price of the weapons with upgrades installed compared to their value without attachments.</em><br>
<em>NPCs behavior, including the way they act when lacking a shelter during the Emissions.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cutscenes &amp; Visual Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Rarely missing facial animations, misplaced NPCs, and visual inconsistencies like detached heads and clothes clipping.</em><br>
<em>Quality and stability improvements of the visual effects.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Softlock Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Issue where players were unable to close the trade screen after putting ammo in a wrong slot while playing on a gamepad.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>User Interface Improvements, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Quest notifications now showed correctly during dialogues.</em><br>
<em>Corrected texts and missing interaction prompts.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Noted to be addressed in future updates:</strong></em><br>
<em>Analogue sticks dead zones bugfixes.</em><br>
<em>A-Life system bugfixes.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my take</a> on STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl:</p>
<p><em>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</em></p>
