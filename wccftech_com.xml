			<p>Xbox Game Pass is reportedly profitable even when factoring in loss sales of first-party titles available on the service, according to a known business journalist.</p>



<p>Providing a clarification on yesterday's statement revealing that Xbox Game Pass is profitable, taking fees paid to third parties, marketing, and service costs into account, but not lost sales of first-party titles, The Game Business founder Chris Dring stated today on <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring">X</a> that the subscription service is profitable even when factoring these lost sales. 18 months ago, the journalist checked with Xbox what's included in the Game Pass P&amp;L, and was told that first-party games have their own P&amp;L separate to Game Pass as they make money via other means, which may have meant that Xbox Game Pass was profitable but potentially also put pressure on the margins for first-party games, possibly with some studios not making much profit, if any at all. All this, however, was before Xbox games started being released on other consoles, as studios can now make more margins on premium sales. Regardless of all the information above, sources have reached out to Chris Dring to confirm that, even if lost sales of first-party titles and related microtranscations are taken into account, Xbox Game Pass is still profitable.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Ok, I need to correct/clarify something.

</div></figure>



<p>Xbox Game Pass's profitability and the impact it has been having on the industry as a whole have been a point of discussion since the service's launch a few years back. No matter its profitability, the impact in terms of loss sales seems to be big, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">estimated</a> earlier this year that games available via the subscription service can lose has much as 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, as was highlighted by how games like Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Starfield failed to make a real splash on sales charts. On the other hand, a multiplatform game available on Xbox Game Pass can have a beneficial impact, as it can be accompanied by increased sales on another format.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-july-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-announced-for-july-2025/">announcing</a> that Ghost of Yotei would be getting a dedicated State of Play event sometime this month, PlayStation has announced when that State of Play will happen, and it'll take place just two days from now at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>In a new<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/watch-the-ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive-on-july-10/"> PlayStation Blog post</a>, PlayStation has confirmed that the Ghost of Yotei State of Play will take place this Thursday, July 10, 2025, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST. The presentation will be a 20-minute-long deep-dive on Ghost of Yotei's gameplay, and will feature the creative directors from Sucker Punch, Nate Fox and Jason Connell, discussing the gameplay, and showing off "<em>new weapons, new ways to personalize your journey at the edge of Japan, new special modes, and much more</em>," the blog post reads.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We now have less than 100 days to go from now until Ghost of Yotei's previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">October 2, 2025</a>, release date. The follow-up to Sucker Punch's 2019 samurai epic, Ghost of Tsushima currently carries the full weight of PlayStation's first-party fall lineup, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon was delayed</a> from its original September release date and a new release date for it was not announced. </p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the rest of the major games that'll be available to PlayStation players are coming from third-party developers, though of course, there's still time for PlayStation to announce another first-party title coming before the end of the year. Astro Bot, last year's GOTY at The Game Awards wasn't announced until the midway point of the year. That said, we're already past that, so it'll be interesting to see if Sony does have anything else up its sleeve, or if Ghost of Yotei gets to hog the entire fall/winter spotlight for PlayStation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tokyo Game Show 2025 is a little more than two months away at the time of this writing, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/tokyo-game-show-2025-exhibitors-list-and-main-visual-announced">Gematsu</a>, the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association has<a href="https://tgs.cesa.or.jp/en/news/detail/40012"> announced</a> the first batch of exhibitors who will be in attendance. The CESA also debuted this year's new key art for the event, which was illustrated by Zashiki Warashi.</p>



<p>So far, this year's show is significantly bigger than last year's, with this year featuring 4,083 booths compared to last years 3,252. There are 772 exhibitors confirmed for this year, the majority of them being local to Japan, while 299 exhibitors are coming from overseas to showcase their games and products at Tokyo Game Show 2025.</p>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square Enix, Sega, Konami, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-cancels-monster-hunter-wilds-lecture-amid-player-harassment/">Capcom</a> are among the exhibitors that are confirmed to be in attendance at the show, which will run from September 25-28 and be hosted at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other notable exhibitors include Annapurna Interactive, Arc System Works, EA, Koei Tecmo, Pearl Abyss, Riot Games, Ubisoft, and Bandai Namco.</p>



<p>Tokyo Game Show is not often an event where we see major announcements, but its placement in the year falling after Gamescom but ahead of the holiday season means we do usually get a deeper look at some of the bigger titles set to arrive in the fall/winter. It'll be interesting to see what this year's show holds.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-coming-to-runescape-dragonwilds-mortal-online-2-and-brickadia.1238130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Three PC games are integrating NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation shortly. Chronologically, the first one will be Jagex's RuneScape: Dragonwilds, the cooperative open world survival crafting game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in early access nearly three months ago</a>. </p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds debuted to decent numbers, registering a 52K concurrent player peak on Steam. However, those numbers are long gone - over the last week, the game has stayed below three thousand concurrent players at all times, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1374490/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. Anyway, RuneScape: Dragonwilds launched with support for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and DLAA, but a patch due today will also add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, boosting frame rates across the board for all owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>On Friday, July 11, Brickadia LLC will launch the namesake next-generation brick building sandbox game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199420/Brickadia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, where it is planned to stay until the end of 2026. In Brickadia, users have every creative tool, such as building, scripting, and more, available right in the game with real-time multiplayer enabled. That means they can work with friends to build massive worlds, intricate physics contraptions, and entirely new game modes without ever leaving the action. Some of the examples of things you can craft in Brickadia include skyscrapers, all sorts of vehicles, detailed islands, spaceships, and cityscapes.</p>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and supports hardware accelerated ray tracing, boosting UE5's own Lumen, as you can see below. To compensate for that performance cost, players will find NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA options available.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lastly, the Unreal Engine 5 sandbox indie MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-online-2-gets-epic-megagrant-will-migrate-to-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Online 2</a> will receive NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support later this month with its first expansion, Reckoning, <a href="https://www.mortalonline2.com/patch-notes-reckoning-ptr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently available for testing in the Public Test Realm</a>. The game already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-how-to-get-to-the-inventor/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the course of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, you will connect with all sorts of people as you attempt to bring the whole of Australia into the Chiral Network. While the vast majority of preppers are encountered as part of the story, a few are entirely optional, and can be missed if you don't listen to what characters tell Sam and if you don't explore the map fully.</p>



<p>One of these optional preppers is <strong>The Inventor</strong>, a rather peculiar guy who has decided to bring Australia's current isolation to the next level by living on an island off the coast of the continent. Looking at the island from afar, it seems impossible to reach The Inventor's shelter, as no roads or bridges are going through or over the sea of tar, but there are actually a few easy ways to reach the island, and you can even reach him as soon as you get to Australia from the Plate Gate if you so desire.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After reaching the beach closest to The Inventor's shelter, use your Odradek scanner to highlight areas where the tar is shallow. These areas, highlighted by yellow dots, can be traversed safely. Before you head out, however, <strong>look around the beach to find lost cargo for The Inventor</strong>, as he won't talk to you unlesss you have a delivery for him. Once you have loaded the cargo, you can follow the safe path, reach the shelter, and connect it to the Chiral Network.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if you are not a completionist who wants to see everything Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has to offer, there are still plenty of good reasons to unlock The Inventor as increasing the connection level with the prepper will unlock some <strong>useful items</strong>, including the Otter Head at level 1, the Stun Bomb at level 2, the Remote Stun Bomb at level 3, the Bola Stun Gun at level 4 and a Custom Hologram and a patch at level 5 with which you can customize your structures and backpack, respectively.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-vrr-feasible/</link>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 docked VRR support may be technically feasible, but there would be too many hurdles to make it a smooth plug-and-play feature.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry replied to a supporter's question asking if the dock's authentication chip is the reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't support VRR in docked mode, ruling out the possibility, as the authentication process is a separate process that takes place before any sort of output process begins. The reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 dock doesn't support VRR, Digital Foundry highlighted, has probably nothing to do with the dock, but rather with the Display Port to HDMI conversion through USB-C, which makes it difficult for VRR to work on the Steam Deck. Ultimately, Digital Foundry believes that VRR may be technically feasible, as it was recently proven how&nbsp;the dock can support it,&nbsp;but the hurdles to overcome may be too many to actually make it a smooth plug-and-play experience, which is what console users expect to find.</p>



<p>On a related note, the tech experts at Digital Foundry also commented on why so few Nintendo Switch 2 launch games do not support 40 FPS modes despite the 120 Hz panel making it a feasible option, saying that, at this time, not too many titles would benefit from it. At the same time, however, some games already supporting 40 FPS mode like Cyberpunk 2077, suggests that more titles will support it in the future, although it remains to be seen how many, especially if the VRR situation doesn't improve, as games would need to be locked at 40 FPS without VRR for a good experience.</p>
