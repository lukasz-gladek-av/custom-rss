			<p>Many fans of the series feel that Battlefield 6's maps are smaller than the rest of the series, and it seems like they were right, judging from a comparison put together by a member of the community.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bf1/">Battlefield subreddit</a>, user ClaraTheRed shared a couple of comparison images that show all of the series' 87 maps, their total and playable area, their shapes and how they rank in terms of size.</p>



<p>The findings are not in the Battlefield 6 maps' favor at all. The game's largest map, Operation Firestorm, a remade version of Battlefield 3's map, ranks 32nd in terms of playable space. It is also considerably smaller than the original, which ranks at 7th in terms of playable area.</p>



<p>Every other Battlefield 6 map ranks relatively low in the total ranking for playable space. Mirak Valley is the largest of the game's original maps, ranking 35th, while the smallest, Saints Quarter, is also the 2nd smallest map in the entire series. As such, those who felt that the game's maps were small were clearly onto something, even without doing an accurate comparison as the user ClaraTheRed did.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While many of the largest maps in the series were DLC maps released long after each respective game, there's no denying that Battlefield 6's maps do leave something to be desired in terms of playable space, even compared to the launch maps of previous entries in the series. With the community being rather vocal about this matter, it will be interesting to see if the developer will take this feedback into account for future maps, as they have been doing for some other aspects of the game, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://mp1st.com/news/after-community-backlash-devs-remove-battlefield-6s-neon-blue-skin">including the removal of a skin that the community felt didn't fit the setting at all.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>

			<p>Four years after the last Hyrule Warriors release, Omega Force, the studio behind Age of Calamity within Koei Tecmo, is set to release Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on November 6, 2025.</p>



<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment sets players in the Imprisoning War, the events of which would lead to the story that unfolds in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Princess Zelda fights alongside King Rauru and the legendary Sages, each with unique fighting styles that players can utilize in this musou-style game.</p>



<p>The latest trailer showcases a bit more gameplay ahead of launch, like the kinds of combination attacks you can perform with other characters to decimate waves of enemies. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>When Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity came out in 2020 on the Nintendo Switch, Wccftech's reviewer noted that one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-not-exactly-next-gen/">key drawbacks to the game was its poor framerate and performance</a>, writing, "<em>I genuinely had a minute where I was positive that the game's framerate had dropped into the single digits for a lengthy period of time. Playing co-op with two characters which both have heavy effects on their attacks is a recipe for a low framerate, and a low number of enemies being drawn on screen. It's a shame as co-op is still the best way to play any Warriors game, but the framerate sacrifice and loss of screen real-estate can make it feel more like a hassle than a fun way to play with friends.</em>"</p>



<p>Even though the game was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-3-million-copies/">sell over 3 million copies before the end of the year</a>, setting a new record for the Warriors series, its performance issues continued to be a refrain that harmed players' perception of the game.</p>



<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, has the chance to shirk the bad performance narrative if it's able to launch mostly issue-free thanks to the power of the Switch 2 hardware. Of course, it's naive to think any major game will launch completely without bugs, but hopefully we won't see the kinds of major performance issues that held back Age of Calamity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo: Campaign Evolved,</a> which confirmed that the longtime Xbox-exclusive series would be coming to PlayStation, GameStop posted a lengthy statement about it being the end of the console wars. The White House, of all entities, responded with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">AI-generated photo of Donald Trump in Spartan armor,</a> as if to depict him as the protagonist in Halo, Master Chief. Shortly after that, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) used more Halo imagery <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">to promote its own political agenda</a>, and has even followed it up with a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">similar post co-opting Lord of the Rings</a>. </p>



<p>And the DHS has made it clear that it will not stop there, which we know thanks to a report from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261">independent journalist Alyssa Mercante</a>, who obtained a statement from the DHS after inquiring about its use of Halo imagery. At the time of her inquiry, the Lord of the Rings post had not been made, though it would go out shortly after this statement was delivered: </p>



<p>"<em>We will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be Halo, Pokémon, Lord of The Rings, or any other medium. DHS remains laser focused on bringing awareness to the flood of crime that criminal illegal aliens have inflicted on our country. We aren’t slowing down. - DHS SPOX</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Microsoft has yet to make an official comment on the DHS using Halo to promote its own political agenda, nor has Amazon, which currently holds the rights to The Lord of the Rings, made a statement regarding whether the use of these images was approved. </p>



<p>Both Amazon and Microsoft, if they were so inclined, could have the images taken down, and while the lack of any statement doesn't explicitly confirm they agree with the posts in question and how they are being used, not saying anything at the very least admits that neither party will stop the DHS from continuing to use franchises like Halo and The Lord of the Rings in the future.</p>



<p>Individual Halo creators have made statements, however, with Marcus Lehto, a co-creator of Halo and the lead designer of the character Master Chief, told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react">Game File</a> that "<em>It really makes me sick seeing Halo co-opted like this</em>."</p>



<p>Jaime Griesemer, a lead designer of the original Halo games at Bungie, added, "<em>Halo is a cultural icon and like anything with cultural capital, it is going to be used by politicians and brands and anyone else looking for relevancy</em>. <em>Usually, I take it as a compliment to Halo’s continuing legacy</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Using Halo imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation</em>. <em>I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.</em>"</p>
