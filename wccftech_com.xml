			<p>After a pretty abysmal live stream where Bungie defeatedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">confirmed that one of its developers had lifted the work of another artist and put it in its new shooter</a>, Marathon, without permission, attribution, or compensation, you could practically taste the delay announcement incoming. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-rumor-of-no-marketing-plans-suggests-potential-delay/">A sudden lack of any marketing</a> for Marathon further pushed the rumour of a delay, and a month later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">by June 2025, it was official</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, we've not seen hide nor hair of Marathon (though Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">has been active with new Destiny 2 content</a>), and you would absolutely not be the first to have speculated that the game was never going to come back. Not so, it would seem. Bungie proved, at least to some degree, that Marathon is not dead, and has opened a new round of sign-ups for a Closed Technical Test taking place later this month.</p>



<p>The test is invite-only, and players wishing to participate will have to sign an NDA in order to do so. The test will run later this month, from October 22-27, 2025.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply">blog post on Bungie's website,</a> the studio adds that it has been running closed tests since June, and this is the first one it is looking to open up to more players. The test will include three maps, proximity chat, a solo queue, and "<em>re-tuned</em>" combat.</p>



<p>Bungie claims it'll talk more about what's next for Marathon at some point after the conclusion of the test. The last we heard about Marathon's release window is that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">currently set for sometime in March 2026</a>.</p>
