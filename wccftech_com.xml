			<p>According to two prominent insiders, Fortnite Season OG will return permanently in December. The news was reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1853920988594930095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1853920981682704412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShiinaBR</a>, who received the information from an anonymous source and were able to confirm its veracity. They also said all Fortnite Chapter 1 seasons would return monthly with an OG item pool. Moreover, both Build and Zero Build modes will be available. The announcement is expected at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards, which will take place at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Thursday, December 12, starting at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>Fortnite Season OG <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> for the first time last November, marking record player numbers for Epic. The first day after the relaunch, the Battle Royale game registered the biggest day in its history with more than 44.7 million players. It came at the right time, too: just a few months before, Epic had been forced to lay off sixteen percent of its workforce. Fortnite's comeback, which started with Season OG, was largely responsible for a much healthier state of the company's finances.</p>
<p>Epic seems to have figured out Fortnite users are really into nostalgia. Right now, there's the Chapter 2 Remix season <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-is-live-now-brand-new-kicks-cosmetics-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on live servers. Are you enjoying it? What do you think about these returning seasons? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>An Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro comparison video was shared online today, highlighting the improvements made possible by the soon-to-be-released mid-generation console by Sony.</p>
<p>The comparison, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, provides a new look at the game's ray-traced reflections on opaque and transparent surfaces exclusive to PS5 Pro between consoles, better shadows, volumetric lighting, and fog compared to quality mode on the base model and Xbox Series X, and performance mode settings comparable to quality mode on base console and Microsoft's most powerful current generation system. The video also highlights how PSSR delivers a much better image quality than AMD FSR 2 but also causes artifacts in some areas. Still, these are very impressive results for the first iteration of the upscaler.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake II | PS5 Pro - PS5 - Xbox Series X - PC | Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_p389l3GmPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 launched last year on PC and consoles and continues to be one of the most stunning survival horror games released in recent years. Last month, the game was expanded with The Lake House expansion, which serves as a clear introduction for the next story in the Remedy Connected Universe, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With its great atmosphere and tight story pacing, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House retains the same elements that made the base game so engaging. The lack of significant new mechanics and its very short length, however, make it a worthwhile purchase only for the most die-hard fans of Alan Wake 2 and the Remedy Connected Universe.</em></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test-highlights-how-the-console-can-brute-force-improvements-even-without-dedicated-patch.1028673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An early Elden Ring PlayStation 5 Pro test was shared online, showing how the console can brute force improvements in games even without a dedicated patch.</p>
<p>The test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil Pixel</a> reveals how the action role-playing game by FromSoftware often runs at native 4K resolution in Performance Mode while keeping close to 60 frames per second framerate most of the time. In Quality mode, on the other hand, performance is shakier but still manages to be close to 60 frames per second while constantly running at native 4K resolution. The biggest performance improvements, however, are seen with ray tracing, which is not surprising considering the console's GPU improvements over the base model.</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring - PS5 PRO - Resolution and Performance - Patch 1.17" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFbBlagU1VE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given how Elden Ring's performance on the base PlayStation 5 isn't as solid as it should have been, this is definitely good news, as a dedicated PS5 Pro patch would definitely make 4K resolution, 60 FPS gameplay possible. Even with its technical hiccups, however, the game is worth experiencing for fans of the Souls series, as it is the natural evolution of the successful formula created by FromSoftware, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring and its expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> on Monday, Warhorse Studios held their first Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer stream yesterday afternoon. The broadcast lasted over two hours and can now be replayed <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2294365343" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a> (although there are also captures available on YouTube). It featured Warhorse Global PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling and Art Director Viktor Höschl playing the game and discussing its features at length.</p>
<p>The duo talked about optimization, revealing that people will be surprised by the PC optimization. The PR Manager also said his personal PC powered by a GeForce RTX 3050 could run Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 'buttery smooth.' Moreover, he confirmed that the game won't include the Denuvo DRM on PC.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling:</strong> We are deep into optimizations and bug fixing. I'm extremely positive about the performance of the game and also about the state of the game if you're bothered by bugs. We will tell you the PC specs very soon. We are finishing it up. Right now, I can't tell you yet, but as you can see, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 runs, I think, at 80 FPS right now. I'm playing on a decent PC, of course. It's maybe even 90, so that is pretty good. I wouldn't be too worried.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Viktor Höschl:</strong> I think people will be really surprised by what kind of PC can run it.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling: </strong>Yes, absolutely, so don't worry about that. We learned from what we did in KCD. We took way more time than in the first game for bug fixing, optimization, performance testing, and so on. We are working on this right now and not only on PC but also on consoles for the console players, so there's good news for everyone. Give us a tiny little bit more time, but I think by the end of the year we should be able to tell you exactly what you should get. I personally at home play on a 3050 GPU I think, and it runs buttery smooth. As I said, give us some time on performance testing and we will tell you soon.</em></p>
<p><em>Now, the other thing is, and give me a second of your attention here, DRM. There's things floating here in the chat; there's things floating out in the Internet, and many of those things are absolutely fake news. You should be very careful with the stuff you trust and see. I can tell you right now the exact situation, and the exact situation is that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will not have Denuvo in there or any DRM system at all. We never confirmed it. There were some discussions, of course. There was some misalignment, there was some misinformation, but at the end of the day, there won't be any Denuvo at all.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 11, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Officially Confirmed to Be Backward Compatible]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible.1028592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the latest <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1853976778366443775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be backward compatible with Switch games. There have been rumors about this feature for a long time, and even the president of Nintendo America <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-possibly-hinted-at-by-nintendo-of-america-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at it around a year ago. However, getting it confirmed definitively is sure to make prospective fans happy.</p>
<p>Furukawa stated:</p>
<p><em>In addition to being able to play Nintendo Switch software they currently own, consumers will be able to choose their next purchase from a broad selection of titles released for Nintendo Switch.</em></p>
<p>More information on Nintendo Switch 2 backward compatibility is expected to be shared at a later date. The Japanese corporation still plans to announce the new console within the current fiscal year (that is to say, by March 2025).</p>
<p>Nintendo's financial results <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> yesterday weren't great. The company had to lower its sales forecast for the full year. However, in his briefing, Furukawa maintained that the Switch was still selling robustly compared to previous Nintendo platforms in their eighth year.</p>
<p>He then provided an analysis of why the Switch performed so well, attributing the platform's outstanding overall results not only to the great games but also to four key structural changes: merging the handheld and home console platforms into a single one; an emphasis on consumer touchpoints; reinforcing relationships with game developers; and regional expansion to growing markets.</p>
<p>The first point is arguably the most important one. On this subject, Furukawa-san explained:</p>
<p><em>Before Nintendo Switch, we offered two types of dedicated video game platforms: home consoles and handheld systems, each with its own unique set of titles. By merging these two platforms, Nintendo Switch became a unified platform where popular series from both home consoles and handheld systems come together in one place.</em></p>
<p><em>The merging of the two platforms allowed us to integrate our software development teams. By focusing our research and development on a single platform, we have achieved a more continuous stream of new titles without major gaps. With Nintendo Switch, we introduced the concept of a portable home console, which has been well-received by our consumers worldwide. Consumers now purchase Nintendo Switch for many reasons. Not only do we see first-time users, but we also see consumers purchase additional hardware to add to their collection or replace their hardware with newer ones. At the same time, ownership patterns have shifted from “one per family” to “one per person.” Although Nintendo Switch debuted as a home console, its sales also exhibit the characteristics of a handheld system.</em></p>
<p>That's why the Nintendo Switch 2 is also going to be a hybrid console. Whereas the Japanese corporation previously employed gimmicks that only lasted a generation (the Wiimote and the Wii U Gamepad, for instance), this shift to a handheld/home console combination will pay off dividends for multiple generations, given the consumer trend of playing on the go. After much experimentation, it looks like Nintendo has found a clear path forward.</p>
