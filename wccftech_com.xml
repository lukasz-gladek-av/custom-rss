			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> on PC got its <a href="https://support.nixxes.com/hc/en-us/articles/26565118695837-The-Last-of-Us-Part-II-Remastered-PC-Patch-1-1">second patch</a> from developer Nixxes. This update addresses crashing issues that players reported, an audio issue players had while watching the Grounded documentary, fixes for the sliders in the display menu, and more.</p>
<p>However, it does not address the autosave issues that players have reported to Nixxes, which Nixxes says it is still working to fix. For now, Nixxes suggests players try a workaround if they do run into the issue and a potential explanation as to why the problem is occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>"<em>Our investigation shows that issues can occur when OneDrive or similar cloud services block the save file from being written,</em>" Nixxes wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1910698603439444167">post on X</a>. "<em>As a workaround, we suggest that you pause OneDrive while playing the game: Right-click the OneDrive icon in the Windows taskbar, click the gear icon and Pause sync.</em>"</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered arrived on PC right at the beginning of April, and in just over a week, Nixxes has released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-hotfix/">two patches</a> for the game, addressing the big issues players were immediately reporting. At the pace Nixxes is working at, it likely won't take them too much longer to work out a fix for the autosave issue.</p>
<p>Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">dug into the PC port</a> for The Last of Us Part II Remastered when it arrived a little more than a week ago, and even without these patches, at the time he wrote that The Last of Us Part II Remastered "<em>is one of the best games ever made in its genre, and it is absolutely unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I. As such, it is hard not to recommend, even though it's an entirely straightforward, albeit not problematic, port</em>."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> publisher and developer Rebellion has announced that their new post-apocalyptic adventure in the British countryside has attracted more than <strong>2 million players</strong> within the game's first month.</p>
<p>Rebellion also shared a few in-game statistics about how players have been interacting with Atomfall, like the fact that players have killed more than 5.9 million enemies with cricket bats, ordered over 250,000 pints of beer, drunk 500,000 cups of tea and died from rat swarms more than 420,000 times. Rebellion also pointed out that 'tin of meat' is players' preferred in-game food choice, with more than 14.1 million tins of meat being consumed so far.</p>
<p>In the game's opening weekend, Atomfall surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/">1.5 million players</a>, so it's not surprising that it went well past 2 million within its first month of launch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It should also be pointed out that part of Atomfall reaching the audience it has is due in part to the game being available on Xbox Game Pass from day one. Still, even considering its inclusion in Microsoft's subscription service, 2 million players in weeks for a brand-new game is still an incredible feat.</p>
<p>Just one year ago, at the time of writing, there were no Fallout-esque games that took the adventure across the pond to the United Kingdom. Now, with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a> last July and Atomfall, we have two of them. This brings up an interesting point as to whether we'll start to see the same kind of post-nuclear apocalypse setting happening outside the United States more often.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">review</a> of Atomfall, we said, "<em>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, and encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</em></p>
