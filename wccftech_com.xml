			<p>The controversial GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, which includes the first three 3D entries in the series, was patched today on PC and consoles to bring over a highly requested change and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The patch</a>, which is now live on all PC storefronts, Xbox, and PlayStation, introduces the Classic Lighting Mode introduced in the mobile version of the collection last year. This mode restores the look and feel of the sky of the original games. To better highlight the differences between the vanilla lighting and the Classic Lighting Mode, Rockstar Games shared some comparison screenshots taken from the PC versions of all three games at maxed-out settings. You can check them out below.</p>

<p>Having not been updated in a long time, it seemed like Rockstar Games was done with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition patches, but thankfully, that was not the case, as the new Lighting Mode is a considerable improvement over the vanilla lighting. Some lingering issues still remain, but there's no doubt the remasters are in a much better state now than they were at release. You can learn more about these issues by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">launch review.</a></p>
<p>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/aukey-magfusion-gamefrost-cooling-wireless-charger-for-mobile-gamers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><b>November 12, 2024</b> - Leading charger brand <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/aukey-magfusion-gamefrost-wireless-charger-review" target="_blank">AUKEY</a> today announces the availability of its <a href="https://www.aukey.com/discount/GAMEFROST10?redirect=%2Fproducts%2Flc-g10-magfusion-gamefrost-magnetic-wireless-charger-with-active-cooling-system" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">MagFusion GameFrost Magnetic Active Cooling Wireless Charger</a> in the United States. The Qi2-certified charger features AUKEY’s proprietary Omnia-Frez active cooling technology, delivering fast 15W wireless charging for iPhone 12 and later models running on iOS 17.2 and above while maintaining low temperatures even during intense gaming sessions. In short, the MagFusion GameFrost is a must-have for mobile gamers seeking the ultimate gaming experience.</p>
<p>The MagFusion GameFrost, part of AUKEY's MagFusion Pro Qi2 wireless charger series, was showcased at IFA Berlin 2024, garnering considerable attention. The series differentiates itself from traditional wireless chargers through its advanced Omnia-Frez cooling system, featuring a Thermoelectric Cooling (TEC) chip at its core, which provides exceptional cooling capabilities. The system also features a high-velocity fan, silicone thermal pad, and alloy cooling fins to enhance heat dissipation.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The system can reduce charging temperatures by up to 20°C (68°F), providing a safer, more stable charging environment. This innovative feature is particularly beneficial during extended smartphone use, especially mobile gaming. By lowering the temperature, the device not only prevents overheating but also avoids performance drops and lag caused by high temperatures. As a result, gamers can enjoy a smooth, uninterrupted experience with a cool, comfortable feel. Additionally, the charger’s IML temperature display allows users to monitor temperature changes at a glance in real-time.</p>
<p>According to data from AUKEY Lab, the MagFusion GameFrost can charge an iPhone 16 Pro to 50% in an impressive 35 minutes. This efficiency not only minimizes downtime for users but also supports battery health by maintaining cooler charging temperatures, which helps to reduce battery wear over time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In addition to the Omnia-Frez cooling system, the MagFusion GameFrost innovatively offers a personalized experience that sets it apart from traditional wireless chargers, reflecting AUKEY's user-centric design philosophy. The device features dedicated buttons for wireless charging, cooling, and lighting control. When the battery is sufficiently charged, users can disable wireless charging and use the device solely as a cooling solution. Users can also switch between three cooling modes for optimal thermal management, and two LED lighting modes for a personalized atmosphere, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
<p>Lastly, the MagFusion GameFrost is intuitive and easy to use. Users can simply snap their phone onto the charger’s strong magnetic holder to activate wireless charging and cooling with immediate effect. The charging pad’s smooth glass surface ensures a perfect scratch-free fit with the iPhone, while the back panel's curves and angles accommodate various hand shapes and grips.</p>
<p>MagFusion GameFrost retails at <strong>$42.99</strong> and is available for sale on <a href="https://www.aukey.com/discount/GAMEFROST10?redirect=%2Fproducts%2Flc-g10-magfusion-gamefrost-magnetic-wireless-charger-with-active-cooling-system" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">AUKEY’s official website</a>.</p>

			<p>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-series-creator-reportedly-going-to-netease-while-tencent-is-rumored-to-be-acquiring-a-japanese-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> SEGA three years ago to join NetEase, where he <a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> his own Tokyo-based studio to make global console games.</p>
<p>The game designer was featured in a lengthy interview with Japanese magazine Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> yesterday. Nagoshi talked about various topics, but the most interesting tidbit is arguably that he believes the era where game size is the selling point will soon pass.</p>
<p><em>What I'm making now is an action adventure. After the experimental phase and the phase where the experiments are exhausted, we will move on to the phase of mass-producing assets, but I think it would be good if you thought of it as being on the eve of the mass-production phase. In that sense, it's going well, but in many ways, it's a bit large in scale. In addition, at first glance, the game system is complicated. But I don't want to make it a troublesome game... Well, it's difficult to talk about what I can't say at this point.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I want to make it a game that is satisfying to play, but I don't want it to be a hassle. Even though there aren't many completely new games out there, there are so many titles out there that you can't play them all, including overseas. Looking at the situation, I think the volume of console games in the lives of average game fans may be a bit excessive. There are still many titles out there, but I feel that the era of games where volume is the selling point is about to pass.</em></p>
<p>The interesting thing is that he admits his next game is also going to be large in scale, which isn't surprising given that his last game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, required 45.5 hours just for the main quest, while a completionist playthrough can take an average of 103 hours, according to How Long To Beat.</p>
<p>Anyway, Nagoshi said his team is currently assessing the proper size for this game, though the map they've created is already large - maybe too much.</p>
<p><em>One characteristic that is particularly relevant in overseas markets is that a certain amount of volume is necessary, and although there is a sense that "it has to be at least this much," I think that this is also a kind of fixed idea. So we continue to discuss, "What is the appropriate volume at the time of releasing the game?" I'm currently thinking hard about how to predict or measure that volume and how to arrange the game's density to suit the appropriate volume and size.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We will soon have to enter the mass production phase of assets, so it will soon be time to decide on the final volume estimate, but we are currently thinking about whether this is really good enough. Of course, we have a map, but the one at the current stage is too large. I started by studying existing games and creating a fairly large map. I had already created roads and highways. Now, I'm shrinking it little by little and looking for a good balance for the game.</em></p>
<p>The Yakuza creator also revealed that the team size is around 80. He'd like to share more about the project in the near future, too. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch is among the best ones to date, introducing new options that provide a deeper insight into the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler alongside great visual and performance improvements.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry analyzed the game's PS5 Pro patch, highlighting the new features that it introduces and how it takes advantage of the console's power and features. The patch replaces the standard Performance Mode with a PS5 Pro Enhanced mode that uncaps the framerate so that those with a 120Hz screen with VRR can enjoy a high framerate experience that consistently runs at above 60 FPS, hitting the 100 FPS range rather often.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch, however, is the new Scaling options, which include PSSR anti-aliasing and the TAA option the game has featured since launch. These options, which can be switched on the fly, provide a great insight into the performance cost of the PSSR upscaler, which does a great job enhancing the image quality and the perception of distant detail using the same 1440p base resolution as TAA but does impact performance. In one of the game's most CPU-intensive scenarios, using PSSR over TAA made the game run at 10 frames per second less or more. As such, this essentially confirms the PSSR cost on performance of 2ms every frame that was revealed in the internal documents leaked a few months ago.</p>
<p>Rounding out the improvements the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch brings in its new enhanced mode is the presence of all the image quality features seen in the base game's Quality Mode, including the light ray tracing for the scene-aligned cube maps, which is still not available in the PC version of the game. All of these features make the patch one of the best released to date, enhancing the experience considerably in both image quality and performance over the base model.</p>
