			<p>Per Famitsu's sales records published by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/famitsu-sales-9-1-25-9-7-25">Gematsu</a>, the PlayStation 5 has surpassed<strong> 7 million units sold in Japan</strong> as of September 7, 2025.</p>



<p>After the console hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million units shipped last month,</a> this is the latest hardware milestone reached, with an estimated 7,009,937 units sold in Japan between the PlayStation 5 Pro and the digital and physical versions of the base PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>It's leagues above the Xbox Series family of consoles, which have, according to the same list of Famitsu's latest numbers, sold only an estimated 682,927 units between the Xbox Series X/S, and is starting to catch up with the PlayStation 4, which has sold approximately 7,929,886 units in its lifetime.</p>



<p>The fact that PlayStation 5 is already catching up to the PS4 in the region shows how strong sales are in Japan for this current generation, though by that same token, it also shows just how strong the PlayStation 4's presence was in Japan, and how the PS5 continues to lag behind its predecessor in Japan, and across the world. And recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price increases to the console across the globe</a> certainly won't help move units. </p>



<p>That said, when it comes to videogame console sales in Japan, PlayStation continues to be dwarfed by Nintendo and its family of consoles. The Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold an estimated 1,980,483, while the Nintendo Switch has sold an estimated 35,969,655 since 2017.</p>

			<p>Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/chapter-2-free-update-and-lost-harvest-dlc-out-now/">launched</a> the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-free-story-update-the-lost-harvest-dlc-free-trial/">major paid and free DLCs</a> for Dune: Awakening, with Chapter 2 of the game's core narrative as the free DLC available for everyone, and a standalone storyline called The Lost Harvest being the paid DLC. Both are live in the game at the time of this writing, making this week an exciting time for players who've been on Arrakis since launch earlier this year. But if you've not begun your journey on Arrakis, you can try it out this weekend with Dune: Awakening's first free weekend that's live from today, September 11, to this Monday, September 15.</p>



<p>The free update that's currently live continues the main campaign of the game, continuing the story beyond the conclusion of Act 3 and revealing more of the dark mystery that brought you to Arrakis. Other elements of the free update include being able to re-customize your character, add new customizations with new hairstyles and tattoos, new contracts, armors, more dynamic encounters, improvements to combat and exploration, and the removal of the quicksand border that blocked players from entering the Deep Desert on foot or ground vehicles.</p>

<p>The Lost Harvest DLC adds a few more tidbits for players who purchase the DLC separately or those who bought the Season Pass or the Deluxe Edition of Dune: Awakening. Players with access to The Lost Harvest DLC get access to new ground vehicles, new building pieces, armor sets, cosmetic customizations for your base and gear, weapon skins, and a new emote.</p>

<p>Funcom has also released the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-chapter-2-patch-notes/">patch notes</a> for the Chapter 2 update, which include all the above changes, and a slew of bug fixes and balance tweaks.</p>



<p>Right now, Dune: Awakening remains a PC-exclusive title, but if you're a console player who can't wait to jump into your own journey on Arrakis, then, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-launch-console-cross-play-sony-microsoft/">what Funcom told Wccftech at Gamescom 2025</a>, you can look forward to the game's launch on consoles at its one-year anniversary.</p>
