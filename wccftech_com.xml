			<p>Xbox gaming revenues have declined by $113 million, or 2%, due to drop in hardware sales and limited growth of gaming content and services in Q1 FY2026 over the prior year, Microsoft confirmed in its latest financial report.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the company reported its<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast"> Q1 FY2026 earnings</a>, confirming the Xbox hardware revenue 29% decline, which is offset in part by growth in Xbox content and services, whose $5.5 billion revenue is a 1% improvement over the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"strong prior year"</em>. This revenue increase was driven by growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content, and partially offset by a decline in first-party content.</p>



<p>Xbox hardware sales declining is hardly surprising, as console sales were already down 22% last quarter. With the current generation almost at the end, increasing prices, and a multiplatform strategy that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">bringing tentpole franchises like Halo to the PlayStation 5</a>, no improvement was to be expected. </p>



<p>Considering the above, it will be very interesting to see how much of a difference the next-generation Xbox will make. The new system will reportedly be <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a very premium experience</a> combining <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">the best of the PC and console worlds</a>, but its popularity could be severely impacted by its price, which is <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">expected to be much higher than the price of the PlayStation 6.</a></p>

			<p>Work on Valve's HLX project, rumored to be the highly anticipated Half-Life 3, is continuing with more optimization passes, suggesting that the project's polishing phase is in full swing.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McVicker</a>, who provided correct updates on Valve's project for years before their official announcements, reviewed some of the additions made to the Source 2 engine with the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4522268822998171356">Counter-Strike 2 October 15 update.</a></p>



<p>Unlike past updates, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">introduced new systems and features that aren't in use in any other game powered by the Valve engine</a>, the latest update focuses more on optimization and polishing, introducing an automated process to clean up system resources, changes to the sound simulation and liquid simulation systems, and more. </p>



<p>Though in a smaller number than before, new features likely meant for Half-Life 3 HLX have also been added by the latest Counter-Strike 2 update to the Source 2 engine, such as an expanded damage group system to take into account enemy models other than humanoid, and an asynchronous particle simulation system which will compute particles interfacing with simulated wind speed, allowing wind speed to adjust how the particles react on a case-by-case basis as well.</p>



<p>The most notable addition, and the one that is sparking the most discussion in the community, is the introduction of a new icon that denotes a new group of assets labeled as <em>"science"</em>. Tyler McVicker speculates that this doesn't mean much for Half-Life 3 HLX, as, from every update seen to date, the game is clearly in a polishing phase where no assets are being added. Though this usually is the final development phase, Valve could take years to complete it, so there's no indication the game is any close to release.</p>



<p>However, something could be brewing, and the game's release could not be too far in the future. According to rumors, a trailer for Half-Life 3 HLX is being worked on, and if how Valve handled Half-Life Alyx marketing and release is any indication, the game should be launching shortly after its announcement. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Tyler McVicker speculates that something related to Half-Life 3 HLX can happen in November, we have to take any potential reveal date with a massive grain of salt, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">previous reveal windows ended up not being correct</a>. As of now, only one thing seems to be almost for sure: the Half-Life series is far from being done.</p>

			<p>Though updated in every possible way, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake retains the challenge of its classic JRPG roots. If you are a newcomer to the series, understanding some essential quirks is key to enjoying both games right from the start. This guide will walk you through settings, exploration, and combat tips to tame the difficulty.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: Tips devised and refined during two complete playthroughs of both games over the course of 45 hours at Dragon Quest difficulty in the game's PlayStation 5 1.0 version. Screenshots captured from the same version.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-3-essential-settings-to-tame-dragon-quest-i-amp-ii-hd-2d-remake-s-challenge">3 Essential Settings To Tame Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake's Challenge</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D features some really helpful features that can improve the experience of anyone who isn't a series veteran</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake features some new settings the original games and their many remakes didn't. Unless you are a hardcore series veteran who wants to be challenged, you must change some of them to have an easier time with both games.</p>



<p>The first settings to turn on are found in the <strong>System Settings menu's Helpful Settings section</strong> (Triangle/X/Y button on the field - Misc.- System Settings). These are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Treasure Chest Locations</strong> - Adds icons on the mini-map indicating treasure chests</li>



<li><strong>Secret Spots</strong> - Adds icons on the world map indicating the general location of Secret Spots, where you can find additional items, gear, Scrolls and Mini Medals</li>
</ul>



<p>The third setting to turn on is found inside the Difficulty Settings section of the System Settings menu:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recover HP/MP When Levelling Up</strong> - Restores HP and MP fully every time any character levels up</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Turning on these features vastly improves both games significantly for the majority of players due to both games' high challenge level and encounter rate. The Treasure Chests and Secret Spots indicators will cut down the time needed to explore locations fully, making you get into fewer random encounters. Restoring HP and MP fully upon level up allows you to explore dungeons for longer without being forced to return to a town to rest at an inn and heal up, improving both games' pace quite a bit for a more enjoyable experience.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-leave-no-stone-unturned">Leave No Stone Unturned</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>A lot of items can be found by searching everywhere in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D, including very useful Scrolls</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exploration and traversal in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is quite straightforward, but this doesn't mean that the colorful world of both games isn't hiding all sorts of secrets, including powerful gear, Scrolls, consumable items that can teach characters some new spells or abilities, or the elusive Mini Medals that can be exchanged for other useful items.</p>



<p>While shining spots on the field and treasure chests are the most obvious indications that new items can be obtained, they aren't the only places you should search. Whenever you reach a new town, explore every house, check every <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">drawer, cabinet, bookshelf</strong>,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> pot or barrel</strong>. Same inside any dungeon: even if a path doesn't seem to lead to treasure, there's a good chance something may be hidden inside a stray pot. Take your time to explore the world fully, and you will be thankful for it.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)">In RPGs where critical gear costs a lot, where you often cannot afford to buy everything at Weapon and Armor shops, any extra equipment you can find is critical. Even if you don't need an item you have foun</em></strong><strong><em>d</em></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)">, you can sell it at any shop and get extra gold to spend on anything you may need.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-stock-up-on-healing-items">Stock Up On Healing Items</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Stocking healing items is crucial to survive in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, the descendants of Erdrick learn plenty of healing spells to heal their wounds quickly, but the limited MP pools, and the scarce availability of MP restoration items force you to think hard about which spells to use and when to use them.</p>



<p>As such, <strong>healing items should be the core of your healing strategy</strong>, more than MP-consuming spells. Thankfully, Medicinal Herbs and Strong Medicine, which heal HP by 30 and 50 HP respectively, are quite cheap to purchase, and can be stocked up in your Item Bag by the hundreds. However, make sure to transfer these healing items to your characters, as <strong>no item stored in the Item Bag can be used in battle</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>If you use the Tactics auto-battle options a lot, having a healthy stock of healing items has another important benefit. Every option besides Show No Mercy heals characters when needed, and will use items if no healing spell is available, unless you set your characters to not use items with auto-battle settings active.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-use-tactics-as-often-as-possible">Use Tactics As Often As Possible</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <strong>Tactics</strong> feature in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake offers a few auto-battle settings that can be quite effective. These settings are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Show No Mercy</strong> - Characters fight with everything they got</li>



<li><strong>Fight Wisely</strong> - Characters strike a balance between offense and defense</li>



<li><strong>Focus on Healing</strong> - Characters prioritize healing above all else</li>



<li><strong>Don't Use MP</strong> - Characters fight and heal without using MP</li>



<li><strong>Watch My Back</strong> (Dragon Quest II HD-2D only) - Characters focus exclusively on healing, leaving damage dealing to other party members.</li>
</ul>



<p>Generally in any JRPG, you want to have direct control of your characters, but in Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, these options work remarkably well in random encounters. By assigning these settings individually, you can have party members in Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake focus on specific strategies, and you can even tweak which spells or what item types can be used with the Tactics auto-battle options to further enhance your strategies. With how many random encounters you will get into during the course of these epic adventures, Tactics can <strong>make you save a lot of precious time</strong>, and improve the pace of the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Every Tactics auto-battle setting with the exception of Show No Mercy has a hidden mechanic that can help your party stay alive against powerful enemies. Unlike a human player who cannot predict which character is going to be hit, the AI can, and thus can take advantage of turn order to provide emergency healing to a character hit by an unexpected critical hit.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-don-t-be-afraid-to-lower-difficulty">Don't Be Afraid to Lower Difficulty</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although not as unforgiving as the original NES releases and some of their subsequent remakes, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is still <strong>a challenging experience that can get you off guard</strong>. Even if you have set up your party properly, ready for every contingency, there will be times when you will have to deal with some unexpected difficulty spikes due to powerful enemies, some capable of acting twice out of turn, appearing out of the blue. This is all part of the Dragon Quest series experience, so veterans are fully prepared to deal with this.</p>



<p>However, if you are a newcomer, <strong>don't be afraid to drop the difficulty to Dracky Quest</strong>, the easiest setting available. If you turn off Invincibility, which makes both games literal walks in the park, this difficulty setting can still provide a solid level of challenge to a newcomer without overwhelming them with massive difficulty spikes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Difficulty can be lowered at any time via the System Settings menu, so the experience can be quite flexible, allowing you to experience Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake at a variable difficulty setting. No content is locked behind difficulty, so change it away if you're finding the hordes of fiends too challenging for you.</em></strong></p>

These items will be distributed in Fortnite following the game's release, which, as a reminder, is set for February 27, 2026.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>CAPCOM also unveiled a special edition Resident Evil Requiem Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, featuring art from the game and styled in gunmetal-inspired black. It will be available from Nintendo on launch day. Lastly, it was revealed that Grace will become the first-ever Resident Evil amiibo, available sometime in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>Following the opening of pre-orders, the publisher also shared the minimum and recommended system requirements for the PC version. These are surprisingly accessible.</p>



<p><strong>MINIMUM:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11 (64-bit required)<br>Processor: Intel corei5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: GeForce GTX 1660 6GB / Radeon RX 5500 XT 8GB<br>DirectX: Version 12</p>
