			<p>KONAMI has confirmed in <a href="https://www.konami.com/videonews/movie_view.html?movie_url=6382868806112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new video report</a> posted on the publisher's official website (as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/silent-hill-2-remake-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Gematsu</a>) that the Silent Hill 2 remake has now surpassed two and a half million units sold. Meanwhile, the series as a whole has finally surpassed ten million units sold to date.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-2-million-units-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had reached two million units in late January</a>. Clearly, sales have greatly slowed down since, but the game is still a commercial success. Indeed, KONAMI has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that developer Bloober Team would also remake the first entry in the survival horror franchise.</p>



<p>Before the game's launch around a year ago, there were many skeptics about Bloober Team's capability to deliver a remake worthy of the revered original. However, the final product swept those worries away, winning widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike. I<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n Wccftech's review</a>, it earned a 9 out of 10 score from Chris Wray:</p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>Even better for the series is that even the new game made by NeoBards Entertainment, Silent Hill f, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned the same score</a>. Here's what Francesco De Meo had to say about it:</p>



<p><em>With an engaging story full of haunting, disturbing sequences, a finely tuned balance of everything that makes survival horror great, and combat deeply rooted in resource management, Silent Hill f is a triumphant return for the series after its long hiatus. Its short length and minor PC performance issues may disappoint some, but no fan of the franchise, or the genre, should miss one of the best survival horror releases in years.</em></p>
