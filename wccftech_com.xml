			<p>Wreckreation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">the open-world sandbox</a> driving game <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">that lets you edit the world as you go</a>, which was developed by Three Fields Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">a studio made up of former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the Burnout series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past October</a>. Now, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry has announced that the entire staff at Three Fields Entertainment has been told they could potentially lose their jobs.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's launch has been marred by technical issues, though Sperry doesn't directly cite a lacklustre launch for the game as a reason for putting the entire staff at risk of redundancy. </p>



<p>"<em>Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career. After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy</em>," Sperry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-activity-7402348277788057600-slcG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">began in her post on LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard — with heart and dedication — to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future. We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful.</em>"</p>



<p>Sperry's post also includes a video featuring post-launch content the studio is adding to Wreckreation in the hopes that it will bolster the game's audience while the team also works to correct the technical problems players faced at launch.</p>



<p>"<em>My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," </em>Sperry continued<em>. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team. I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it."<p>"To everyone who has supported us, played our games, or believed in our studio: thank you. Your support has meant the world -&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, again at our own cost, ensure the&nbsp;next update that includes a Crossplay feature does get published before Christmas and we hope you and your friends can enjoy the world that we have built together, whichever platform you play on.</p></em>"</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the second major release from Three Fields Entertainment to miss its mark. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dangerous-driving-high-speed/">Dangerous Driving in 2019 earned a 5/10 from Wccftech</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dangerous-driving/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4">stands at a 62 on Metacritic</a>. At the time, Wccftech's Nathan Birch wrote, "<em>Dangerous Driving is, at best, a rough early prototype of a proper Burnout successor. The basic mechanics and sense of speed are there, but they’re badly undermined by bland track design, infuriating AI, a lack of features, and a host of other issues. Those feeling nostalgic for Burnout would be best served taking the classics out for another spin, rather than taking a chance on this lemon.</em>"</p>

			<p>Russia is off the board for Roblox, as the country's media regulatory body, the Roskomnadzor, blocks the game from Russian citizens. Included in its reasons for the block is the safety of children with regard to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-puts-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-of-children/">multiple reports</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">abuse and child predators</a> on the platform and the Roskomnadzor's concern that children will be exposed to what it defines as "<em>inappropriate content</em>," including in-game LGBTQ+ content.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/25806963">local Russian publication TASS</a> and spotted by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn41q11gy58o">BBC News</a>, the Roskomnadzor cited the platform being "<em>rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children</em>."</p>



<p>In response, a Roblox spokesperson said, "<em>We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have a deep commitment to safety, and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform</em>."</p>



<p>Roblox may be one of the more high-profile titles to be blocked by the Roskomnadzor, but it is hardly the first. Just last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">a solitaire game was banned on Steam in Russia for its LGBTQ+ content</a>. And while much of the world would not agree with Russia's assessment that LGBTQ+ content is negative for the moral development of children, the overwhelming amount of reports and litigation that Roblox has faced over its lacklustre protections for children, which have resulted in predators abusing and assaulting kids, is not an unfair reason to block the popular game.</p>



<p>Roblox has been trying to make the platform a safer place for kids, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat/"> just last month introduced age verification via facial recognition to unlock the ability to use in-game chat features</a>. Despite its issues and ongoing litigation, Robox continues to grow, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">recently set a peak concurrent users record that surpassed Steam's overall concurrent record</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-xbox-pc-march-2026/</link>

			<p>REPLACED, the 2.5D pixel-art-based cyberpunk platformer that was first showcased at E3 2021 and was arguably one of the most exciting prospective Xbox exclusives at the time of its reveal, finally has a release date, and will arrive on PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, and on Xbox Series X/S this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>This announcement follows developer Sad Cat Studios' announcement in August 2025 that it could confirm, "<em>with confidence</em>," <a href="https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-spring-2026-cyberpunk-platformer/">that REPLACED would be out by Spring 2026</a>. That confidence has clearly not waned, and we now have a release date for a game that, by the looks of its release date trailer, hasn't lost any of the special quality players saw in that 2021 reveal.</p>



<p>The new trailer is the best look at the game we've gotten in the years since its initial announcement, and backed by an original song from the game's soundtrack titled "<em>Dusk</em>," it appears to be firing on all cylinders ahead of its March release.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REPLACED Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuUo7_VaboE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As to why Sad Cat Studios took as long as it did to get to this point, it wasn't because Sad Cat Studios was toiling away, working on the game non-stop and burning time. Development was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">interrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, pushing it to the point we're at now, where a game that would have otherwise come out somewhere between 2021 and 2023 is out in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>We know that our community is incredibly excited to play REPLACED and it's no secret that it's taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all - we apologize for that,</em>" said game director Yura Zhdanovich in a press release back in August when the studio announced the release window. "<em>We've always tried to do what's right for the project,</em> <em>which in turn means delivering to you a truly special experience."</em></p>



<p>We'll see what Sad Cat Studios has for players when REPLACED launches on PC and Xbox Series X/S on March 12, 2026.</p>
