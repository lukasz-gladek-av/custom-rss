			<p>Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the first entry in the series, will launch this summer on PC and consoles, marking the classic third-person shooter series' debut on PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>The remaster, which was announced today with a new post on the official <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox website</a>, is being developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, and will be the most complete version of the game, featuring all the content included in the Gears of War: Ultimate Edition such as the main campaign, all post-launch DLC such as the bonus Campaign act, all multiplayer maps and modes, and a roster of classic characters and cosmetics that can be unlocked through progression.</p>
<p>Besides featuring all this content, Gears of War: Reloaded will enhance the original experience on all platforms with 4K resolution support, 60 FPS gameplay in the campaign and 120 FPS gameplay in multiplayer, HDR support, VRR support, enhanced post-processing visual effects, improved shadows and reflections, super resolution with improved antialiasing and zero loading screens during the Campaign. No matter which system the game is played on, signing with a Microsoft account unlocks full cross-platform functionality, enabling cross-progression and cross-platform multiplayer, including the ability to send invites to players across all systems. Cross-platform multiplayer will still be available even without a Microsoft account.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support the full set of Unreal Engine 5 features, but the hardware will likely have trouble running all of them simultaneously.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on how the soon-to-be-released new Nintendo system will handle games powered by the Unreal Engine 5 using features like Nanite, Lumen, and Virtual Shadow Maps. While it's obviously impossible to say for sure at this time, chances are high that games powered by the engine will likely be unable to use all the above features at the same time, not even targeting 30 FPS with significant compromises in terms of resolution, image quality, and performance. Recently, we have seen the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X struggle to run UE5-powered games using all three features, and the Nintendo Switch 2 would struggle even more, considering its hardware.</p>
<p>All the above, however, doesn't mean that we won't see Unreal Engine 5-powered games using these features on Nintendo Switch 2, only not all of them at the same time. According to Digital Foundry, how Fortnite runs on the system is a good indication of what should be expected on the console for UE5 games. The popular battle royale game was shown running at 60 FPS, but without Lumen, which has proven to be highly demanding in a test conducted by the tech experts featuring The Matrix Awakens demo<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/"> ported to the latest public version of the engine</a> running on comparable PC hardware with an Ampere architecture GPU. With Lumen, the demo ran poorly even at low resolution, and with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode, the feature is the prime candidate, together with the demanding Virtual Shadow Maps, that will be cut or heavily cut down to achieve acceptable performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #212: Big Xbox Price Hikes, Doom The Dark Ages Path Tracing, Far Cry 4 60FPS!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAW38VTIJQ?start=6242&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the system may struggle with the complete set of Unreal Engine 5 features, the Nintendo Switch 2 handles Cyberpunk 2077 rather well, so there's a solid chance the system will be pushed beyond expectations once developers get more comfortable developing games for it. We won't have to wait much longer to finally see what the system will be capable of, as it finally launches worldwide on June 5th.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/</link>

			<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/author-sues-bungie-for-copyright-infringement-over-destiny-2s-story">Last year</a>, writer Matthew Kelsey Martineau filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Bungie, claiming that the studio had stolen his work to create the story for Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Martineau claimed that Destiny 2's Red Legion was pulled straight from his work, which was published on WordPress in 2013 and 2014. Bungie responded with a motion to dismiss the case, saying (per <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-pushes-back-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit/">TheGamePost</a>) that Martineau's claim "<em>failed to plausibly allege that Bungie copied constituent elements of Plaintiff's work that are original, and, specifically, that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege factual copying by Bungie and that the works incorporated by reference into the Complaint are not substantially similar as a matter of law</em>."</p>
<p>Demonstrating that has become an issue, however, as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/court-denies-bungie-dismiss-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-youtube-wiki/">TheGamePost</a> reports that the court denied Bungie's dismissal claim because Bungie cannot provide the court with the original content from Destiny 2 to demonstrate the differences between Bungie and Martineau's work. Bungie can't provide the court with Destiny 2's original content because it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-content-removed-vault-beyond-light-november/">vaulted</a>, and it's now incompatible with the modern-day version of Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Bungie game director Tyson Green described why Bungie can't provide the game's original content, clarifying that "<em>the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' legacy builds can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework, which has evolved considerably since the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns were retired</em>."</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Bungie, Green's statement wasn't enough for Judge Susie Morgan, who won't accept YouTube videos of the game's original content or wikis as admissible evidence.</p>
<p>"<em>While Plaintiff does reference Destiny 2 in his complaint</em>," Judge Morgan's dismissal decision reads, "<em>he does not reference the YouTube videos containing Destiny 2 game footage, the Destinypedia pages, or the Tyson declaration.</em>"</p>
<p>Judge Morgan acknowledged that this is an extremely complicated copyright case and not typical compared to previous examples of copyright infringement, which also seems to be part of why the case is moving forward at all.</p>
<p>Vaulting content has never been popular with Destiny players, and while Bungie certainly has its reasons for doing so, those decisions are seemingly coming back to bite them in more ways than just facing the ire of players.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is undoubtedly the best-looking version of the open-world game developed by Rockstar Games, but this doesn't stop modders from taking the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>A new 4K resolution video shared by Digital Dreams shows the latest version of the fifth entry in the series by Rockstar Games running with mods such as <a href="https://www.patreon.com/crxhvrd/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreFx</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/lively-world-for-124497674">Lively World</a>, two known graphics and immersion improvement mods released for the original version of the game that were later ported to the Enhanced Edition. Needless to say, the two mods introduce noticeable enhancements that can make players forget the game initially released over a decade ago and possibly make the wait for the next entry in the series more bearable.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K100] GTA 5 Enhanced: modded CoreFX - Lively World BeyondallLimits RTX5090 RAYTRACING Graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juHYo9QMU54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of the Rockstar Games series will have to make do with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition for a while longer to experience the best the series has to offer, as Grand Theft Auto VI will not release as initially scheduled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Last week</a>, Rockstar confirmed the game will now release on May 26th, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as the studio requires additional development time to deliver the level of quality fans expect. While the public was only informed of the delay last week, the fact that the game would slip to 2026 was known for a while at Rockstar Games, due in part to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">a real desire to avoid crunch</a>, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about how this new version of the game breathes new life into the popular open-world game by checking out Alessio's analysis.</p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available for download allows users to easily tweak additional graphics settings not available in-game without modifying engine configuration files directly.</p>
<p>The Expedition 33 - Unreal Config tool, created by Bighead and now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/119?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, is a very handy tool that creates and configures engine configuration files for the game, allowing users to tweak additional graphics settings not available in-game to achieve better visuals, performance, or both. The tool, which is compatible with both the Steam and the Xbox Game Pass versions of the game, also comes with some built-in presets that can be selected as a base configuration to help users tweak these settings.</p>
<p>Though plenty of mods have been developed for the game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is absolutely enjoyable in its vanilla form, as it is one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. With an incredibly compelling story, a charming cast of endearing characters, and excellent gameplay, the debut game from Sandfall Interactive is well worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
