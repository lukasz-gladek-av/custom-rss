			<p>A port of Grand Theft Auto IV for current generation consoles may release this year, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1921889318588567785%7Ctwgr%5E82c5c40957329ef83365f87a424dd45beb955192%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fvideotechuk_%2Fstatus%2F1921889318588567785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@videotechuk_</a> on X, well-known Rockstar leaker Tez2 recently revealed that someone at Rockstar hinted at a port of the fourth entry in the series in the past, and by now, it should have been in development for a year. This port could be released before the end of 2025, and this is one of the reasons the Liberty City Preservation Project, which recreated the entirety of the Grand Theft Auto IV main city in GTA V, was taken down, alongside other unspecified existing reasons.</p>
<p>The fourth entry in the popular open-world series may not be the only now-classic game developed by Rockstar Games that could be released on modern systems in the future. According to Tez2, if Rockstar Games continues to follow its older plans, a modern port of Max Payne 3 could follow the Grand Theft Auto IV port, giving Take-Two the opportunity to release a bundle or Definitive Edition coinciding with the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a> in the works by Remedy Entertainment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">According to Tez, the long anticipated GTAIV port appears to be in-development for current-gen consoles per his source.</p>
<p>He believes Max Payne 3 will follow after. <a href="https://t.co/jpKrpiK1Fo">pic.twitter.com/jpKrpiK1Fo</a></p>

<p>In the past, we have heard multiple times that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-iv-remastered-2023/">Grand Theft Auto IV would return to modern consoles</a>, but neither ports nor remasters have materialized, so we have to take what Tez2 revealed with a grain of salt. Given how Grand Theft Auto VI has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">delayed to May 2026</a>, however, Rockstar Games and Take-Two now have a window of opportunity to still give fans of the series something that could tide them over until the launch of the next entry in the franchise. Hopefully, this port will receive better treatment than the disappointing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition collection.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Cards will likely be widely used, as the cartridge formats available to developers and publishers are rather limited.</p>
<p>As reported by Necro Felipe on X, the recent leak from Arc System Works, which included an in-development build of Guilty Gear Stride and the reveal of a new unannounced game that will launch on the next-generation Nintendo system, confirmed that only three types of game formats are available - digital game only, 64 GB cartridge, and Game-Key Card format. As the only actual cartridge option is the 64GB one, this is likely why many of the games releasing during the system's launch window are doing so in Key Card format, and why the format will likely be widespread unless Nintendo starts offering more cartridge options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="pt">[Nintendo Switch 2]</p>
<p>Graças aos vazamentos da Arc System Works, encontrados apenas três tipos de formatos são exibidos para jogos em projeto para o Switch 2:</p>
<p>• [DL] Jogo digital apenas<br>
• [64GB] Cartucho com jogo completo<br>
• [POTION] Codinome para o formato Key Card</p>
<p>— 'Necro' Felipe #UnivNintendo (@necrolipe) <a href="https://twitter.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While new in name, the concept behind the Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards is nothing new, as we have seen a lot of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S retail editions discs that don't include games, and require substantial downloads to play games, like the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-retail-requires-full-download/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>. What makes this format interesting, other than the fact that they can be lent to other players as if they were a regular cartridge, is the fact that, judging from the Arc System Works leak, Game-Key cards will allow downloading of games even in regions that don't officially support the eShop.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

			<p>The creator of the amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project</a>, which was so good even in its first few versions that it was officially implemented in the next-gen version, released some stunning texture packs for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p>The first of these packs created by Halk Hogan PL is the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1614?tab=images" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ultra Quality 8K Body Textures - Imperials</a> pack, which comes in different resolution options, including 8K diffuse with the best quality, improves body details and quality, makes skin color more natural, and is more suitable for all Imperial characters. The results are excellent, as highlighted in the comparison screenshots on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1614?tab=images">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the description of the texture pack above found on Nexus Mods, the Ultra Quality 8K Body Textures pack is best used with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1284">Realistic High Quality Skin pack</a>, which improves human skin and makes it more realistic for all the races found in Oblivion Remastered, except for Argonians and Khajiits. This texture pack also slightly improves face details.</p>
<p>The third Oblivion Remastered texture pack shared by Halk Hogan PL is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2522?tab=description">Smooth Beautiful Faces pack</a>, which introduces impressive face textures that are a significant improvement over the vanilla textures. Among the improvements the new textures bring are more detailed lips, high-quality eyebrows, and more. Despite the new textures working best for female characters with the youngest possible age of the character creator, they still improve the faces of characters of all ages.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.
