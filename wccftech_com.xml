			<p>The long-rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is going to be shadowdropped in a few days, according to a very reliable insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on yesterday's episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GiantBomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giant Bomb</a>'s GameBreaking News, reliable insider Jeff Grubb, who correctly provided information before official announcements multiple times in the past, provided an update on the rumored remake of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, saying that it will be shadowdropped next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Prices Increasing in Some Regions | GameBreaking News 04/14/25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_ONk_GmF-Q?start=2238&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard that the Oblivion remake&nbsp;<span>will be released towards the end of April. Just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, another reliable insider, NateTheHate, suggested that the game would be released close to April 21st, so at this point, there's a very high chance one of the worst-kept</span>&nbsp;gaming secrets of the year will indeed be released in a week or so.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake, or rather remaster as it was called at the time, was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">2023</a> during an FTC investigational hearing with Xbox head Phil Spencer. The game, however, was never acknowledged in any official capacity, and its scope has likely changed since its unofficial reveal, as it is said it will be a full-blown remake powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a>, which will also include some gameplay changes besides improved visuals. Thankfully, it seems like it won't be long until we finally learn how the classic RPG will have been changed for its new release.</p>
