			<p>A new The First Berserker: Khazan update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing new features, balance, and system changes, and more.</p>
<p>The update, which will go live on PC and consoles later today, introduces AMD FSR 3 and AMD FSR 4 support on AMD Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs. The latest version of the upscaler can be enabled via driver settings with the Adrenalin driver version 25.6.1 or later installed, and will be in use even if the in-game interface says that AMD FSR 3 is instead.</p>
<p>Besides introducing AMD FSR 3 and 4 support on PC, the new The First Berserker: Khazan brings new free DLC for all users, including new armor sets and hairstyles to customize Khazan's appearance, balance adjustments, difficulty changes, augment gear tweaks, interface improvements, and more. The full update notes can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543361383085900258?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam.</a></p>
<p>Though far from being the most original game, I have found The First Berserker: Khazan to be one of the best soulslike games released recently. Combining features from the FromSoftware franchise with mechanics lifted from Team NINJA's games like Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, the game offers a fast-paced, intense experience that's extremely enjoyable to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">review.</a></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square back in 2003, and his departure impacted more than the popular role-playing game series, as Square reportedly "collapsed" after he left.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-collapsed-after-he-left-final-fantasy-composer-on-how-hironobu-sakaguchis-innate-leadership-skills-held-the-company-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Automaton</a>, the creator of the Final Fantasy series recently spoke on the NOBIYO To Isshoni podcast hosted by longtime series composer Nobuo Uematsu about their time together at the Japanese publisher. The creator of one of the most beloved JRPG series was the "big boss" even in the company's early days, and managed to work even at the beginning when Square was more like a club of university students rather than an actual company. At the time, Square did not have a proper corporate organization, Uematsu-san recalled during the show, but everybody listened to Sakaguchi-san, whom he described as a leader. As such, when Sakaguchi-san left Square, the situation was quite bad, and the entire organization suddenly collapsed, so much so that even Uematsu-san felt that he should leave, but the Final Fantasy series ultimately commends Square Enix for getting back on its feet after so many key figures in the company left right before the merger with the Dragon Quest series publisher.</p>
<p>Although Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square over 20 years ago, the legendary game developer recently collaborated with the publisher again on FANTASIAN: Neo Dimension, the PC and console port of the JRPG originally released on the Apple Arcade service a few years back. Sakaguchi-san's touch is unmistakable in the game, so much so that it feels like a proper entry in the Final Fantasy series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fantasian-neo-dimension-final-fantasy-in-all-but-name/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Credible reports from Bloomberg and The Verge earlier this week <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-is-reportedly-planning-another-major-xbox-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> another imminent big round of Xbox layoffs. These layoffs are supposed to be part of a wider Microsoft restructuring, and according to The Verge, some Xbox operations will actually cease in select regions.</p>
<p>Today, George Broussard, co-founder of Apogee Software (now 3D Realms) and one of the creators of Duke Nukem, <a href="https://x.com/georgebsocial/status/1938051752223232193" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> whispers from within the industry that the layoffs could remove as many as 2K employees. This would be around 10% of the workforce if we consider Activision and Bethesda as part of the Xbox teams, which is likely the case. The companies will most likely be affected anyway, as they were in the previous rounds of layoffs. Even more worrying is the rumor that studio closures could happen, too.</p>
<p>The first big round of cuts happened in January 2023, when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-slashing-10k-jobs-bethesda-the-coaltion-343-industries-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slashed</a> around ten thousand jobs, although that was across all its divisions and not just in gaming. The cuts involved Bethesda, The Coalition, and 343 Industries, among others. One year later, just a few months after the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> another 1900 employees between the Xbox and ABK teams, amounting to around 8% of its gaming workforce. That also caused the cancellation of Project Odyssey, a survival game in development at Activision based on a new fantasy IP.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a> Arkane Austin (the development team behind Prey and Redfall, Tango Gameworks (The Evil Within, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and Hi-Fi Rush), Alpha Dog Games (The Mighty Doom), and Roundhouse Studios. Thankfully, Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revived</a> a few months later by KRAFTON and brought with it the Hi-Fi Rush franchise.</p>
<p>With Microsoft's financial quarter set to end on June 30, the announcement isn't far off and may come by the end of this week. Stay tuned to get all the official details as they come.</p>
