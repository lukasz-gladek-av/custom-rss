			<p>Much to many people's surprise, Assassin's Creed Shadows is knocking it out of the park. While Monster Hunter Wilds was an incredibly big game, with it selling eight million copies in just a matter of days. On top of that, it reached 1.3 million concurrent players on Steam. However, Assassin's Creed Shadows is hot on the trails of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has already reached around<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/"> two million players</a> and is continuing to increase. Compared to Monster Hunter Wilds, Assassin's Creed takes the lead in physical copies sold in the UK. At present, Shadows is the biggest physical launch of the year in the country, as noted by <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1903885728821674283" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameIndustry.biz's Christopher Dring</a>.</p>
<p>This feudal Japan title saw it reach over one million players on launch day, despite the ongoing <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-damning-reports-of-abuse-by-assassins-creed-shadows-studio/">controversy</a> throughout the advertising period of the game. It was also delayed multiple times, but it seems that was for a good reason, as most audiences who have played the game seem to be happy with what they've gotten from it.</p>
<p>With Assassin's Creed Shadows reaching over two million players, it means that it has now bested the performance of Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, two of the newer titles that performed incredibly well for Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Dring also mentions that it has sold more boxed copies in one week than <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> did in three months, which is a bit of a harsh statistic for Ubisoft. However, for most, it won't come as a surprise, as even Ubisoft has acknowledged that Star Wars Outlaws did not perform in the way they wanted. In some aspects, Assassin's Creed Shadows was their final hope to produce something in recent years that had the chance to be majorly successful, as Assassin's Creed Mirage didn't quite hit the mark for some players, either.</p>
<p>However, there are still plans for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-is-reportedly-getting-its-first-dlc/"> first DLC</a> to be released for Assassin's Creed Mirage, with ongoing support and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-gets-a-free-dlss-3-mod-thanks-to-lukefz/">mods</a> being released for the title.</p>
<p>While the game holds this very impressive information at the moment, it is likely that it will have it snatched from them by releases such as Call of Duty, Mario Kart 9, or Grand Theft Auto VI, should it be released this year.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about this game, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Francesco De Meo's review</a> of the title, where he gave it a generous score of 8.7, calling it a "gorgeous dive into feudal chaos."</p>

			<p>Multiple Xbox games will hit the Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation 5 consoles this year besides those that have already been announced, according to a new report shared online today.</p>
<p>Commenting on the release date announcement for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-out-on-april-17-for-ps5/">PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">stated</a> that 2025 will include a lot more titles appearing on PlayStation 5 and the next-generation Nintendo console. Which former Xbox console exclusives will make the jump has yet to be seen, but it wouldn't be surprising to see any of these games make an appearance during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has yet to reveal which games will hit rival formats next, there's a very good chance that Starfield will be among the next to release at least on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-release-imminent/">Earlier this month</a>, the console's logo appeared on Creation listings, suggesting that the game's announcement and release could be imminent.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Fable series could be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">multiplatform release</a> right from launch, as work on other console versions of the game has reportedly already begun. With the game having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/">delayed</a> to 2026, a multiplatform launch has become even more likely, although it remains to be seen how the Nintendo Switch 2 will be able to handle the game, given its lower specs compared to the other current-generation systems.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, leaker billbil-kun said the release date announcement for the PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would take place today. Indeed, a few minutes ago, publisher Bethesda Softworks revealed that the acclaimed first-person adventure/action game released in December by MachineGames will debut on Sony's console in less than a month, on April 17.</p>
<p>Digital pre-orders are <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/?country-selector=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now open</a>, and physical pre-orders, depending on your region, are expected to be available soon. Users can choose from three options: the Standard Edition, available both digitally and physically; the Premium Edition, also available in both formats; and the retail-only Collector's Bundle.</p>
<p>All pre-orders will reward players with The Last Crusade Pack, which includes the Traveling Suit Outfit and the Lion Tamer Whip in-game items. The pricier Premium Edition also adds a Temple of Doom Outfit, a digital artbook, and access to the story DLC The Order of Giants, which has been confirmed to launch in 2025. The Premium Edition, just like the Collector's Edition, also provides two days of early access, allowing Indiana Jones fans to start playing on April 15.</p>

<p>The $199 Collector's bundle adds the following physical items to everything mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>An 11” Great Circle globe with a puzzle mechanic that unlocks a hidden storage compartment when solved</li>
<li>Allmaker Relic replica</li>
<li>Adventure Journal</li>
<li>Jumbo SteelBook display case</li>
</ul>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has been 'visually optimized' for the PS5 Pro, said Bethesda without going into further details. That info will likely be shared in the few remaining weeks ahead of the launch. By the way, the developers are also adding new whip abilities to the game, regardless of the platform you play on, with an upcoming free update. With “Open Season”, whip-cracking an enemy will temporarily cause them to take more damage from subsequent attacks, while when using “Sleight of Hand,” players can disarm an enemy and cause their weapon to fly Indy's way.</p>

<p>I found Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to be fantastic, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my review (9/10)</a> on PC:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
