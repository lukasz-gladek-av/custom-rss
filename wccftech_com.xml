			<p>Today, HoYoVerse (previously known as miHoYo) has announced a new creature collector strategy game titled Honkai: Nexus Anima. As you can guess from its title, it is set in the same universe as <a href="https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-version-2-6-update-launches-october-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, the free-to-play gacha RPG launched in 2023.</p>



<p>This game will play very differently, though, as you can see in the footage embedded below. Here's the official description provided by the development team: </p>



<p><em>In the game, players take on the role of a plane-hopping traveler who has escaped captivity, embarking on an all-new adventure. The journey begins in a tranquil town that opens into uncharted realms. As players advance, they encounter Anima companions with distinct personalities and forge bonds that carry through both exploration and combat. In Nexus Battles, these companions stand beside players as the story uncovers the mysteries of the protagonist’s past. As the latest major entry in the Honkai series, Honkai: Nexus Anima continues to deliver the franchise’s signature high-quality storytelling and artistic style, and it also marks a bold new chapter in both gameplay and worldbuilding.</em></p>

<p>HoYoVerse is currently recruiting for a 'Nexus Bond' test that will be available via PC and iOS devices, with the studio sharing these recommended PC specs: Intel i5 (11th Gen)/AMD Ryzen 5 5000 series or higher CPU, a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060/AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT or higher graphics card, and 16GB RAM. Windows 10 64-bit or higher and 15GB of space are also required. For iOS, you will need an iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, or any later model (excluding iPhone 13 and 13 mini). The app requires iOS 14.0 or above, 6GB of device RAM, and 10GB of space.</p>



<p>Signups are open <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> through Friday, September 12. Honkai: Nexus Anima is definitely one game to watch, especially after the enormous success of Genshin Impact and, to a lesser extent, Zenless Zone Zero.</p>

			<p>Dying Light: The Beast is due out in a little less than a month from the time of this writing, as it'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on September 19, 2025. As part of the road to launch, developer Techland has debuted a new trailer, and more interestingly, shown off some behind-the-scenes concept art, and gone into detail about the team's design intentions with multiple elements of the game in a <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-they-tried-to-break-him">new developer blog</a>.</p>



<p>Techland delves into Kyle Crane's return, and the artistic direction behind what he looks like now after a decade of imprisonment, and how to tell the story of his time in captivity without the player being able to constantly look at his face in what Techland refers to as an FPP game (first-person parkour). Kyle's arms, then, were given great focus.</p>

<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Part 1: Torture &amp; Suffering" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mB56AIZV3Hw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>In an FPP game, it’s difficult to convey the appearance of a character, since one of the few elements visible are the hero’s hands. That’s why we put a lot of effort into the details here. A special shoutout to Charidimos Bitsakakis, who, accompanied by other artists, spent countless hours perfecting them. We recreated Kyle’s hands from the first game, but added scars and other marks reflecting the torture he endured in the Baron’s lab. The experiments also gave rise to the Beast Mode, which we wanted to be visible in FPP as well - we looked for a visual language to represent his transformation and decided on black veins, dark and menacing, perfectly reflecting Kyle’s nature and what he sees when he becomes the Beast.</em>"</p>

<p>The blog also digs into the ways Techland looked to evolve gameplay in Dying Light: The Beast through tweaking and adjusting Kyle's animations, that they should both "<em>be inspired by DL1 Kyle - reflecting his muscle memory, personality, and fighting style</em>," and have "<em>a clear contrast between Kyle in the beast mode - brutal, uncontrolled, overconfident - and Kyle outside of it - pragmatic, precise, and confident</em>."</p>



<p>It's alltogether great dive into Kyle Crane and Dying Light: The Beast for fans who are eagerly anticipating the game's release next month.</p>



<p>When Wccftech checked out Dying Light: The Beast in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/">a preview earlier this year</a>, Kai Tatsumoto found that Crane had indeed been turned into a beast, saying it was the one "<em>certain</em>" thing about the game, even after only checking out an early portion.</p>

			<p>Today, Sucker Punch Productions announced <a href="https://x.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1961111668345241612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> that their upcoming game Ghost of Yōtei has officially gone gold. This means the game is fully completed and has been sent to be mastered for physical copies, although of course, these days a studio's work is never done. Sucker Punch will still likely continue up to the last minute for the day-one patch, and even beyond that. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">know</a> that Ghost of Yōtei, like its predecessor, will receive a 'Legends' multiplayer mode in 2026, free for all owners of the game.</p>



<p>A spiritual successor to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima, the new game is however set in a different place, at a different time, and with a different protagonist. In this one, players will step into the role of Atsu, who at the beginning of the game is nearly killed alongside her family by the so-called Yōtei Six, led by the renegade samurai Lord Saitō and consisting of the Snake, the Oni, the Kitsune, the Spider, and the Dragon. Sixteen years later, Atsu roams the surroundings of the titular Mount Yōtei to exact bloody vengeance on the aforementioned group.</p>



<p>New features compared to Ghost of Tsushima include dynamic weather effects, such as snow, rain, and auroras, inspired by the real-life environment surrounding Mount Yōtei. Additionally, Sucker Punch has <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's flexible, nonlinear quest structure allows players to choose the order in which they confront the Yōtei Six, fostering emergent narrative paths and player-driven momentum. Similar to the first game, players can take on side missions, such as hunting outlaws for bounty rewards. Several side activities also return, including bathing in an onsen and cutting bamboo, as well as new activities such as sumi-e painting and setting up a campsite where Atsu can cook and play her shamisen.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game length</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-a-similar-sized-map-to-tsushima-but-it-has-been-designed-to-feel-larger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">map size</a> are said to be similar to the previous entry, though the developers also said that the game world will feel larger, owing to the real environments. Ghost of Yōtei will be released on October 2 for PlayStation 5, with a PC version practically assured to follow in about a year or so, given Sony's recent policy.</p>
