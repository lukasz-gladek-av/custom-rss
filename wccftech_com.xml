			<p>Here at Wccftech, we have followed the long development of the Skyblivion project for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over eight years</a>. For nearly a decade, an ambitious team of modders has strived to recreate The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Ever since early 2023, we have known that the team was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting 2025</a> as their tentative release window for the total conversion mod. Later that year, though, the infamous FTC vs. Microsoft trial leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda had plans to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 one, interestingly).</p>
<p>I was already in touch with Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-remix-qa-with-skyblivion-lead-dev-hopes-dreams-and-worries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having interviewed him</a> in late 2022 about the modding and remastering potential of NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform. Needless to say, I immediately reached out again to gauge his reaction to that leak. Back then, though, he didn't really buy that it was true. I pointed out those were official documents, so the project might have been canceled or delayed, but it was surely in existence at some point.</p>
<p>For a while, it&nbsp;<span>seemed like the Oblivion remaster might have been canceled. Throughout 2024, there were no further leaks or rumors. Everything changed in 2025, though, as the first concrete leaks appeared,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a>&nbsp;that Virtuos had worked on it using Unreal Engine 5. Over the last few weeks, insiders have begun&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a> that Microsoft could be planning a shadow drop—a game announcement and release at the same time—</span>at some point in April.</p>
<p>At last, visual evidence of Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">materialized yesterday</a> when fellow Internet sleuths found the game's first screenshots on the developer's website. Just a couple of hours later, Skyblivion lead Rebelzize <a href="https://x.com/rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140?s=46&amp;t=iYm9jOtB1G3D9hHCMqQ8dw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared a brief comment on X</a>, having dealt with the fact that it was all real:</p>
<p><em>The real remake is the friends we made along the way.</em></p>
<p><em><span>To be clear, this changes nothing for me. This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year.</span><span> All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster.</span></em></p>
<p><iframe title="SKYBLIVION Live Development Stream[LIKING THE STREAM IS APPRECIATED]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-ZsA-zHUJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Later yesterday, I spoke briefly with him to get an expanded reaction:</p>
<p><em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different than what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real its good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>For what it's worth, I think there's definitely space for both Skyblivion and Oblivion Remastered. The former might not be as visually impressive (although I'm sure at least some of the new Skyrim graphics features can be ported to it), but it will feature both cut content and new content, as well as other gameplay changes. From what we know of the official remaster based on the leaks, there should be some gameplay changes to make it more modern, but no restored or new content. As Rebelzize put it, users can choose between two versions of Oblivion, and that can only be a good thing. By the way, I've also asked him whether the plan is still to launch in 2025, and the answer was yes.</p>

			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Jagex <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-is-a-co-op-open-world-survival-crafting-game-due-soon-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, an open world survival crafting game set in its beloved fantasy universe. The UK developer said back then that the Steam Early Access launch would launch sometime in Spring but did not provide a specific date. It was, therefore, surprising to see the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become available without any further announcements on Valve's store</a> a few hours ago, priced at £24.99 GBP / $29.99 / €29.99.</p>
<p>Jesse America, Executive Producer of this game, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We’re so excited to surprise players with our Early Access launch today and invite them to discover the magical world of RuneScape: Dragonwilds right now. We’ve been working hard to develop an entirely new type of RuneScape experience that ignites fans’ passion, creativity and love for questing, and provide them with an all-new RuneScape adventure to discover. And this is just the start of our development journey. Throughout Early Access, we’ll be updating the game regularly with new content and features, while listening closely to the community to deliver an iconic open world survival crafting game that is loved equally by our biggest RuneScape fans and new players alike. Our community is at the heart of everything we do at Jagex and we look forward to seeing how they shape RuneScape: Dragonwilds throughout our Early Access journey.</em></p>

<p>So far, early user reception seems quite positive. The average user review score is 79% for the time being. Jagex also outlined the Early Access roadmap. There will be constant improvements to the following areas: combat, performance, multiplayer, difficulty, lighting, weather, messaging, and tutorials. New magic, ranged, and farming skills will be introduced, as well as new quests, gear, lore, music, animals, and a new enemy type, the lesser dragons. Moreover, the base building mechanics will be expanded, and the Hardcore and Creative modes will be added. Last but not least, a whole new region called Fellhollow will be introduced.</p>
<p>This zone is said to be suspended between life and death. A twisted dragon called Imaru is its overlord, and various undead enemies will populate Fellhollow. Players will be guided here by Death, a well-known character to RuneScape fans.</p>

			<p>As we get closer to the game's launch date, publisher 505 Games and developer MercurySteam are posting regular new Blades of Fire trailers focused on different areas of the single player action/adventure title. The latest one dives into combat, which is a major part of the game.</p>
<p><em>Weapons are split into three categories: slashing, piercing, and blunt types, with some weapons having the option of swapping between both slashing and piercing. To ensure you're using the</em><br>
<em>right weapon for the job, check the enemy's outline for their weak points and cycle through your equipped weapons. Fighting with the right weapon and targeting an enemy's weak points ensures that you'll make quick work of all those you come up against.</em></p>
<p><em>Make use of the terrain by sticking to the higher ground to gain the advantage in battle. Adso is also here to assist. He will analyze and document every enemy you encounter, recording all the details in his chronicle. The more you face each enemy type, the more detailed Adso's notes will become, revealing their lore and better strategies to defeat them. Defeating a certain number of enemies wielding the same weapon will unlock that weapon's forging scroll. Once the scroll is collected, the new weapon will be ready for you to forge, thus further improving your arsenal.</em></p>

<p>At GDC 2025, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with Blades of Fire</a> and came away with a positive first impression of the game:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies.</em></p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X starting May 22. You can read the full system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

			<p>More than 100 notes to collect and read in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> are scattered throughout its 14 chapters. That might seem like a lot, but if you follow this and every other chapter guide I've posted so far, you'll see how it's straightforward to pick each one up along the way as you play through the game.</p>
<p>And you'll want to grab them all because South of Midnight's storytelling, including these written notes, is by far the strongest part of the game.</p>
<p>There are another 10 notes to collect in Chapter 6. Here's where to find them all.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Chapter 6 doesn't give you much of a break compared to Chapter 5, as this chapter has 10, instead of 11, notes to pick up. As you'll see below, at least a few of them are clumped together.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Keep Out Sign Materials</strong> - A little ways into the chapter, after using an echo of a crashed boat to jump across a river; you'll find the first note of the chapter on a box to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Abernathy's Lament</strong> - You'll find this note on the second level of the barn you go through to find the hole for Crouton to enter and get rid of the Stigma Knot blocking your path. To get there, you'll need to enter through the roof, which you can do by heading back the way you came through the barn, where an echo of a wagon is sitting and waiting to your left, behind a couple of trees trapped together with vines. Use the wagon to jump onto the roof of the barn, and through a hole in the roof you'll reach the second level which contains a health filament and the note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burn After Reading</strong> - Once you see Bunny's cottage, before you walk through the gates you'll see a path to your left that leads to a combat encounter. Once you've cleared it, as you head back to Bunny's cottage you'll find this note resting on a box between two rocks to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Correction Requested</strong> - After walking through the gates to Bunny's cottage, walk around to the back of the cottage to find a large tree in her backyard and a small cabin to the right of the tree. Walk past the cabin and you'll see some sunflowers next to crates of honey, with the note resting on a honey crate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on the Rogarou</strong> - You won't find this note, or the next three, until after completing the three combat encounters to get into Bunny's cottage. Thankfully, this note and the next three are all inside the cottage, so you're clearing through a bunch quickly. This first one is on a table in the room to your right once you walk in the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bunny's Journal - On Weavers</strong> - This note is in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's left bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on Dreams and Fog</strong> - This note is also in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's right bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Missing Children List</strong> - You'll find this note in the secret room behind the bookshelf in Bunny's bedroom, on a desk towards the back of the secret room, to the left of where you'll see Huggin' Molly's red yarn.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrowers Hate a Liar</strong> - After the cutscene with Bunny, and once you're in your new duds, follow the path away from the cottage and beyond a few exploding mushrooms. You'll find this note in a dead tree on the right side of the path.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Huggin' Molly Sightings</strong> - After speaking to Catfish, follow the path beyond some more exploding mushrooms to the point where you'll see two paths. One that leads you to the tree Catfish was talking about by using your grapple, and the other to your left with the echo of a bridge. Take the left path to find another combat encounter, and once you've cleared it, you'll find this note on a box to your right as you exit the combat arena.</p>
<p>And that's all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 6. You should have 38 out of 103 by now. Only 65 more to go.</p>

			<p>Strong as<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/"> South of Midnight's</a> story is, reading every note along the way really does add to the storytelling in a special way. Which is why you'll want to read them all, even if you're just trying to find them for the achievement.</p>
<p>These guides will tell you where to find every note in the game, all 103 of them, across South of Midnight's 14 chapters.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 5</h2>
<p>If you've been following along with the rest of these guides, then you'll recognize that Chapter 5 has more notes than any level so far. Here's where to grab all 11 of Chapter 5's notes.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's Pieces of the Self—</strong>The first note of the chapter is found right after you've found Crouton, in the hollow tree immediately next to where you'll send Crouton to do away with the stigma.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Statue Flyer</strong> - After continuing further into the level, and completing the first combat encounter (which will also show you the first memory), you'll find this note on a broken fence post, just below the giant Auntie Belle's sign and statue.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Iron</strong> - You'll find this note just in front of Jolene's church, after the cutscene with Ms. Pearle and Jolene. It will be on top of a box that's next to the fence, which will be immediately to your right once the cutscene ends.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hollow Dreamers</strong> - After grabbing the last note, follow the path the strands layout for you across the water towards a house that's covered in vines. The note will be on a couch that sits on the porch of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Kids Need a Hand</strong> - After fighting your first Slug Haint (the big round enemy that digs underground) and seeing the second memory for the chapter, you'll find this note inside the house that'll be right in front of you, and on the table to your left when you walk through the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Jo's Penance</strong> - Before leaving the house, walk up the stairs to the second floor, and head to the room at the end of the hall, which will also be the only room left open for you to walk into. You'll find this note on a desk with a guitar leaning against it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yard Sale Notice</strong> - This note is a little further into the level, and you won't be able to get to it until you've reached Swopes Farm. To reach it, you'll first have to use an echo box to climb a high tower where you'll find a Floof knot. From this vantage, you'll also be able to see over a tall stack of hay bales. Jump over the hay bales to the other side, and turn left towards a trailer, then right towards a small cabin. You'll find this note resting on a folding chair.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Honor thy Father and Mother</strong> - Once you're back to where you climbed the high tower, head towards the big house on your right. The door will open when you get close, and you'll find this note in what looks like the family room immediately to your right when you walk in.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bashful Farmhand in the Setting Sun</strong> - Before leaving the house, head up to the second floor, where you'll find a Floof knot in one room, and this note on a desk next to a typewriter in the other.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Pigs are a Loss</strong> - When you make it to the Pig Factory, inside the factory you'll enter a room with a Floof knot on top of a container to your left. The note, on the other hand, is on ground level, sitting on a table immediately to the right of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sutter's Will and Testament</strong> - After the Two-Toed Tom boss fight, and after you've been swallowed up by the giant gator, you'll find this note once you've made it to the other side of the pool the squealing pig from earlier is swimming in. It's on the wooden floor, next to a lamp.</p>
<p>That's all 11 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 5. If you've been following along with these guides, then you'll have acquired 28 out of 103 now. Only 75 more to go.</p>
