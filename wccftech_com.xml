			<p>The first thing you notice about Compulsion Games' latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, might be its striking visuals, but its strongest aspect is its excellent storytelling.</p>
<p>That includes the writing and performances in the cutscenes and the notes you can discover that add more context to the story. That's why, beyond just doing it for the achievement, it is worth your time to try and find all of the 103 notes there are to find across the 14 chapters of South of Midnight's story.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find the 4 notes hiding in Chapter 8.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 8</h2>
<p>After having to look out for 15 notes in Chapter 7, you'll be happy to know that Chapter 8 is a much easier time with only 4 notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Their Eyes Were Watching -&nbsp;</strong>You'll be able to find this note right at the beginning of the level, immediately after using a wind tunnel for the first time. When you land, it'll be waiting on a tree stump to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346-Weird Happenings -</strong> After using a wind tunnel for the second time in the level, head left when you land to find a Floof knot and this note lying on the ground.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346- Red Yarn</strong> - After finding the previous note, you'll have to clear some branches away to wall-run over a gap. When you reach the other side, on the right side of the path, you'll find some sunflowers with a tree stump next to them, where you'll find this note waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta 346 - Search Called Off</strong> - You'll find this note just after the first combat encounter of the level. Use the grapple hook to cross the gap after completing the encounter, and before heading into the cave blocked by wood and red yarn, this note will be on the ground on the right side of the path.</p>
<p>And that's where to find all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 8. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll have found 57 notes by now. Only 46 more to find.</p>

			<p>Finally, after weeks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-april-release/">leaks</a> and even official <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">screenshots appearing online</a>, Bethesda has not only officially acknowledged The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remake but also announced that we'll get a full reveal and showcase of the game tomorrow, <strong>April 22, 2025</strong>, at <strong>8 am PT / 11 am ET / 4 pm BT.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>A short <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">post</a> from the studio's official X account tells us when we'll learn more about the long-awaited remake and where to check it out, with the 'where' being either the Bethesda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> channels.</p>
<p>The title of the video on Bethesda's YouTube channel says "<em>All will be revealed...,</em>" hopefully implying that we'll not only learn about what has gone into the remake, the new features available, and the release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="All will be revealed...." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release date could very well be tomorrow, shortly after the reveal. Rumors about the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remake already had their sights set on today, or at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">sometime</a> in the back half of April, for the game's release.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we know that those rumors claiming an April 21 release had their wires crossed with today's announcement that the reveal would be tomorrow. But now we can expect to play Oblivion on at least Xbox consoles and PCs before the week is out. It's still up in the air whether it'll be available on PS5 right away or if Xbox players will enjoy a short period of exclusivity for the remake before it comes to PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/renting-a-ps5-is-increasingly-popular-in-japan-with-retailers-selling-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While people are still buying plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/">PS5 consoles</a>, renting a PS5 is becoming an increasingly popular option for players in Japan. A new report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2504/20/news070_4.html">IT Media News</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/renting-ps5s-proving-extremely-popular-in-japan-with-most-stores-selling-out/">VGC</a>) shows that retail stores in Japan where you can rent a PS5 are selling out of consoles to rent.</p>
<p>You can rent a PS5 in multiple regions worldwide, with the cost of renting a PS5 for either 8 days or 15 days at a time in Japan coming in at ¥980 ($6.62 USD) or ¥1,780 ($12.02 USD), respectively. The service only became available in Japan at the top of the year as a response to the console not being as readily available in the region.</p>
<p>A Japanese retailer, GEO, told IT Media news that the service is "<em>more popular than they expected</em>" and that the majority of its 400 stores are "<em>at capacity</em>" with the consoles available to rent. GEO cites the release of Monster Hunter Wilds as a likely reason why the service has, of late, become extremely popular.</p>
<p>Considering the cost, it's a very low barrier to entry if all you want to do is try a console and a new game before making a bigger investment to buy the whole console and a brand-new game. Other retailers around the world, like Raylo in the UK, allow players to rent a PS5 for much longer periods of time. With the popularity of the service in Japan, it wouldn't be surprising if longer rental periods start to be introduced.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that buying a PS5 to own has only gone up in price since it launched in 2020, rather than down, as the case has been in every previous console generation. If you are someone who wants a PS5 but has been unable to buy one for the last five years, it's no surprise that you would jump at the chance to take one home for a couple of weeks for about $12 instead of buying it for hundreds.</p>
<p>At least then you'd be able to satisfy your curiosity to some degree. It'll also be interesting to see if Sony responds by focusing on making more consoles available in Japan.</p>
