			<p>During a new episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzAtYaSYZms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wicked Inside</a>, Moon Studios revealed major news about its in-development action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-update-revamps-crucible-improves-combat-and-adds-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Rest for the Wicked</a>. Arguably the most important tidbit is that the Austrian developer has secured the game's publishing rights back from Private Division, after several months of legal negotiations. This will allow the studio to be fully independent when making decisions about the title. To celebrate the occurrence, there's a 30% discount valid for another 32 hours or so.</p>
<p>Moon Studios then moved on to share details about the next big update, The Breach, out on April 30. This update will expand the campaign and introduce new areas, armors, factions, enemies, and weapons, roughly doubling the world size. The new areas include the Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, while players will encounter new foes known as the Harvesters and the Balak Taw.</p>
<p>The Breach will add new weapon archetypes (gauntlets &amp; wands) to No Rest for the Wicked and an updated loot system for more build variety. Furthermore, the game world is getting more dynamic thanks to the 'Alive' system, where factions and enemies dynamically reshape it. The Plague system will also unleashe powerful new plague enemies and bosses. Plague outbreaks now occur throughout Sacra, and players can cleanse these regions to gain powerful new plague resources.</p>
<p>Several quality-of-life improvements are also included, such as the ability to teleport directly to your home, improved item stacking, new fast travel options, refined enchantments, timer improvements, and a redesigned storage system. Additionally, there's now a Hardcore mode, and visual and performance have been enhanced and optimized with improved lighting and NVIDIA DLSS implementation.</p>

<p>After The Breach, the following big update will introduce multiplayer for up to four players. A preview of that is coming soon. The developer is also planning further expansions to the city, housing, farming, and progression systems, as well as further refinements to combat. Lastly, the celebrated composer of the Ori series, Gareth Coker, has rejoined Moon Studios and will contribute new music to No Rest for the Wicked.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Francesco De Meo's early access hands-on preview</a>, the game has a lot of potential, although the developers clearly still need some time to realize it. The full game has no release date yet.</p>
