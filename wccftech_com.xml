			<p>Sandfall Interactive's debut game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, is undoubtedly one of the defining games for 2025. Not only is it one of the most beloved titles of the year and the heavy favourite to win Game of the Year at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> this evening (<a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">especially after it swept the Golden Joysticks</a>), it's one of the greatest success stories this year of an independent team made up of former Ubisoft developers coming together to prove, at least to themselves, that they could make the game they wanted to make, and that it would resonate with players.</p>



<p>Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html?searchResultPosition=1">The New York Times</a> (spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3m7ps6x4vgk2h">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>) reveals that's not all the studio wanted to prove. According to the report, not only did Sandfall Interactive keep the cost of Clair Obscur's development under $10 million, but it did so to prove that it didn't need to spend a crazy amount of money on a game to make something incredible.</p>



<p>"<em>Sandfall wanted to prove that indie studios were capable of making prestige games at a fraction of the budget and personnel of larger studios</em>," the report reads.</p>







<p>Now, you're probably thinking that there have been countless indies before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that proved you could make a top-tier game at a fraction of the budget that major publishers like Activision pour into Call of Duty every year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">and still they can't seem to get it right</a>.</p>



<p>Several games in the last two years alone proved you don't need to spend a ton of money to make something that captivates the entire industry, see Hollow Knight Silksong, Animal Well, Blue Prince, Hades 2, etc. But those games, and many like them, don't include big-name voice actors behind their characters, let alone big-name Hollywood actors. They don't include the kind of cinematic triumphs included in Clair Obscur, and they don't reach the level of triple-A polish that we're more accustomed to seeing from the likes of Rockstar, Sucker Punch, Naughty Dog, Activision, Obsidian, and more.</p>



<p>It is incredibly impressive that Sandfall was able to accomplish what it did with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and it feels more than deserving of the accolades it has been given since it launched earlier this year. Tonight, it has the chance to add to its list of accolades, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">with its record-setting 12 nominations at The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>



<p>When Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched in April this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo gave it a 9.5/10 in his review, writing</a>, "<em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em>"</p>

			<p>Today might be all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, but it's still another Thursday in a new week, which means another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday is here, with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-monster-hunter-stories/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud streaming service</a>. This week, seven titles enter the service for the first time, including two games from one franchise, and three games are added to the selection of titles that are RTX 5080-ready.</p>



<p>The two games from one franchise are Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection arriving on March 13, 2026</a>, you'll now be able to play through the first two games using GeForce NOW.</p>



<p>Two other notable games joining the service this week are two new releases, Skate Story and Death Howl, both two of the more interesting indie games to arrive towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining GeForce NOW for the first time this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skate Story (December 8)</li>



<li>Dome Keeper (December 9)</li>



<li>Death Howl (December 9)</li>



<li>RuneQuest: Warlords (December 9)</li>



<li>Everdream Village (December 12)</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as the three games that are now RTX 5080-ready, it's a good week for 4X strategy players and city-sim building players, with the three games being Age of Wonders 4, Cities: Skylines, and Cities: Skylines 2.</p>



<p>Speaking of the RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-adds-8-games-rtx-5080-servers-soon-to-be-live-worldwide/">they are still one region short of being available worldwide, according to the map of their initial rollout</a>. Stockholm has yet to be added, though it is expected to join the rest of the regions where RTX 5080 servers are already available "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, a final mention for The Game Awards, you can play a majority of the nominated games through GeForce NOW, including the heavyweight favourite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and the games that have a shot at stealing GOTY out from its grasp, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>
