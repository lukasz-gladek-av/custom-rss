			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle on PlayStation 5 Pro features Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and other improvements over other console versions while running at a consistent native 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> takes a good look at the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game developed by MachineGames, providing additional information on both. On base PlayStation 5, the game runs in its single display mode with dynamic resolution scaling ranging between 1800p and 1620p, with drops to 1440p. On PlayStation 5 Pro, on the other hand, the game is generally displayed at native 4K resolution, as confirmed<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-runs-native-4k-playstation-5-pro/"> last week</a>. The PS5 Pro version also features improvements to Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and Contact Shadows, although the improvements aren't huge. In addition, both versions of the game are extremely well optimized, as were the Xbox Series X and S versions, maintaining consistent 60 FPS with ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>It's good news that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks and runs well on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, as it is a game worth experiencing.

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle later this week, on April 17th, on PlayStation 5. The game is also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-has-10-year-plan-for-diablo-iv/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo IV</a> was released in 2023, it was the first new mainline entry in the series in more than a decade, and according to the Diablo series general manager Rod Fergusson, we'll be playing Diablo IV for just as long before we can start to expect Diablo V.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/chain-interview-marc-merrill-rod-fergusson-shuhei-yoshida-more">Game File</a>, Fergusson said that Blizzard is with Diablo IV "<em>for the long haul" and that the studio's plans for the game span</em> the next decade. So, don't expect to hear anything about Diablo V until approximately 2033.</p>
<p>"<em>We're here for the long haul,</em>" Fergusson said. "<em>We've been doing long-range planning recently. And I've created a roadmap - a 10-year roadmap...it was actually a 12-year [roadmap] - I can see this, this, this and this and all these different things that we can do, [which] is really inspiring. And it's really exciting. We're focused on what players want...I can't tell you much more than that."</em></p>
<p>The shortest time between Diablo releases was the four years between the first and second games. After that, it was 12 years before Diablo III came around and another 11 years between Diablo III and Diablo IV. So telling players to expect another 10-year gap between series installments is nothing new, and it would be on the shorter side if Diablo V released precisely 10 years after Diablo IV.</p>
<p>As far as short-term plans go, Blizzard announced the<a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/"> 2025 roadmap for Diablo IV</a> less than a week ago at the time of writing, confirming that a new major expansion for Diablo IV won't arrive until sometime in 2026 and that in the meantime, the significant updates in 2025 will come in the form of seasonal changes and quality of life updates players are still waiting for, such as being able to use keyboard and mouse controls on a console, which won't arrive until sometime this summer, according to the current schedule.</p>

			<p>The rumored portable edition of the PlayStation 6 won't be as powerful as the PlayStation 5, according to information shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking last month on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-3#post-270213490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoGAF forums</a>, as reported today on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywrgn/kepler_says_the_portable_ps6_is_a_15w_soc_on_3nm/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 revealed that the portable edition of the next-generation console by Sony won't be as powerful as the PlayStation 5, as it will be powered by a 15W SoC on 3nm. As the system is said to be able to run PS5 games, it will definitely be interesting to see how the portable system will be able to do so and which compromises will have to be made to achieve this.</p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the PlayStation 6 as of now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-soc-design-complete/">Earlier this year</a>, we heard again from Kepler L2 that the SoC is design complete and entered pre-silicon validation with A0 tapeout scheduled for later this year. While this doesn't tell us much about the console, the usual timeframe from A0 tapeout and release is 2 years, so there's a chance the system will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>The only thing we know for certain about the PlayStation 6 is that it will once again be powered by AMD. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">Last year</a>, it was confirmed that Intel also bid to produce the console, but ultimately AMD won due to a dispute at Intel over how much profit the company would make from each chip sold to Sony, which prevented the company from deciding on a price.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-won%E2%80%99t-be-a-%E2%80%9Cfull-priced%E2%80%9D-game-according-to-bungie.1163676/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie unveiled its new team-based extraction shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">Marathon</a> over the weekend, giving us our first honest look at the gameplay and a release date to look forward to. However, we did not get any idea about how much it would cost.</p>
<p>We've known for some time now that Marathon will not be a free-to-play title. The current rumor is that it will be priced at the same level Concord was, at $40. After the weekend showcase went live, previews for Marathon from the press who attended a recent in-person event where they got to play the game and speak to members of Marathon's team at Bungie also went live. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's</a> preview seems to shed more light on how Marathon will be priced.</p>
<p>Bungie told GameSpot that Marathon will be a "<em>premium</em>" release. Though they did not provide a specific number or price range, Bungie did confirm that it would not be a "<em>full-priced</em> <em>title.</em>"</p>
<p>That might be clear as mud, but it at least officially confirms what was already rumored: Marathon will not be aiming for that $70 premium price tag that most triple-A games get. This keeps the $40 price point still firmly in the lead as to what the price of the game might actually be.</p>
<p>With that said, there's a good chance it could be even less than $40 because the significant remaining variable is how Sony will approach Marathon after watching Concord fail in such a big way last year. The two games aren't entirely comparable. Concord was made by a studio with nowhere near Bungie's legacy. Concord was entirely a brand-new series, unlike Marathon, which has an existing fan base that would be interested in trying this reboot of the series.</p>
<p>There's also likely a contingent of Bungie die-hard fans who will buy Marathon just to try the latest game from their favorite studio. Those factors alone make it very unlikely that Marathon crashes in the same way Concord did.</p>
<p>Still, it wouldn't be surprising if Sony chose to hedge its bets by making the barrier to entry for Marathon cheaper than it was for Concord. Pricing won't be the only factor in Marathon's success or lack thereof, but it will still play a big role. Hopefully, we'll have a better idea of the price soon.</p>
