			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 leaked clock speeds, which look rather legitimate, further suggest how the system is powered by an 8nm chip, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> leaked clock speeds</a> of the new system, highlighting how they look reasonable enough for the type of system the Nintendo Switch 2 will be, although with some caveats, such as the handheld GPU clock speed looking a little low for the type of cooling the system has, and the CPU clock speeds, which are not particularly low for an 8nm CPU sporting eight Cortex A78 cores, being higher in portable mode than docked. The latter is particularly interesting, as it suggests there is still something we do not know about how the system works in this case, as it might disable cores in portable modes to save battery, or could have different CPU frequency modes in docked mode. Still, everything considered, these clock speeds are definitely in line with what an 8nm chip can achieve, further suggesting that it is the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the system. Speaking about the specs, one point of concern could be the low memory bandwidth in portable mode, especially if the system uses a 1080p screen as rumored. The reveal trailer, unfortunately, did not specify if the screen sports a higher resolution than the one of the original system.</p>
<p>What the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer also failed to show is how the system will take advantage of the T239's Ampere architecture. The short Mario Kart footage was not at a very high resolution, and it looked aliased as the vast majority of Nintendo games, and in no part, it showed evidence of using NVIDIA DLSS or any other advanced feature that the architecture can deliver. Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS, Digital Foundry rightly highlights during the podcast how the Nintendo Switch 2 could be able to use the new Transformer Model, but its viability remains a question, considering the new model is computationally heavier than the current CNN model and wasn't developed for a mobile system that's essentially a few generations old at this point. Considering the recent patent essentially details a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">lightweight DLSS</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2, we are unlikely to see the same identical desktop Transformer model running on the system due to computational limitations.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. More information on the console will be revealed in a dedicated Direct scheduled for early April.</p>

			<p>The Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director is reportedly leaving BioWare after having worked on the game since February 2022.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<span>reliable journalist <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Grubb</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer reported</a></span>, Corinne Busche will depart the team responsible for so many excellent role-playing games in the coming weeks. The studio, on the other hand, will not be affected by any other changes. According to Eurogamer, the game's performance on the market did not affect this departure.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard definitely did have an easy development. The new entry in the celebrated series has been in the works for over ten years and went through a few development reboots before finally releasing last year. Despite all the development troubles, the game turned out well, as Alessio highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, but sales likely haven't been stellar, as both BioWare and EA have not commented on them since launch.</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-denies-report-it-could-have-shut-down-xbox-business-in-2021/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, tech insider website The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella faced a difficult choice in 2021 regarding the Xbox business. He could either wind down the whole thing or double down by making massive investments, such as the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (following that of Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax).</p>
<p>He obviously chose the latter option. However, The Information makes the case that the gaming business is failing to keep up with Microsoft's growth plans despite these investments, starting with the fact that they didn't even come close to reaching the 11% target necessary to trigger Nadella's bonus, since growth stopped at 5.8%. It was the only division that fell short of reaching the bonus threshold for the Microsoft CEO.</p>
<p>The Information also shared a few comments on the situation gathered from investors and analysts. Denny Fish, a Janus Henderson Investors portfolio manager whose clients own over $800 million in Microsoft stock, said that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard has been disappointing so far.</p>
<p><em>It’s also a business that had some degree of consistency over, like, a three- to five-year period but was highly volatile from year to year, because you’re so dependent on the big releases like Call of Duty.</em></p>
<p>Truthfully, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did very well this year</a>, though the jury is still out on whether its day-one inclusion on Game Pass was beneficial from a financial standpoint. Despite the boasting about record numbers, Microsoft did not reveal any updated figures for Game Pass subscriptions. The last official number we have is February 2024's 34 million subscribers. As a reminder, the original plan before the Activision buyout was to reach 100 million active subscribers by 2030.</p>
<p>This was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Pachter's prediction</a> for when the Activision titles would be added to Game Pass. Most of them are there now, though, and clearly, the numbers aren't anywhere near that lofty figure. Pachter still sounds confident in the plan, anyway. Here's what he told The Information:</p>
<p><em>Seventy billion dollars is not a pittance—it’s a lot of cash. They might lose money in the short term, which is fine, as long as they can prove that in the long run Game Pass is a solid source of recurring revenue.</em></p>
<p>Another investment manager, Gus Zinn from Macquarie Science and Technology Fund, has a different view:</p>
<p><em>I just think the majority of the game market doesn’t really want a Game Pass.</em></p>
<p>There are highly conflicting views on Microsoft's game subscription service. Some developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-sales-higher-rockfish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absolutely swear by it</a>, while others are skeptical, to say the least. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to former GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring</a>, developers can usually expect to lose up to 80% of premium sales on Xbox consoles if their game is on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Anyway, a Microsoft spokesperson has now denied the aforementioned rumor that Satya Nadella could have shut down Xbox a few years back. In a statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-deny-report-regarding-financial-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Insider Gaming</a>, they have noted Microsoft CEO's prior comments about being <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-were-all-in-on-games-xbox-series-sx-are-our-fastest-selling-consoles-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-in on gaming</a>.</p>
<p>On another, not entirely unrelated note, Microsoft has cut some jobs in gaming as well as other divisions (security, devices, experiences), as <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-lays-off-more-staff-in-gaming-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by PC Mag</a>. The cuts are reportedly very small compared to last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive 1900+ layoffs in January</a>.</p>
