			<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pcjsy3/eidos_montreals_current_state_cancelling_several/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> on Reddit's r/gamingleaksandrumors channel, renowned developer Eidos Montréal appears to have laid off more employees for the third time in less than two years.</p>



<p>The first time was in January 2024, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the new Deus Ex project they had been working on got canceled by parent company Embracer Group. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-new-game-pitched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the project was then shopped around to other publishers, but none picked it up because they felt it was too niche.</p>



<p>At the end of March 2025, Eidos Montréal <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost another 75 employees</a> after its work on Playground's Fable reboot ended. Now, the number of people who just lost their jobs is unclear, but their CVs reveal that the Canadian studio had been working on a now-canceled dark fantasy action roleplaying game focused on melee combat and parkour, based on the revival of an established vampire franchise. Needless to say, this appears to be a fairly obvious reference to Legacy of Kain.</p>



<p>The IP originally created by Silicon Knights and later developed by Crystal Dynamics has been dormant for a long time, following the unsuccessful multiplayer action game, Nosgoth, developed by Psyonix and published by Square Enix. Three years ago, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-confirms-taking-control-of-tomb-raider-legacy-of-kain-and-other-ips-from-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained the rights</a> to Legacy of Kain (as well as Tomb Raider and other IPs) from Square Enix. Shortly after that, Phil Rogers, then CEO of both Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-fans-rejoice-eidos-heard-you-loud-and-clear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a major tease to fans</a> that the vampire IP would not be left to waste.</p>



<p>It seems that an attempt was indeed made, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remastered release of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2</a> was likely part of a broader strategy to revive interest in the IP; however, the project was ultimately scrapped. According to the unearthed information, the studio also canceled a 'modern point and click game with turn-based combat', while the status of another project, a 3v3 competitive eSports game taking place in a futuristic setting, is unknown.</p>



<p>Eidos Montréal hasn't released a game of its own since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, which debuted in October 2021. They did, however, co-develop <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grounded 2</a> with Obsidian Games, and apparently, that part of their outsourcing work is still active. </p>



<p>Still, it's a shame they are unable to make a new game in once high-profile franchises like Deus Ex and Legacy of Kain. This inevitably casts a shadow on the storied studio's future.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, the development team behind the free-to-play third-person looter shooter game The First Descendant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNh7vwqYdvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared in an official livestream</a> to outline the December update and the roadmap for the first half of next year.</p>



<p>The December update adds the new Descendant Ultimate Yujin, who's revealed through Yujin's Descendant Story. Ultimate Yujin features a hybrid playstyle with two Ultimate Skill Modules: </p>



<ul>
<li>Combat Protocol, which introduces a new combat-focused playstyle that lets him sustain his HP while dealing damage.</li>



<li>Battlefield Medic, which offers a support-oriented style that grows stronger the more he assists his allies.</li>
</ul>



<p>Players can also explore the new Forbidden Sanctuary dungeon, an experimental facility in Axion that supports multiplayer co-op and features a challenging new boss. The Forbidden Sanctuary offers key rewards for acquiring Ultimate Yujin.</p>



<p>The December update will also introduce The Grim Reaper, a new Abyss Colossus and a mutated form of Death Stalker, which offers a poison-based challenge that requires The First Descendant players to master its mechanics through careful strategy and timing.</p>



<p>Some Descendants, including Ajax, Freyna, Valby, and Viessa, along with select weapons, will also receive balance adjustments to enhance playstyles and skill performance. Moreover, a new Bunny-exclusive External Component, Sprint Accelerator, will be added, and players will be able to trade Ancestors Modules via the Trade Market.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When it comes to next year's roadmap, the developers have decided to delay the debut of Season 4 from early 2026 to Summer so that they can perform an overhaul of the core experience and systems. The goal is to provide players with a clearer loop: set a goal, farm and experiment with builds, and then tackle structured endgame, especially on “Hard” and above difficulties. In the meantime, Season 3 will continue with Episodes 3 and 4. Even Episode 2 will get something in January with the addition of Breach Tracking, a gold‑oriented farming activity where fields and missions are selected at random and can also drop items like superconductive cooling units.</p>



<p>Season 3 Episode 3 will go live in February 2026, introducing the beta version of the new Onslaught Mode to The First Descendant. This is a four‑player endgame mode where parties of four players face waves of increasingly powerful enemies, strategically placing turrets and buffs using resources gained during battle. The full version is planned to go live with the May update.</p>



<p>Episode 3 also introduces regular Descendant Dia with a main story centered on her, while Episode 4 adds one new Ultimate Descendant. Late during Episode 4, the developers will revamp Hard-mode Void Intercept Battles, turning this activity into a multi‑tier endgame pillar; until the new variant arrives, deep‑Void bosses will rotate monthly so older skins, cosmetics, and previously unobtainable deep‑Void Descendant skins can be farmed again.</p>



<p>Farming at Hard difficulty and above will be restructured around an Operation Command/Directive system, where players first choose the item they want to farm and then clear assigned missions for rewards, with the entire high‑level farming experience being rebuilt.</p>



<p>The Arche Tuning/Mutant Cell system is also being redesigned from fragmented A/B/C item drops into selectable nodes, making it easier to understand what benefits a Descendant and where to get it. Moreover, Stat display will be overhauled so final damage and contributions from modules, reactions, tuning, and externals can be viewed and “simulated” in one menu, reducing reliance on the lab for testing.</p>



<p>Finally, the team revealed that Season 4, currently scheduled to hit live servers in Summer 2026, brings Karel's final battle arc plus a large‑scale Mega Dungeon that surpasses current infiltration operations and Void Vessels in scope and spectacle, alongside a complete weapon system overhaul and the introduction of Transcendent‑tier weapons with a more farming‑centric, less grindy progression model.</p>



<p>The First Descendant <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in July 2024</a> and immediately garnered the attention of many players who were looking for an alternative to existing looter shooters, such as Destiny 2 or The Division 2. NEXON soon boasted that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-celebrates-10m-players-in-first-week-responds-to-allegations-of-copying-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been played by ten million users just in its launch week</a>, although it didn't take long for it to start losing steam, which is why the studio is now trying to overhaul the game's foundation.</p>



<p>On a technical level, the game was pretty advanced. It was the first title to integrate Samsung's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+ Gaming feature</a>, and it was also the first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-is-the-first-ps5-pro-game-to-combine-pssr-with-amd-fsr-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution alongside AMD's FSR Frame Generation on the PlayStation 5 Pro console</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is taking a major step forward as it ages into the back half of the decade <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-gameplay-trailer/">with the release of its expansion, War Sails</a>. The action strategy game is finally adding naval combat in this expansion, and ahead of its release, I got to spend some time hearing about it from developer TaleWorlds Entertainment.</p>



<p>I also got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-qa-interview-with-taleworlds-entertainment/">speak with a couple members of the development team, senior producer Falk Engel and design lead Gökçen Karaağaç</a>, all about this expansion and how it changes Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II, and why TaleWorlds Entertainment is calling this its "<em>biggest expansion ever</em>."</p>



<p>I want to start by saying I'm very new to strategy games. I've previously avoided them because whenever I saw gameplay clips, no matter which specific strategy game it was, it all seemed like it moved too slowly for me. I was also concerned with not being able to really grasp the mechanics, and was overall concerned that I would just not be very good at the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Screenshot_03-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But at the same time, I also knew these concerns were holding me back from an entire genre of video games I knew I might seriously enjoy, particularly when it comes to the strategy games that integrate historical elements into their gameplay. Wanting and willing to finally overcome those concerns is what drove me to Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails, and after spending some time with the game, I can confidently say: I was right to be concerned, I am not very good at these games.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I was also wrong to be concerned, because I'm still having a great time. It helps that this feels like a fresh start, not just for me, but for Bannerlord as well. With the release of War Sails, old saves are getting wiped, and it's a fresh new Caladria to explore on land and on sea.</p>



<p>"<em>Mount and Blade has always been about freedom, it's meant to be a blank slate for you to write your own stories</em>," as TaleWorlds Entertainment's Antonio Santo said in the opening to the studio's presentation ahead of release. You can't get more 'blank slate' than new saves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Gameplay_Screenshot_03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels understandable, then, that the cost of this expansion, which is $24.99 USD at regular price (currently $22.49 with its introductory 10% off sale), is half the price of the base game (when the base game isn't on sale like it is right now for half-price, which means with the base game at $24.99 and War Sails at $22.49, you get both for the price of Bannerlord not on sale). </p>



<p>I won't be going into detail about the War Sails storyline, purely to avoid spoilers and also because I'm not through all of it. What I can say is that while it does take a bit to get going since you need to scale your naval capabilities and party size to really get a feel for it, I now can't imagine playing Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord without War Sails and without naval combat. In a lot of ways, it really does feel like a whole new arm of the game has been added, and can now be improved upon.</p>



<p>Which is to say, there's incredible potential here, and while War Sails perhaps doesn't deliver on everything you'd want right away with the addition of naval combat, it sets a strong foundation for what could be next.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Screenshot_01-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For one thing, the sailing is wonderfully intricate and fun to try to master. Mastering maneuverability with your own ship, and especially with a whole fleet of ships, creates an incredible spectacle in naval battles. Even if most of my battles did devolve into smash-and-board skirmishes mostly, the wonderful backdrops and learning how to navigate the conditions, paired with a strong soundtrack, strike at the core of what Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord does best.</p>



<p>And the battles where I employed more strategy than just a head-on assault were all the more rewarding because of how challenging it was to work against the wind and stormy conditions. Large-scale battles are where Mount and Blade is at its best, and that's true for its land battles, and now, naval battles.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Gameplay_Screenshot_01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, combat isn't the only area of Mount and Blade that was changed with the addition of naval combat. In his presentation about War Sails, senior producer Falk Engel said, "<em>Even before the full release of the main title, we started receiving many community requests for a naval</em> <em>expansion. By the time we had finished our work on the core game, it was clear that this type of content would be one of the best additions that we could make. Why? Because the addition of the naval dimension allows us to build upon the wide range of gameplay and content, without taking from what people already know and love</em>."</p>



<p>Which is exactly what TaleWorlds Entertainment did, as the naval expansion not only introduced naval combat, but also changes to the game's economy, to trading, to the balance of importance between cities. Coastal cities like Chaikand are now even more important as a hub for trade. You even get a new port area you can walk around that's tuned to each nation.</p>



<p>Speaking of nations, War Sails also brings the Nords back into the equation, an inclusion that design lead Gökçen Karaağaç told me was introduced partly for nostalgia, partly because they were "<em>easy to justify"</em> introducing. "<em>Oh, they were always up there, and now they've started to pick up their ships and come here</em>," he said in our interview.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount__Blade_Bannerlord_War_Sails_Nords_Screenshot_no_logo_01-2-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Nords, an entire new area to explore, new campaigns, and an entire new frontier of combat are altogether a sizeable addition to Mount and Blade, though they're by no means perfect. Even with TaleWorlds Entertainment putting out several patches since launch, the odd bug feels bound to happen. Thankfully, it's not been anything too severe, like issues with the game crashing on me consistently; it's been more firmly in the funny, sometimes ruinous, freezes and hitches that, as I said, aren't too bad, but are consistent enough that I expect them.</p>



<p>Of course, they hurt far more when you are, as I did, going against the advice Karaağaç provided, which was "<em>do not sail a ship that you can't afford to lose</em>." The stakes are already high enough with how much it means to lose a ship, or multiple ships, in a battle, and especially because most engagements, once you've boarded an enemy ship, can result in unwinnable situations if you're not careful with how you move across the deck of your ship. Losing your ship and the battle because of an untimely freeze doesn't feel great, no matter how you slice it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mount-Blade-II-Bannerlord-Screenshot-2025.12.03-00.21.08.001.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: TaleWorlds Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But bugs can be patched, and at least in this case, they don't ruin the entire experience. War Sails is a more than solid expansion for Mount and Blade, laying an excellent foundation for future evolutions that I feel is particularly strong because of how welcoming it is to strategy-game newcomers. Hopefully, now, it won't be another five years before the next major expansion.</p>
