			<p><strong>Update 20/08/2025:</strong> Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter) spotted that Best Buy has already listed the prices for the ROG Xbox Ally and the Xbox Ally X, confirming the prices leaked by Billbil-kun below. Pre-orders are not yet live, but should be any moment, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/">Billbil-kun already reported that they would go live today.</a></p>

<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Xbox has announced the official release date for the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X at Gamescom 2025, which will officially launch this coming October 16, 2025.</p>



<p>The news was announced during Xbox's first day of livestreaming during this year's Gamescom, but it's not news for anyone that's been paying attention to the ROG Xbox Ally, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">Billbil-kun from Dealabs leaked the release date last week</a>.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun even leaked the prices, though Xbox has yet to confirm them at the time of this writing. Earlier today,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billbil-kun.bsky.social/post/3lwt47zevds24"> in a Bluesky post</a>, they claimed the US prices would be <strong>$549.99 </strong>for the ROG Xbox Ally and <strong>$899.99</strong> for the ROG Xbox Ally X. Billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">leaked the European prices last month</a>.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Gamescom live stream also went over a few details for the Ally, like the fact that it will come with Microsoft's Co-Pilot for Gaming built in, and that games will carry a performance tag similar to what Valve has for the Steam Deck. Instead of something being 'Ally verified' or not, games will carry one of three tags telling players what kind of performance they can expect.</p>



<p>If the game in question has been tested and can hit at least 30FPS on the ROG Xbox Ally, it'll get a "<em>Should perform well on this device</em>" tag. If it has been tested and can hit at least 60FPS, it'll have a "<em>Should perform great on this device</em>" tag. If it's not been tested, it'll have a "<em>Performance check not available yet</em>" tag.</p>

<iframe title="Introducing Handheld Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQiwumMYsGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding that testing, Xbox also introduced its Handheld Compatibility Program, which is "<em>a new Xbox initiative designed to make more games ready to play on your supported handheld</em>,"<em> </em>according to an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-october-features/">Xbox Wire post</a>. Xbox has been working with studios to test "<em>thousands of games for handheld compatibility,"</em> to ensure they're ready for players picking up an Ally this coming October.</p>



<p>It's nice to see the release date get an official confirmation, even if the news was spoiled before Xbox got the chance to shout it out itself. Hopefully, we'll have the prices confirmed soon. </p>

			<p>Where Winds Meet, the free-to-play open-world action-adventure RPG from Everstone Studio and NetEase will launch in the Western world on PS5 and PC this coming November 14, 2025, Everstone and NetEase have announced.</p>



<p>The game initially launched on PC in China in December 2024, followed by an iOS and Android launch this past January. It's been a long time coming to PS5, as lead designer Chris Lyu explains in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/where-winds-meet-launches-november-14/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that the November date will be the culmination of five years worth of work at Everstone Studio.</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve crafted this game with care, pouring our hearts into every detail over the past five years, and we’re beyond excited to share it with the world," </em>Lyu writes.</p>

<p>The final PC and PS5 test for Where Winds Meet was <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/">held last month</a> ahead of this November launch, and around that time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got the chance to speak to Everstone Studio</a> and, more specifically, today's PS Blog author, Chris Lyu, about the coming title. </p>



<p>At the time, Lyu told Wccftech, "<em>Our main goal has always been to share the world of Eastern martial arts in a way that feels new, exciting, and approachable for players everywhere. We want to present something truly different, but also make sure it’s easy for everyone to connect with, using familiar language and storytelling styles."</em></p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how that resonates with players when it arrives on PC and PS5 on November 14, 2025.</p>
