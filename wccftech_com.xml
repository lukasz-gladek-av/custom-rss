			<p>No ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off following the cancellation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">Project Blackbird</a>, a new statement shared online confirmed.</p>



<p>ZOS United-CWA released a new statement on Bluesky yesterday, commenting on the cancellation of the project, which came as a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on it, and showing appreciation for the media and players that would have loved to see the game. Unlike what happened at other studios, which saw layoffs following the cancellation of their projects, no ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off. Although the future remains uncertain, as Microsoft and the union established in December 2024 are still discussing how the studio will move forward following the project closure, the developers who worked on Project Blackbird still remain at ZeniMax Online with full pay and benefits. Layoffs may still be in the future for some of the members of the union, but as a result of organizing, those impacted will be able to depart the studio with dignity.</p>







<p>As already mentioned, ZeniMax Online Project Blackbird is not the only project that Microsoft confirmed to have cancelled earlier this month. The Perfect Dark reboot announced back in 2020 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">ceased development</a>, and its development studio, The Initiative, has been shut down. Rare's Everwild was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancelled</a>, while other studios have been considerably downsized, such as Turn 10, the developer of the Forza Motorsport series, which has reportedly become a <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/">Forza Horizon support studio.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/interviewing-mike-bithell-ygf/">John Wick Hex</a> is being delisted this week, publisher Big Fan Games has announced. It'll be entirely removed from sale on all digital platforms as of <strong>July 17, 2025</strong>. If you've already bought the game, you'll be able to continue playing it and redownload it, but if not, you'll miss out on your chance to get the game, seemingly forever. </p>



<p>The news was announced quite suddenly this week, giving players only days to decide whether they wanted to grab it before its gone, or let it pass them by for good. John Wick Hex is critically acclaimed as one of the best games based on a film or TV show in some time, including by Wccftech, who called it "<em>an action choreography masterclass</em>" when <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/">we reviewed it back when it launched in October 2019 on PC</a>. It was out on consoles a year later, in December 2020.</p>



<p>"<em>John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17th, 2025,</em>" a statement on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675?l=english">Steam page</a> began. "<em>After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Consoles) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront</em>." No reason for the delisting has been given.</p>



<p>With the game being removed in just two days at the time of this writing, that puts its shelf life at less than six years since its release, a short lifetime even for a game based on a licensed series. If anything, it's a wonder why there haven't been more John Wick games, since the release of John Wick Hex was such a critical success. The films have also only grown in success and popularity in the last six years, and with all the collaboration between the video game industry and Hollywood of late, you'd think someone would have been working on making another John Wick game happen.</p>



<p>"<em>When all is said and done, John Wick Hex is an exceptional licensed game, and a wonderful strategic shooter even away from that,</em>" our review reads. "<em>It's the kind of game that's high quality and enjoyable, even if you are clueless about the John Wick movies themselves. The perfect kind of licensed game, that works as well as an introduction to the franchise as it does as an extension of it. Absolutely worth playing</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-5-is-%E2%80%9Cfully-greenlit%E2%80%9D-according-to-a-new-report.1244106/</guid>

			<p>Now that Starfield has come and gone, the next major title Bethesda fans are waiting for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. After that, it'll be time for Fallout 5 to finally take center stage in the theatre of Bethesda's development efforts. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-will-follow-elder-scrolls-vi-starfields-procedural-generation-discussed/">That's been the plan</a>, according to Bethesda and Todd Howard, who, at this point, will likely finish his career with the release of Fallout 5, considering how long modern video games take to make. According to Windows Central reporter Jez Corden, speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DDr2ZSFIEXk?t=3845s">XB2 podcast</a>, the first major step in making Fallout 5 a reality has been taken, as the game is now "<em>fully greenlit."</em></p>



<p>That said, there's not a lot of clarity as to who is leading the project. According to Corden, a significant number of Bethesda's developers are working on more DLC for Starfield. The remaining staff are full-steam-ahead on The Elder Scrolls VI. Fallout 5 might have been officially added to the docket, but when it enters full production, and who will even be leading the way, isn't entirely clear.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Howard and his team are the obvious guess, but who knows what Bethesda and Microsoft will look like by the time Fallout 5 is ready to be the full focus of the studio. For now, despite claims that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/">Fallout 5 might be moved up the priority list thanks to the success of the TV show</a>, it seems like it'll be a number of years before Fallout 5 is out and on shelves.</p>
