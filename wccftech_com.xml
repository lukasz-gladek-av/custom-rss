			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may be comparable to the PlayStation 4 in terms of system specifications, but some of its features allow the system to push past the quality level offered by the previous-generation system.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">IGN</a> about the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077</a>, CD Projekt Red VP of Technology Charles Tremblay commented on the development of the port, which began in Summer 2023, and some of the challenges the developer had to overcome to get the game running on the system, such as the many changes that had to be done on the engine level due to the system using a different architecture than the x86 architecture upon which the game was built. NVIDIA DLSS was also a key tool in ensuring the game could run as well as possible on the Nintendo Switch 2, allowing CDPR to bring the quality to another level, besides their technology scaling well across all platforms.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS is just one of the Nintendo Switch 2 features that allow the system to push past the PlayStation 4 level of quality. According to Tremblay, the biggest problem with previous-generation consoles was the mechanical drive, an issue the next-generation Nintendo console doesn't have. The increased amount of available RAM is another thing that helps the Nintendo Switch 2 push past the PlayStation 4 level of quality, as it allows not only Cyberpunk 2077 to run better on the system, but also to have the Phantom Liberty expansion included in this new version of the game.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 is not comparable to the PC version in terms of visuals, and it was never intended to be the goal, CD Projekt Red has ensured it will be a very enjoyable experience tailored to the platform, with a 30 FPS that promises to stick to the target, and a 40 FPS which the CDPR VP of Technology feels that is a good compromise to the standard 60 FPS offered by most modern console games.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 this week, on June 5th.</p>

			<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign patch has gone live today, introducing changes to the single-player mode, tweaked Relics rewards, and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>The 1.01.1 patch, which is a little over 131 MB big on Steam, introduces the promised balance changes for the game's single-player mode, such as the introduction of the Automatic Revival Upon Defeat effect, which revives the Nightfarer once per night boss and an increase in runes gained, which should both make things slightly easier for solo players.</p>
<p>The new Elden Ring Nightreign patch also introduces some general balance changes, increasing the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward for reaching Day 3 and the increased probability of obtaining them from purchasing Scenic Flat stones from the Small Jar Bazaar. The patch also addresses a variety of bugs, including some PC-specific bugs like graphics not rendering properly at the low quality setting, and issues with Climb Up actions. You can find the full details about the fixes introduced by the new patch <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NIGHTREIGN-Patch1011">here.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about one of FromSoftware's most interesting games by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>
