			<p>Battlefield Studios, the collective name for the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a few balancing tweaks were rolled out to the game without the need for players to download a patch.</p>



<p>You can find the changes below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the M2010 ESR from 900 to 800 m/s</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the PSR from 750 to 720 m/s</li>



<li>Shotgun projectiles will now take drag into account.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this is just the beginning of the balancing effort. While the game launched in a solid state, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">concurrency records on Steam</a> and very positive reviews from critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including ours</a>), the community has already requested other changes and the developers will have to continue monitoring the live service situation.</p>



<p>In other news, Reddit users have started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o64hvu/cronus_zen_users_on_ps5_are_now_receiving/">reporting</a> that the developers' <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/">partnership with Sony and Microsoft against the usage of Cronus Zen devices</a> for cheats is paying off. The first permabans have already been dealt, and indeed, the people behind the Cronus Zen have reportedly recommended avoiding using the device for now:</p>



<p><em>We're currently advising all Battlefield 6 players, especially those on PC using the Zen with any of our latest scripts, to pause usage for now. The team is actively testing to understand what's causing it and ensure everything remains safe and stable. Please avoid using the Zen in Battlefield 6 until we confirm it's fine to resume. We also ask that no one publicly shares or discusses any bans — this draws unnecessary attention to the community and makes testing more difficult. </em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-will-stick-making-one-game-at-a-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sucker-punch-suggests-it-will-stick-with-making-one-game-at-a-time-after-ghost-of-yotei.1324225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a post-mortem Ghost of Yotei interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Sucker Punch Studio Head and Co-Founder Brian Fleming suggested that the Bellevue-based developer will keep focusing on one game project at a time instead of attempting to juggle more than one.</p>



<p><em>The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time. If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.</em></p>



<p><em>So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. </em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Fleming also hinted that Sucker Punch has to deal with internal pressures from employees as well as external pressure from fans when it comes to potentially diversifying its output.</p>



<p><em>At 30 years, we now have employees who are kids of former employees. We have employees who weren’t born when the studio was founded. And you also have had enough changes from Sly, to InFamous, to Ghost that part of those changes, when they happen, is that it means not just you’re walking away from Tsushima, and not just that you’re walking away from the actors in Tsushima, but you’re walking away from employees who’ve been a part of the studio for the last decade, because they don’t want to do a game set in a historical setting.</em></p>



<p>As much as I'd love a new Infamous game, though, the Ghost of franchise has simply gotten too big. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the excellent Ghost of Yotei</a>, which seems to be selling almost as quickly as its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on initial estimates</a>, Sucker Punch owner Sony has also invested on a live action film that is being directed by Chad Stahelski and an anime based on the multiplayer mode, Legends. Chances are the developers will be put on Ghost-making duty for at least one more installment.</p>



<p>In related news, we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently published an interview with actor Feodor Chin</a> about his role as the main villain of Ghost of Yotei, Lord Saito.</p>

			<p>The additional content of the War of the Lions release may at very least have been considered for Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles at some point, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>Using a Cheat Engine table to alter in-game values, YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GusPagan">Gus Pagan</a> discovered that the remaster of the classic tactical role-playing game released last month on PC and consoles features hidden in its files evidence that the War of the Lions content, or at least part of it, may have been considered. This includes the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs and the extra characters Balthier and Luso.</p>



<p>As the implementation of these extra Jobs and characters is clearly incomplete, however, they could simply be leftover data that was carried over from the War of the Lions version code. Still, this could definitely bode well even if the extra content isn't officially released for the remaster, as modders could use this data to port the content themselves, <a href="https://ffhacktics.com/smf/index.php?topic=12951.0">something that has already happened for the original PSX version of the game.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>While having the exclusive War of the Lions content would make Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles the true definitive edition of the tactical role-playing game, in no way does the remaster need it to be an excellent game. Check out my review to learn <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">how choice improvements like voice acting and a tweaked user interface enhance an already excellent game.</a> </p>
