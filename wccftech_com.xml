			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake Born From a Wish DLC and the Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are likely to be announced soon, according to a known insider.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Speaking on X</a>, Dusk Golem, who correctly provided news regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-transmission-announcements/">the revival of the KONAMI survival horror series</a> before the official announcement, stated that new announcements regarding last year's remake of the second entry in the series, including the remade higly-requested DLC expansion, the Xbox Series X|S versions and a new PlayStation 5 Pro patch to address <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-playstation-5-pro-looks-better-performance-mode/">some of the issues still found in this version of the game</a> shouldn't be too far off in the future. The announcements are likely being tied to the promotional cycle and release window of the Return to Silent Hill movie, which is based on the second entry in the series and will launch on January 23, 2026.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) Silent Hill 2 Remake, the PS5 Pro patch likely be timed with some announcements, Born From a Wish DLC should be announced sooner or later, &amp; likely Konami is tying it around the window of the upcoming Return to Silent Hill movie based off SH2.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1975058939093078093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As Dusk Golem's track record isn't spotless, we have to take today's statements with a massive grain of salt. At the same time, the Silent Hill 2 remake official website was updated over the past few days in a way that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nyr5z9/in_bloober_teams_website_silent_hill_2_remakes/"> suggests the remake could launch on other formats in the future</a>, so there's little doubt that KONAMI and Bloober Team are likely gearing up for some announcement, in light of the game's PS5 console exclusivity ending on October 8.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake launching on other gaming systems is good news, as the remake developed by Bloober Team is a game that any survival horror fan should experience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outsiders, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-hellsinger-rock-on/">rhythm FPS game Metal: Hellsinger</a>, has been shut down as part of Funcom's <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/">recently confirmed layoffs</a>. Funcom's Stockholm studio has also been impacted as part of the cuts, though it's unclear if the entire branch has been shuttered as well.</p>



<p>Former studio creative director and founder David Goldfarb <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1975200395128610955">confirmed the news in a statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, saying, "<em>I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm</em> <em>have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing." </em></p>



<p>"<em>Many of us have survived</em> <em>a near-death studio experience years back when Darkborn was cancelled, and because of this team's loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal: Hellsinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.</em></p>



<p><em>We had hoped to do something even better this time - things don't always go the way you hope. But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting. Thanks so much</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Goldfarb also posted the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/locust9_friends-i-have-not-had-much-time-to-process-activity-7380961160872841216-XIbs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">same statement to his LinkedIn account</a>, where he added that writing the statement "<em>sucked</em>" and that he was "<em>afraid to press post because it will make it real. Oh well.</em>"</p>



<p>Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-acquires-majority-stake-in-the-outsiders-founds-new-romanian-studio/">acquired The Outsiders back in 2021</a>, while the two studios were already working on Metal: Hellsinger with Funcom as the game's publisher. The studio had been independent for six years before being acquired.</p>



<p>When the layoffs at Funcom were confirmed last week, Funcom did not initially say how many developers were impacted. According <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-acquires-majority-stake-in-the-outsiders-founds-new-romanian-studio/">to The Outsiders' official website,</a> at least 30 developers were employed at the Sweden-based studio. </p>



<p>In Funcom's statement regarding its layoffs, it claimed that its new survival MMO, Dune: Awakening, was "<em></em><em>the biggest release we've had in our 32-year-long history of making great games</em>." The cuts were made due to Funcom deciding it did not need the same number of developers as work on Dune: Awakening transitioned from developing for launch to maintaining it and creating new content.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Activision Says It Is Catching “97% of Cheaters” in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Beta “Within 30 Minutes”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-cheaters-caught-within-30-minutes-activision/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-says-it-is-catching-%E2%80%9C97-of-cheaters%E2%80%9D-in-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-%E2%80%9Cwithin-30-minutes%E2%80%9D.1317502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-october/">multiplayer beta is officially live</a> as of this past weekend and open to the entire public as of yesterday, October 5. When it launched, even in its early access state, reports began appearing online that <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-cheaters-already-running-amuck/">cheaters were already running amuck throughout the beta</a>. </p>



<p>As we come out of the early access period and into the all-public period of the beta, Activision updated players on the state of cheaters in a long post on <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1974942752485077132">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where it claimed that it was catching "<em>97% of cheaters</em>" within "<em>30 minutes of their first sign-in</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Cheaters were expected</em>," Team Ricochet writes. "<em>But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat. Those who did manage to slip through didn't last long. Most never made it into a match.</em> <em>You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta. We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We're watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>And this is just the beginning. When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat defenses will only grow stronger</em>."</p>



<p>The post continues with Team Ricochet and Activision not only claiming that 97% of cheaters were caught within half an hour, but that "<em>fewer than 1% of cheating attempts reached a match, and those who did were removed within minutes</em>."</p>



<p>Team Ricochet also went on to say that it is bringing the fight directly to cheat vendors and that is has "<em>directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since Black Ops 6 launched</em>. <em>Vendors sharing clips during Beta were already on our radar and we will purse them beyond in-game enforcement</em>."</p>



<p>While players would generally agree it's a good thing that cheaters aren't overrunning and ruining their multiplayer experience, there are still many who aren't happy about the kernel-level protection Activision has pushed to make this work. To those players, Team Ricochet simply said, "<em>We</em> <em>understand that new security measures like TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot checks can sometimes feel disruptive. But these steps help ensure a secure, fair experience for every player, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we strengthen PC protections.</em>"</p>



<p>Whether what Activision and Team Ricochet lines up with your experience in the multiplayer beta or not, it's clear that Activision is trying to send a message to players that it is taking cheaters in Call of Duty very seriously. But that only works if these numbers and any future cheater reports Team Ricochet puts out accurately represent the state of the multiplayer experience on Call of Duty.</p>



<p>The first comments below this post include players <a href="https://x.com/tq57l/status/1975065774730735927">claiming they were shadowbanned when they weren't cheating</a>, players pointing out that <a href="https://x.com/JediJoystick/status/1975040453067284798">reactive measures don't do enough to stop cheaters from ruining a player's multiplayer experience</a>, that the wording in this statement <a href="https://x.com/ItsMeChalks/status/1974955542453026903">only refers to the cheaters Team Ricochet were able to detect</a>, and others <a href="https://x.com/ShutUpBruv1/status/1975056289949753564">claiming that they've still seen scores of cheaters in their matches</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, if you haven't seen cheaters in your matches, and by your experience, the anti-cheat system is working, you might be too busy having fun in the beta to comment on these posts. Spending any significant amount of time on the internet will teach you that people will complain more than they'll speak up about how good things are going.</p>



<p>And while Activision and Team Ricochet are putting on a strong face against cheaters currently, the true test will be how the game looks in six months, and if cheating is still as significant an issue as it's been in previous years. </p>



<p>"<em>The fight against cheating is an industry-wide challenge - and we're committed to leading the charge,</em>" Team Ricochet and Activision write. "<em>We continue to bring new systems online during beta, fine-tuning our protections, responding faster and gaining deeper insights. We're dedicated to transparency, community feedback, and constant evolution in our fight for fair play</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingmakers’ Early Access Release Has Been Delayed, No New Release Date In Sight]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingmakers-early-access-release-delayed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingmakers%E2%80%99-early-access-release-has-been-delayed-no-new-release-date-in-sight.1317424/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kingmakers, the third-person action time-travelling game that gives you a truck and an assault rifle against legions of medieval-era knights with nothing but swords and horses, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingmakers-the-medieval-based-third-person-action-game-that-pits-assault-rifles-against-swords-launches-in-early-access-this-october/">initially meant to release in early access on PC later this week,</a> on October 8, 2025. Now, that's no longer the case, and the game's release has been delayed with no new release date in sight.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1974144040942625003">In a long statement posted to the X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the game, developer Redemption Road Games confirmed it needs more time to polish the game, rather than "<em>cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door</em> <em>earlier</em>." What will be coming soon, is a half-hour gameplay deep-dive digging into the gameplay, and updating players on what the team has been working on. </p>



<p>"<em>After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch on October 8 will no longer be possible</em>," the studio confirmed at the top of its statement. "<em>We want to apologize to all the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short: it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door</em> <em>earlier.</em> <em>Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that's nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity</em>.</p>



<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently</em> <em>have tens of thousands of soldiers,</em> <em>each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you'd expect from a AAA third-person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it's a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena...</em></p>



<p><em>...We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kingmakers is one of the few indie games that, when it first gets announced, <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1759943842466582568">has a viral moment and is suddenly in front of millions of eyes</a>. It has <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1868768562388910113">over a million wishlists on Steam</a> thanks to that first burst of virality, but hype fades as easily as it builds.</p>



<p>Whenever Kingmakers does release, we'll see if it is any deeper than the viral mix of driving a truck through hundreds of knights that can't do anything about it. Perhaps the coming gameplay deep-dive will begin to do away with those concerns, and of course, with it being an early access title, there will likely be plenty of time for it to develop and get better based on community feedback.</p>
