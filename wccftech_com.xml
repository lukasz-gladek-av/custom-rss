			<p>Skate is out in its early access form, and developer Full Circle and EA are preparing to launch the game's first major content update with the release of Season 1 coming next week on October 7, 2025. A new trailer shows off several of what's to come, like new skate-able areas, new cosmetics for players to earn, the introduction of the Skate Pass, and seasonal events, while <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/skate-season-1">a blog post on the Skate website</a> goes into more detail on everything.</p>



<p>The Skate Pass will introduce daily, weekly, and seasonal tasks that give you various bonuses for completing them, seasonal challenges, and if you purchase the premium version, daily grants for players.</p>



<p>Also included in the Season 1 update will be seasonal events like Skate-O-Ween, the Halloween-themed event Skate will host this month. As EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-early-access-roadmap-ea-full-circle/">previously announced, all of these additions (new areas, cosmetics, seasonal events, etc.)</a> are what you can expect to see in every new season of Skate.</p>

<p>Full Circle and EA's new iteration on the once-beloved skateboarding series has been met with mixed results, to say the least. On the one hand, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/skate-leads-augusts-top-games-by?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=175193486&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">Alinea Analytics reports that the game is reaching staggeringly high player numbers</a>, and was one of September's leading games in terms of revenue earned.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the game has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review">critically panned by some</a> and heavily criticized online for being a live-service, microtransaction-forward re-shaping of the series.</p>



<p>Regardless, player numbers and revenue intake all point to this new Skate game having a strong start. The question, of course, is whether it can keep this momentum up, or if the game will drop off and out of the spotlight even before it can exit early access.</p>
