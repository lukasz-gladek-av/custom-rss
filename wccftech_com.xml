			<p>After at least two years of speculation, the Nintendo Switch 2 was finally unveiled earlier this month. Over the last couple of weeks, Nintendo has confirmed many details for its upcoming console, and we'll endeavor to compile them all in this article.</p>
<h2>Release date and pricing</h2>
<p>On April 2, 2025, a dedicated Nintendo Direct stream <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 would launch on June 5, 2025. The pricing was not mentioned at all during the one-hour show, but it was communicated immediately afterward in the press releases and on the official website.</p>
<p>The new console is priced at $449.99 in the United States, $629.99 in Canada, $699 in Australia, €469.99 in Europe, and £395.99 in the United Kingdom. Japan will get <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusively cheaper version</a> at ¥49,980 (around $330), but this version is region-locked. A region-free version will only be sold in the country via Nintendo's online store.</p>
<p>Pre-orders opened in most countries on April 9. However, they were delayed in the United States and Canada due to the looming threat of Donald Trump's US tariffs. Analysts and customers alike were very worried that Nintendo would be forced to increase the price of the Nintendo Switch 2, which was already higher than the rumors had suggested prior to the announcement.</p>
<p>Thankfully, earlier today, Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that there would be no price increases for the hardware. The same won't apply to accessories, though, which all received a price bump.</p>

<h2>Hardware Specifications</h2>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 follows closely in the design footsteps of the predecessor. It wasn't since the Super Nintendo that the Japanese company decided on an iterative rather than innovative design.</p>
<p>The new console will still be a hybrid of handheld and home console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powered by NVIDIA Tegra technology</a>. Its screen is now considerably larger, has higher resolution (Full HD), supports High Dynamic Range, and has an NVIDIA G-SYNC-powered Variable Refresh Rate that goes up to 120 Hz. However, it is unclear if VRR is also available in docked mode because Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> that specific detail from several official websites. When docked, the Nintendo Switch 2 can reach 4K resolution at 60Hz, and the dock includes a cooling fan to help keep temperatures stable.</p>
<p>The integration of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution upscaling technology</a> (though other upscaling options are <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-nvidia-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also available to developers</a>) will undoubtedly be invaluable in achieving stable frame rates in this mode. The console technically supports ray tracing, too, but at this stage, it appears unlikely that most developers will take advantage of it, as it would weigh heavily on the hardware's capabilities.</p>
<p>The Joy-Con 2 controllers also return with improvements. They now attach magnetically to the console, which is sure to be a fan-favorite change. While the joysticks do not support Hall Effect sensors (despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors to the contrary</a>), Nintendo said they are smoother and also more reliable. The SL and SR buttons have been enlarged and will be easier to press, but the biggest addition is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers can be used like a computer mouse in games that support the feature by sliding them on their side.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is now a C button that activates the brand new Game Chat feature, which allows up to 12 users to join a voice chat while playing games (even different ones). Players can also share their screen in real time, and when connecting the USB-C camera accessory (sold separately), they can see each other in video chat. GameChat is being offered by Nintendo for free until March 31, 2026; afterward, users will need an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription to use it.</p>

In select cases, owners of a game on the original Switch will be able to upgrade to the improved Switch 2 version for $10. These are called 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Games', and there's currently twelve of them.</p>

<h2>Game Share</h2>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console allows users to share compatible games via the new Game Share feature so that you can play with friends and family who do not own a specific game. Interestingly, while only a Switch 2 console can initiate the sharing, a Switch 1 console can receive the sharing. This works locally and also online (albeit not with all games) via the aforementioned GameChat.</p>
<p>Here's the current list of titles with confirmed Game Share support:</p>

<h2>Backward Compatibility</h2>
<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 supports Switch games, with a single exception at the time being: Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. Not all games may run flawlessly, though. There is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official website</a> where users can track the backward compatibility status.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Joy-Con and Pro Controllers will be forward compatible with the console, too.</p>
<h2>First Impressions</h2>
<p>Wccftech was invited by Nintendo to attend the press-exclusive hands-on event that took place on the same day as the public reveal. Here's an excerpt from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Birch's first impressions article</a> about the new console:</p>
<p><em>If you’re one of the sizable number of folks who have affection for their trusty Switches, it seems quite likely you’ll enjoy the Switch 2. The system looks better, feels better, the Joy-Cons are sturdier and more versatile, and playing Nintendo games with some decent hardware grunt behind them is a nice change of pace. Whether the Switch 2 reaches the commercial heights of the OG Switch will largely depend on its library of games, but titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza show Nintendo can still deliver fun, and sometimes unexpected, experiences with their long-running franchises. While I need more time with the Switch 2 to render a final verdict, it feels like the pieces are there for another hybrid hit.</em></p>

			<p>We don't have a release date or a title for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-testing-environment-announced-first-pre-alpha-footage-of-next-entry-in-the-series-shown-in-new-video/">Battlefield</a> game coming out later in 2025, but EA is still showing off plenty of what's to come, and this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1517290/view/564746584593532093">latest update'll</a> make veteran fans particularly happy.</p>
<p>A Battlefield Labs update centered around destruction in the next Battlefield game shows a small clip of gameplay from the work-in-progress build, and it looks like the old-school destruction fans loved in earlier Battlefield titles is back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Community Update - Battlefield Labs - Destruction Example" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khjrOEs5R08?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/">The Battlefield Team</a>, which includes DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and EA Motive, first discussed their philosophy towards destruction in Battlefield.</p>
<p>"<em>Our goals for destruction are centered around adding further gameplay depth by allowing you to reshape the environment and transform your surroundings toward a tactical advantage.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>...We're designing destruction around easily identifiable visual and audio language that lets you understand what can be destroyed, altered, or transformed through gameplay. We aim to make destruction an integral part of your Battlefield experience to create an intuitive, fun, and rewarding environment where you feel empowered to shape the world around you.</em>"</p>
<p>The Battlefield Team also explains that environments will physically degrade from damage and that buildings will 'apple-core' as the exterior walls are destroyed before the core is completely destroyed.</p>
<p>"<em>New mechanics allow you to create more destruction-related opportunities during gameplay, as well as being able to influence your surroundings through the use of different weapons or vehicle types. For example, rubble caused by destruction now remains on the battlefield, and allows you to create and use new opportunities for cover and protection.</em>"</p>
<p>Destruction, like many aspects of the game, is still being tweaked and balanced based on feedback from players who've gotten the chance to play early builds of the game through the Battlefield Labs program. Which you can still sign up for, if you want the opportunity to help shape the future of the series.</p>
