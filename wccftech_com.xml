			<p>I am not going to lie: I love <strong>Team NINJA</strong>. If you have been checking out my coverage over the past few years, you likely know this already. Ever since first picking up the PlayStation port of <em>Dead or Alive</em>, I was hooked. There is a specific feel to their combat that <strong>no other developer quite replicates</strong>. That admiration for the studio founded by the legendary Tomonobu Itagaki, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/"><strong>who sadly passed away last October</strong></a>, only deepened as they pioneered the genres I love most: the high-octane character action of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/"><strong>Ninja Gaiden</strong></a></em> and the punishing Masocore depth of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-complete-edition/"><strong>Nioh</strong></a></em>. Even when they stumbled, as they did with the original <em>Ninja Gaiden 3</em>, their DNA remained unmistakable.</p>



<p>It is this refusal to be a mere imitator that allowed the <em>Nioh</em> series to <strong>thrive</strong> in the Soulslike flood of the 2010s and 2020s. While others were content to <strong>copy FromSoftware's homework</strong>, adding a few tweaks on the way,<strong> Team NINJA went their own way</strong>, crafting what I've always described as a <em>"Ninja Gaiden meets Diablo"</em> hybrid. It was a match made in heaven, or hell, depending on how many times a boss has sent you back to the shrine.</p>



<p>Following <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh 2</strong></a></em>, the studio entered a more experimental era that I still maintain is<strong> terribly underappreciated</strong>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/"><strong><em>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</em></strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/"><strong><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/"><strong><em>Rise of the Ronin</em></strong></a> are all deeply engaging titles whose reputations were unfairly marred by underwhelming visuals and launch-day performance issues. <strong>But these games didn't exist in a vacuum</strong>. On the contrary, the evolution of combat in <em>Stranger of Paradise</em>, the vertical stage design in<em> Wo Long</em>, and the movement and open world structure in <em>Ronin</em> were clearly <strong>stepping stones</strong> for <em>Nioh 3.</em></p>



<p>What we have now is a journey through time that, simply put, is excellent. A journey that, for me, confirms the high hopes I had during my <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><strong>extended preview session last year</strong></a>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is not just a sequel; it is the proper first new entry in the series<span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>one of the best games Team NINJA has ever made</strong>, held back only&nbsp;</span>by some technical issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-journey-through-japanese-history">A Journey Through Japanese History</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Story-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 bring players on a journey through time in search of Kunimatsu</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking a page from the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 2 </em>DLC expansions' overarching story involving <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">time travel</strong>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>'s story is centered on traveling through time to <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">different periods of Japanese </strong><strong>h</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">istory</strong> to put a stop to the evil that has been gripping the nation since <strong>Kunimatsu Tokugawa</strong> showed his true colors on the eve of the appointment as Shogun of <strong>Takechiyo Tokugawa</strong>, the game's fully customizable main character.</p>



<p>Kunimatsu's betrayal goes <strong>much deeper</strong> than just a struggle for power, as the hellish landscapes of the Crucibles, powered by the material known as Crucinite, are <strong>reshaping</strong> both the land of Japan and its history, giving extraordinary, and evil, powers to some of the <strong>central figures of Japanese history</strong>, such as Takeda Shingen and his generals, corrupting both their minds and their Guardian Spirits.</p>



<p>Guided by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Guardian Spirit Kusanagi</strong>, Takechiyo will travel to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warring States</strong> period to assist his grandfather, Ieyasu Tokugawa, against Takeda Shingen and his clan, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">taking part in famous battles</strong> such as the Battle of Mikatagahara, before continuing their journey across time to multiple time periods, including the <strong>Heian</strong> and <strong>Bakumatsu</strong> period, meeting and befriending real history figures of Japanese history.</p>

<p>In terms of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">story and characters</strong>, Nioh 3 doesn't differ much from its predecessors, combining real elements with a fantasy story featuring Yokai and other elements of Japanese folklore. While the plot isn't particularly deep, it is definitely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enjoyable</strong>, especially if you are into Japanese history, as many of the situations presented in the game are potential what-if scenarios of real history. With a few twists along the way, though far from being the central element of the experience, the story definitely gets its job done. I ultimately enjoyed <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 2</em>'s story a bit more for how it weaved the Shiftling Hide's story with Hideyoshi Toyotomi's, but it's more a matter of preference than <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> doing something worse in this regard.</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-reborn">Nioh Reborn</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Open-Fields-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Nioh 3'</em><em>s </em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">open-fields shake up the series formula significantly</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <em>Nioh 3</em> doesn't shake up the series' typical narrative and themes, the new entry in the series <strong>significantly alters the formula</strong> of its predecessors and other Team NINJA games, doing away with the overhead maps from which to select missions and linear stage design in favor of a more <strong>open-ended approach.</strong></p>



<p>Before release, the developer stressed multiple times that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not an open-world game</strong> but an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">open-field game</strong>, which connects the more linear locations that serve as the typical mission setting from the previous entry in the series.</p>



<p>I have to admit I wasn't too excited about <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">losing the immediacy that Team NINJA's games</strong> provided. I generally like open-world games, but I feel many <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fail at making traversing these big maps interesting after a dozen hours or so</strong>, bloating what could have been tighter experiences. However, after spending over 50 hours in <em>Nioh 3</em>, <strong>my fears have been allayed.</strong></p>



<p>Though the open-field maps in Nioh 3 diminish the immediacy of the experience,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">they in no way feel like a pointless bloating of the experience</strong>. They essentially function in the same way as the overhead maps did in previous entries in the series, only that now the player can look around to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">find all sorts of secrets</strong> inside chests, which include some critical parts of character progression such as Skills, Samurai and Ninja Points required to unlock Martial Arts via the game's numerous skill trees, fight formidable enemies and Masters to unlock new Martial Arts and Transformed Arts, unique variants of Martial Arts with altered elemental properties, start-up and recovery, rescue Kodama spirits and pray at Jizo Statues to unlock their Blessings and chase after Scampusses to find even more secrets.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-open-fields-challenges-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Challenges aplenty await Takechiyo in Nioh 3's open fields</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you played any of the previous entries in the series, you can probably already understand what <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> did: take most of the content upon which <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">separate sub-missions</strong> were built on, and placed them on a bigger map for a more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cohesive experience</strong>, where even usually shallow elements like enemy camps are twisted in a Nioh series fashion to provide even more challenges to face outside of the traditional missions. Delivering so many benefits that enhance <strong>combat and character progression</strong>, which are what Team NINJA always does best, <strong>exploring maps is both an integral part of the experience and one that is surprisingly fun.</strong></p>



<p>Exploring these open-field maps in Nioh 3 is made even better by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">solid</strong><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">, varied map design</strong>, which features</span> increased verticality thanks to the introduction of jumping. While the first few regions of the Warring States starting map may not seem all that interesting, everything past the first Crucible is <strong>much more interesting</strong>, with the complexity of each region increasing in the other open-field maps. More often than not, you will find <strong>multiple paths</strong> available to you, each one with a good reason to explore fully.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-everything-is-an-open-field">Not Everything is an Open-Field</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-linear-missions-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Linear missions return in Nioh 3, and they are better than ever</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not everything is an open field in <em>Nioh 3</em>, though their <strong>design philosophy</strong> permeates the game's entire level design. The locations where main and sub-missions take place are more in line with what was seen in the first two entries in the series, but they are <strong>much more open</strong>, featuring multiple paths to the goal and optional challenges such as stronger Yokai, traps, and more.</p>



<p>These elements are brought to eleven <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">in the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Crucibles</strong>, the hellish landscapes that constit</span>ute&nbsp;the game's main dungeons. Sporting a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">multilayered design</strong> with some platforming sprinkled it, these locations also offer an increased challenge with the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Life Corrosio</strong><strong>n</strong> mechanics, which cause a reduction of your maximum health when attacked by enemies. These effects can be offset by the Jizo Statues' blessings obtained while exploring the open fields, adding another element that ties into the game's big gameplay features.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> also offers something to those who preferred how previous games handled mission selection via <strong>Battle Scrolls</strong>. <span>Unlocke</span>d after completing select missions, these additional missions are accessed straight from the Shrine to offer some of the&nbsp;<strong>most challenging content of the game</strong>, including some intense boss rush-style missions that are very difficult to complete without proper preparation and a good grasp of the game's mechanics.</p>



<p>The inclusion of Battle Scroll missions also increases the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">amount of content</strong>, which would be staggering already with just what can be found in the open-field maps. Although there's only a few of them, they are packed with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">activities and meaningful rewards</strong>. To make an example, it took me nearly 30 hours to explore a good portion of the Warring States map, and I didn't even complete every Myth sidequests nor find every item and point of interest. So no worries about a lack of content: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> is as huge as its predecessors, if not even more so.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-samurai-or-ninja-why-not-both">Samurai or Ninja? Why Not Both?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Samurai-or-Ninja-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 features the ultimate evolution of the series' combat mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The gameplay changes over past entries in the series featured in Nioh 3 don't stop at the introduction of these well-crafted open fields, but extend to the one element that defines a Team NINJA action game: <strong>combat</strong>.</p>



<p>The <strong>combat basics haven't changed much</strong>, on the surface. You still get multiple weapons with unique movesets that can be wielded in three different stances and Ki Pulse to restore your stamina by pressing a specific button at the right time after completing a technique.</p>



<p>Appearances, however, can be very deceiving, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">little has truly remained the same over <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em></strong>. The biggest addition to the combat system is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">two fighting styles</strong>: Samurai and Ninja. Samurai style is essentially the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">classic <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh</em> combat st</strong>yle with the traditional elements outlined above, an Arts Proficiency mechanic that empowers Strong Attacks and Martial Arts, the special techniques performed with button combinations, whose effects can be renewed by stringing these techniques one after the other, and Deflect, a beneficial parry and the core defense mechanic of the fighting style.</p>



<p>Ninja style, on the other hand, is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">mobile fighting style</strong> coming with a single stance but the ability to use Ninjutsu techniques, many of them brought over from Nioh 2, with the difference that their uses can be restored by attacking enemies, blocking, and dodging their attacks. Besides this, what sets Ninja style apart is its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">inability to use Ki Pulse</strong>, which is replaced by a Mist maneuver that can be used to dodge attacks. Both styles can also jump and attack from the air, but Ninja style has the edge in this regard, with more varied aerial Martial Arts, and the ability to jump off enemies for increased airborne time.</p>



<p>Besides the different techniques at their disposal, Samurai and Ninja styles differ the most in their <strong>weapon selection</strong>. While there are Samurai and Ninja style equivalents of the same weapons, such as Swords, Dual Swords, and Caestus/Talons, some are entirely exclusive, such as the Switchglaive and the Tonfa.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Samurai-and-Ninja-Styles-Depth-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 doesn't punish you if you stick to one fighting style, but you would be missing out on a lot</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This locking specific weapon types to specific fighting styles, I feel, will remain the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">most controversial</strong> aspect of the game's combat changes. I personally did not mind this, as one of my main weapons in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>, the Tonfa, works as it always had, but for other weapons, the changes are big, and it's undeniable that the <strong>Kusarigama and the Splitstaff do feel a little gutted</strong> compared to their Nioh 2 iterations.</p>



<p>The existence of the Samurai and Ninja styles, <span>like the weapon mechanics, doesn't feel&nbsp;<strong>limiting</strong>&nbsp;at all, except in</span> some specific cases. In no way whatsoever the game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">forces you to switch between them</strong> like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Stranger of Paradise</em> incentivizes to switch between Jobs on the fly: if you so wish, you could play the entire game in either style and, after defeating a certain boss in the Warring States map, you won't even need to switch to unleash Burst Counter, a very effective counter against the red aura-coded Burst Attacks.</p>



<p>However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sticking to one style only</strong> is definitely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not the optimal way</strong> to play <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, as the two styles' unique capabilities are so tightly interwoven that there will come a point when s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tyle switching will become a core strategy</strong>, also thanks to some Skills which grant you some very nice bonuses for doing so near enemies, including powering up Martial Arts and restoring some Ki when critically low.</p>



<p>The Samurai and Ninja styles are further enhanced by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Living Artifact</strong>, a powered-up temporary state that mixes Living Weapon from the original Nioh and Yokai Shift from its sequel. This not only grants Takechiyo invincibility and elemental properties to their attacks, but also some new techniques which are perfectly woven into every weapon's moveset and the unique abilities of each fighting style.</p>



<p>For every intent and purpose, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the increased freedom offered by the open-field maps seems to have been replicated in the combat system</strong> (whose intricacies are explained in the guides in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/nioh-3-complete-walktrough-and-guides-hub/"><strong>Nioh 3 Walkthrough and Guides Hub</strong></a>). These changes not only make combat even deeper, but also move the experience closer to the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninja Gaiden</em> roots of Team NINJA, turning <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> into a game that's closer to a character action game than a soulslike, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">matching combat depth and quality map traversal as few other action RPGs do.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-the-growth-of-the-shogun">The Growth of the Shogun</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Shogun-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The series' deep character customization returns in Nioh 3</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides being able to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fully customize</strong> Takechiyo Tokugawa at the beginning of the game with a new iteration of Team NINJA's solid character creation system, you have almost complete control of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how to build your protagonist</strong>. You can allocate points to stats at bonfire-like Shrines after obtaining enough Amrita to level up, influencing everything from weapon damage to Ninjutsu potency, and mix and match every piece of equippable gear to further refine the character build with their passive abilities.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Onmyo Magic</strong> abilities, unleashed by using Talismans that have always been a core part of character building in the series, have been radically changed in Nioh 2 and fully integrated into the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Soul Cores system</strong>. These cores dropped by enemies upon defeat can be equipped in the Onmyo Box in either Yin or Yang position to gain access to multiple passive skills, Yokai summoning Talismans, which were the Yokai Skills in <em>Nioh 2</em>, but without the same combo potential or the traditional Onmyo Magic Talismans.</p>



<p>Alongside the split of exclusive style weapons, <strong>the changes to Onmyo Magic</strong>, and the removal of the dedicated skill tree are among <strong>the most controversial changes</strong> to the series' systems in <em>Nioh 3</em>, as most of the community felt the magic-focused playstyle was getting <strong>sidelined</strong>. In some ways, this is true: Onmyo is still effective for buffing and for fighting enemies with elemental spells, but it's undeniable that <strong>introducing a hard limit to how many spells you can carry limits this playstyle</strong>. I do feel this was inevitable with the more action-oriented philosophy in which combat is now grounded, but it will inevitably disappoint those who played as Onmyo Mages.</p>



<p>What did disappoint me more, on the other hand, was the changes made to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yokai Skills system</strong>, replaced by two set Guardian Spirit skills for each spirit, which work essentially in the same way as emergency animation recovery canceling and elemental ailments procurement. Make no mistake: these skills are quite varied and fun to use, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">they lack the same versatility as Yokai Skills</strong>. The new system still lets you use them in some form, but the time required for the skill to activate makes them unsuited for the same intense combo play possible in Nioh 2, even with a specific skill learned fairly early on, which lets you cancel any animation with a Yokai summon. Farewell, Ippon-Datara stun combos, see you in my next <em>Nioh 2</em> playthrough on who knows when.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Nurikabe-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You can still fight powerful Yokai using Onmyo Magic, but the changes made to the system limit its potential</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Don't let my disappointment for losing some of the crazy combos that could be pulled off in <em>Nioh 2</em> with Yokai Skills fool you. Though maybe <strong>less creative</strong> (at least until I figure out how to use the new version of the Yokai Skills properly), <em>Nioh 3</em> still has a lot to offer in this regard. Martial Arts are way <strong>easier to chain into one another</strong> in both Samurai and Ninja style, so it's still possible to pull off some stunning strings with some practice, which is likely due, again, to the changes made to combat as a whole.</p>



<p>Much like Onmyo Magic, however, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Martial Arts underwent a significant change</strong> in Nioh 3, and one that disappointed me.

Such a closed system, however, <strong>doesn't make up for the loss</strong> of a complex system that probably only the most die-hard Nioh players used to its full potential.</p>



<p>Small personal disappointment aside, although streamlined in places, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> character progression systems don't leave much to be desired</strong>. Obviously, their full potential remains to be seen, but as things stand, the depth has only been moved around to better suit <em>Nioh 3</em> combat.</p>



<h2 id="h-wrath-of-the-yokai">Wrath of the Yokai</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Enemy-Design-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3's enemy design is in line with the rest of the series, featuring both new and returning enemies</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With so many tools in the hands of the player, it stands to reason that enemy design would take this into account. However, this seems to hold true only for new enemies.</p>



<p>As expected, <span>given its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;features many&nbsp;<strong>returning human enemies and Yokai</strong>, with some new variations equipped with</span> new weapons and using different attacks. The vast majority of returning enemies and bosses haven't changed much since previous entries, so if you’ve already <strong>mastered their patterns</strong>, you’ll likely find yourself taking them down with muscle memory alone.</p>



<p>The new enemy and bosses, on the other hand, seem to have been designed with the new mechanics in mind. For example, a good number of new Yokai have a <strong>very easy time hitting you out of the air</strong>, forcing you to pay attention before launching in an aerial combo that might be interrupted.</p>



<p>The new <strong>boss design</strong> is, as expected from Team NINJA, very good. Without spoiling anything, some of the bosses Takechiyo will face in their journey through time are all very unique and come with very personable fighting styles and gimmicks that will put your skills to the test, but <strong>never in a frustrating manner</strong>. In the past few years, I couldn't help but start to dislike FromSoftware's boss design philosophies, starting from base <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a></em>, with most bosses unleashing wide range attacks that are difficult to avoid, and <strong>I'm happy that Team NINJA isn't following suit</strong>, preferring to further evolve their tough-but-fair design philosophy.</p>



<p>This is something I appreciated not only in boss fights but also in the <strong>general balancing approach</strong>. This time around, the <strong>difficulty curve is different</strong>. <em>Nioh</em> and <em>Nioh 2</em> were difficult at the beginning, but much easier once you learned how to take advantage of the mechanics to destroy enemies and even stun-lock every boss with the right setup. In <em>Nioh 3</em>, the curve is more natural, <strong>increasing consistently with each new region and map</strong>. Also, enemies don't stay out of Ki for too long, so touch of death combos require overpowered builds that are hardly possible in the first playthrough.</p>



<p>Although s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ome veterans will inevitably be disappointed by what may feel like an easier game</strong>, especially in the Warring States first few regions, I feel this difficulty curve <strong>benefits the game</strong> both in single player and in co-op in the first playthrough, leaving any possible frustration for the higher difficulties that are sure to come with the DLC expansions in the future, in proper Team NINJA fashion.</p>



<h2 id="h-graphics-and-performance">Graphics and Performance</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Graphics-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Nioh 3 is not the best-looking game of the generation, but it's not the worst either</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Team NINJA has always delivered on gameplay, <strong>their latest efforts have left something to be desired in the visuals</strong>. On this front, <em>Nioh 3</em> definitely fares better than, say, <em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, but it's still far from sporting the best visuals of the current generation.</p>



<p>Still, this doesn't mean that the game looks bad. The contrary, actually: it is definitely <strong>one of the most visually advanced games from the studio yet</strong>. Character models are a definite step up from previous games in terms of model complexity and detail, and this is easily noticeable with the returning Yokai, whose looks are improved over their previous iterations. Animations have also been improved, subtly but sensibly, making combat feel even more satisfying. The texture work has similarly been improved, building upon what was seen in <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.</em></p>

<p>Considering how Team NINJA games have often left s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">omething to be desired with their PC ports</strong>, there was some justified concern regarding <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> as well. Unfortunately, the new entry in the series is no different, and the full version is plagued by the same issues many have reported in the demo. <strong>High CPU usage</strong> in certain parts of the open fields, <strong>VRAM usage</strong> increasing for no reason during gameplay, and stuttery camera movement are only the tip of the iceberg</p>



<p>One <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">major technical issue</strong>, aside from the low graphics settings generally looking terrible and the inability to run the game at native resolution without being forced to use NVIDIA DLSS (DLAA), AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS, significantly impacts the experience. This issue has forced me <span>to</span>&nbsp;cap<strong> my FPS at 60</strong> for the best responsiveness in open-field areas.</p>



<p>The issue occurs when Dynamic FPS Adjustment is disabled with a 120 FPS cap. No matter the location, the tools report frame rates in the 100s, but <strong>the entire game is significantly slowed down</strong>. I tried changing every setting, reducing resolution scaling, and even dropping resolution from 4K to 1440p, but the issue persisted. If it is turned on, it automatically caps the framerate to 60 FPS. The only way I had to have the game run at the 120 FPS cap was by enabling Frame Generation, but then again, the experience wasn't as responsive as it is in other games, as the base framerate is stuck at 60 FPS and not at the higher range my system (i7-13700 CPU, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM) can hit in the game.</p>

<p>I had a similar issue a few years ago with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</em> at launch (and on another system to boot!), so this is definitely an engine-level bug that needs to be sorted. However, after a few hours of adjustments, I have found the game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sticks to its 60 FPS cap most of the time</strong> on my system, aside from the occasional stuttering, so if you are really looking forward to the game and don't mind this issue too much, you can still have a great time until it is fixed.</p>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Closing-Thoughts-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Everything considered, is Nioh 3 a step forward for the series?</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The more I played <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, the more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">I liked what Team NINJA has done</strong>. However, the fact that I wasn't having too much trouble against humans and Yokai, for the most part, was something <span>I<strong>&nbsp;couldn't</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> easily put to the side</strong>. Is the game too easy? Have the RPG mechanics been simplified so much that anyone could have the same experience <span>I did, or am I so accustomed to&nbsp;<em>Nioh</em>&nbsp;and Team NINJA games that I have a distorted</span> perception of the game's difficulty?</p>



<p>This, alongside the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">technical bug which forced a 60 FPS cap to me</strong>, made me <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">wrestle with the score for a long time</strong>. I have no doubt that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> is the best game Team NINJA has ever put out - their true <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Elden Ring </em>moment. However, a game of this caliber <strong>deserves</strong> <strong>a PC port that doesn't feel like it's fighting the player's hardware</strong>. While <strong>the game itself is a 10</strong>, the technical issues hold the overall package back just a hair from that perfect mark. But make no mistake: <strong>this is the new gold standard for hardcore action RPGs</strong>.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution. By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design.</p>
