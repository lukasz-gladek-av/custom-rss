			<p>11 bit studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has revealed</a> its new revised roadmap for Frostpunk 2, a game that was released in September last year. Since it was released, it has been a huge success, with the developers saying that it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/">profitable three days</a> after its release, with sales topping 350,000 by that point. Since then, the team has been hard at work on updating the game, adding improvements and fixes to the game, while working on some of the upcoming major updates that would be added.</p>
<p>11 bit studios did initially release a roadmap in November, where it was announced that there would be a free update, as well as console ports in the future. Since then, the studio has released a revised roadmap, which can be seen on Steam. In the roadmap, those interested can get a more accurate timeline as to when the updates and ports will be added to the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>First and foremost, the free major content update will be released on May 8. The text that announces it reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>A day to be remembered: a&nbsp;<strong>Free Major Content Update</strong> that will adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first new Londoners.</em></p>
<p>After the first major update is released for Frostpunk 2, those on consoles can expect to get their hands on the game after waiting just under a year for it. It doesn't have a set release date for console, but the developers have stated that Frostpunk 2 is set to release on console in the Summer. It's set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but there is no mention of the game being ported to last-gen consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. Whether it will be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 when that console releases remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Aside from the free content update and the port of the game to consoles, Frostpunk 2 has a major lineup for 2025 at the very least. The Spectrum DLC is set to release in the Fall, and the developers have left the cryptic message with it that it will "help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one."</p>
<p>After the Spectrum DLC, the Aurora DLC is also slated to release this year, but depending on how the development and porting goes of the first three major highlights of the roadmap, it may end up pushed into 2026.</p>
<p>Looking into next year, there is a third DLC planned for Frostpunk 2, adding even more content to the game. It's not said yet what is planned for either the Aurora DLC or the third DLC, but more information is bound to be released by 11 bit studios in the future.</p>
