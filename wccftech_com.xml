			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, packing a lot of fixes and improvements that should improve emulation considerably.</p>
<p>As confirmed on the emulator's <a href="https://shadps4.net/index.php/2024/10/31/shadps4-v0-4-0-just-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, version 0.4.0 features plenty of fixes and improvements that enable proper emulation of select titles, such as Gravity Rush Remastered, which previously only worked with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/">workarounds</a>. Among the fixes and improvements are shader recompiler fixes, emulated support for CPUs that don't have SSE4.2a, an auto-update feature, swap chain recreation and window resizing, improved keyboard navigation in the game list, working touchpad support, multiple install folders, improved Vulkan support and more.</p>
<p>While there are a few PlayStation 4 exclusives that the ShadPS4 emulator has made playable on PC, such as the aforementioned Gravity Rush Remastered, most players have been keeping an eye on the best PlayStation 4 emulator currently available to see how well it can run Bloodborne. Thanks to the emulator development team and many modders, the game developed by FromSoftware can be played on PC with a variety of improvements and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-loading-speeds-shad-ps4/">blazing fast load speeds</a>, and players will soon be able to enjoy better visuals thanks to an <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-visuals/">unofficial remaster</a> that is currently in the works which will offer something more beyond the higher resolution and 60FPS gameplay made possible by the emulator.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is setting out to be an extremely demanding game on PC, as even recent mid-range GPUs struggle to run the game at the most common resolution.</p>
<p>As highlighted by a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, the game's open beta, which is finally live on all platforms, struggles to run at 60 FPS at native 1080p resolution on an RTX 4070 GPU at the highest settings, often dipping in the 50s and 40s range on the field. With NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation, things obviously fare much better, as the open beta runs at higher than 60 FPS at both 1440p and 1080p resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds | RTX 4070 4K, 1440p, 1080p DLSS 3.7 Frame Generation | PC Performance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFgPHa8C6-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While there's still some time left until release, and things could change in the final release, it's somewhat worrying to see the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta struggle to run at 60 FPS at native 1080p resolution on a mid-range GPU, although that was somewhat expected, given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-out-now-ssd-required-directstorage-supported-frame-generation-listed-as-recommended/">system requirements</a> and Frame Generation being recommended to hit 60 FPS. Hopefully, the Japanese developer will use the next few months to improve things and make the run better on a wider range of system configurations.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game.1024980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched only a few hours ago,&nbsp;<span>but in this short timeframe, the game has already managed to break some Steam records. Firstly, it has&nbsp;<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1845910/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a concurrent player peak record for a BioWare game with 70.</span>K players. The previous best was Mass Effect Legendary Edition, which launched in May 2021 and included the full remastered trilogy of the sci-fi franchise; its Steam peak was 59.8K concurrent players.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that for several years, EA did not release its games on Steam to favor its own store and app (first Origin, then EA app). For example, Anthem was never launched on Steam, as EA only <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-is-back-on-steam-with-ea-games-and-ea-access-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverted</a> this policy several months after the third-person cooperative shooter launched. By that time, the game had already failed.</p>
<p>While Anthem quickly faded, it did attract considerable interest at first due to the hype. For example, it topped PS4's digital chart for that month. It is reasonable to assume it could have achieved bigger numbers on Steam had it been released right away on Valve's platform.</p>
<p>Still, even with those caveats, Dragon Age: The Veilguard also became the single player game with the highest concurrent player peak published by Electronic Arts, beating Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which stopped at 67.8K players. There's another little caveat here: The Sims 4 is also a single player title, and it peaked at 96.3K players on Steam, but it is a free-to-play game.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard could still surpass The Sims 4 wholesale during the weekend, when concurrent player records are usually established. Anyway, user reception also appears to be largely favorable, with 79% of the 3,610 user reviews already submitted rating it positively.</p>
<p>Granted, we'll have to wait a bit longer to see a larger picture of the game's sales. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> confidence in the game's breakout potential.</p>
<p>In my review of the game, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPG with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>

			<p>EA and Respawn Entertainment have <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced on the official EA website</a> that they are shifting away from Linux support for Apex Legends. This means that those using a Steam Deck will no longer be able to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-lootboxes-get-official-drop-rate-disclosure-from-ea/">the game</a>, as the Steam Deck runs Linux OS. This move likely comes as a shock to many, as games such as these are quite popular to play on handheld consoles. However, EA mentions that they are dropping support for Linux OS in an attempt to maintain "competitive integrity" and to fight off cheaters. This isn't the only game to drop Steam Deck support, as Grand Theft Auto V also went from being the most played game on the Steam Deck to unsupported due to Rockstar Games adding an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/">anti-cheat</a> that is unsupported on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This announcement made by EA and Respawn Entertainment says: "In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game."</p>
<p>It's a well-known fact that there are ways to modify the Steam Deck, and adding ways to cheat in a game seems to be no different. People have managed to get Blizzard games running on their Steam Deck, as well as emulated Nintendo games. The handheld seems to have no bounds, as long as the person knows what they're doing.</p>
<p>EA has mentioned that Linux is an "attractive" OS for those who want to cheat in the game. This comes after they looked into the number of legitimate players using Linux against those who are cheating and utilizing Linux. It's not known how many are using Linux to cheat, but EA and Respawn Entertainment are willing to take the risk in doing so.</p>
<p>By default, it means that the Steam Deck will be unsupported, as there is "currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux.)" However, people have managed to install Windows on their Steam Deck. In doing so, this means that those using it will be able to continue playing Apex Legends on their handheld. Whether they will change this decision in the future will depend on how successful they are in stamping out cheaters by limiting Linux users.</p>
