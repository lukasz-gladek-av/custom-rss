			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/rockstar-early-access-fan-gta-6/">Tech4Gamers</a>, a terminally ill <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> fan seems to have been given the chance to play <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong> ahead of its release. It's the second time in the span of two years that <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> is giving a dying fan a chance to play an unreleased title before they are no longer able to. </p>



<p>The last time this happened, the game in question was <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>, with longtime fan <strong>Caleb McAlpine</strong> posting his story to Reddit, on a wing and a prayer, hoping that his plea to try and play Borderlands 4 before he passed would make it to Gearbox. It did, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-flew-terminally-ill-fan-to-its-studio-to-play-borderlands-4-early-i-am-praying-he-makes-to-when-we-are-done">Gearbox flew Caleb and a friend of his to their home studio on first-class plane tickets</a> to tour the studio and play Borderlands 4 a year ahead of release.</p>



<p>This time, the story doesn't begin with a post on Reddit, but in now-deleted posts on LinkedIn from a UI integrator at Ubisoft Toronto, <strong>Anthony Armstrong</strong>. Armstrong made a call out to any potential connections he had at Rockstar and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Rockstar Toronto</a></strong> to ask if there was any chance a member of his family who had approximately 6 months to a year left to live could play the highly anticipated game ahead of its release.</p>

<p>According to the post, which you can see above, this story has a happy ending with Armstrong seemingly speaking to the right people, with a report from <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/gta-6-terminally-ill-fan-play-early/">TheGamer</a> adding that Armstrong was contacted by Take-Two boss, <strong>Strauss Zelnick</strong>, as part of the process to set up a private play session for their relative. </p>



<p>It's perhaps the happiest story to come out of Rockstar recently, as news around the studio has mostly circled around topics like <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">allegations of <strong>union-busting</strong> from the IWGB and the current ongoing legal battle between Rockstar and the IWGB union</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">the state of GTA VI's development, and whether it'll actually still arrive in 2026</a>. On top of Rockstar trying to put out metaphorical fires, it also had a real one to deal with today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-north-fire-explosion-grand-theft-auto-vi/">after an explosion caused by a malfunctioning heating boiler started a fire at the Rockstar North offices in Edinburgh</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll eventually get a follow-up to this story as we did with Caleb McAlpine's. Wccftech has attempted to reach out to Mr. Armstrong for such a follow-up and will update this story if/when we hear back.</p>

			<p>Although life continues to be grim for fans of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls</em></strong> series, as the wait for the sixth entry in the series gets more difficult to bear with each passing day, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025</strong> brought a smile to more than a few of them with the release of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>, a remake of the fourth entry in the series by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> powered by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unreal Engine 5</strong> which leaves the original gameplay almost intact.</p>



<p>Right from the outset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"><strong>the game's shadowdrop appeared successful</strong></a>, which wasn't surprising given how popular the game remained following its 2006 release. However, nostalgia is not as powerful as some may think for engagement, as many players got their fix in about 10 hours before dropping the game.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/how-2025s-xbox-published-games-sold"><strong>a new report</strong></a> shared a couple of days <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ago,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong>&nbsp;looked at how well&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox-published</strong>&nbsp;games performed</span> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong>, starting with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>. The remake sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1.1 million copies</strong> on the system, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"proving the pull of Bethesda’s legacy catalogue on PlayStation hardware,"</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Elliot</strong> wrote in the Substack post. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Over 80% of Oblivion’s PS5 copies were sold during its first month on the market, but some discounts to $33 over the past couple of months have led to small sales spikes,"</em> the analyst added.</p>



<p>While sales were solid, player engagement wasn't impressive at all for a massive RPG, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"around half of Oblivion Remastered players on PS5 played for less than 15 hours, showing that most people got their nostalgia fix before meaningfully progressing."</em> Considering how easy it is to lose oneself in Cyrondiil before making any real progress in the main story, this highlights that a remake needs more than improved visuals to keep players engaged past the point where they get their nostalgia fix.</p>



<p>However, there could be a few more reasons why those who purchased <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong> did not play for long, besides the lack of new content. For starters, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">the game still runs poorly across all formats</a></strong>, and the performance hiccups make it challenging to enjoy the new visuals. In addition, the game does not support <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-8k-texture-packs/">mods</a></strong> on consoles, preventing it from achieving the same enduring popularity as its sequel, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Skyrim</em></strong>.</p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> selling reasonably well, regardless of how long players have lost themselves in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyrodiil</strong>, it will be interesting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em></strong> will fare on the system. While the latest <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RPG</strong> by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> is far from being as popular as previous games from the studio, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong> believes it will outperform the remake developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Virtuos</strong>. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/"><strong>the rumored 2.0 update</strong></a> will also provide reasons for jaded players like me to return to the game, whose opinion on it<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/"><strong> soured a lot in the months after its release.</strong></a></p>
