			<p>The development team behind Battlefield 6, collectively known as Battlefield Studios (DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a detailed update</a> on how their kernel-level Javelin anti-cheat system has been performing in combating cheats in the popular first-person military shooter game.</p>



<p>According to data gathered by the developers, Javelin ensured that roughly 98% of online Battlefield 6 matches in the game's launch week were effectively cheat-free. This means there was only a 2% 'Match Infection Rate', an admittedly nebulous data point that the developers describe as the chance that players would encounter a cheater in their matches. </p>



<p>The 98% rate was attributed mainly to the improvements made during the Open Beta weekend. At first, 'only' 93.1% of the matches were cheat-free, but that figure was raised to almost 98% by the final day after blocking over 1.2 million cheat attempts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing tens of thousands of cheaters</a>. Secure Boot adoption had increased from 62.5% to 92.5%, as well.</p>



<p>During the launch weekend of Battlefield 6, Javelin prevented over 367K cheating attempts. That's fewer than during comparable Open Beta weekends, but it's consistent with the current number of cheating developers the developers had tracking. To date, this figure has grown to 2.39 million blocked cheat attempts. Battlefield Studios is currently aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, resellers, and their associated communities. Since launch, 183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely.</p>



<p>That doesn't mean the fight against Battlefield 6 cheats is over. Beyond the requirement of Secure Boot, developers are exploring additional features already available at the operating system level, such as HVCI (Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity) and VBS (Virtualization-Based Security). Furthermore, they will continue to work with console partners to ban cheating hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as the Cronus Zen</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 just ended <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its free multiplayer trial event</a>. The game is about to receive its Winter Offensive update in a week. Winter Offensive will add a new map, mode and weapon; players will roam the streets of Brooklyn with below freezing temperatures, forced to seek Heat Zones to prevent health drain in the limited-time Ice Lock event, battle other teams in the limited-time Ice Lock Gauntlet variant, and unlock the new Ice Climbing Melee Axe.</p>

			<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination has just received a new update, introducing none other than rap icon and GRAMMY and Academy Award winner Eminem as the latest limited-time Elusive Target mission, available in the game from now through December 31st. This mission is available globally for free starting today as part of the Free Starter Pack, so everyone can get a shot at killing the Slim Shady for good.</p>



<p>As part of an interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a> on this update, HITMAN developer IO Interactive practically confirmed that a new game will come at some point, despite the studio currently being busy with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-confirms-long-rumored-online-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unnamed online fantasy roleplaying game</a>. CEO Hakan Abrak said:</p>



<p><em>Of course there will be more HITMAN, but right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year, and next year you’ll get more news about co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next HITMAN.</em></p>



<p>It appears that the hiatus IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-is-on-hiatus-while-ioi-makes-project-007-and-project-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placed their beloved IP in two and a half years ago</a> has officially come to an end.</p>



<p>In the Variety interview, Abrak also added that 007 is really the only external franchise that IO Interactive would work on, as it fits with their expertise so well:</p>



<p><em>We’ve created other original IPs from the ground up — Bond is actually the only external, licensed IP that we’re working on. And I would say that’s probably the only IP we will work on externally that is not ours. Somehow, it kind of made sense after 25 years of rehearsing for the agent fantasy and doing 007. That was a match made in heaven, you could say. But there’s no doubt HITMAN has been our flagship game, our long love for all the time IO Interactive has existed.</em></p>

<p>007 First Light is scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 27, 2026</a>. Long-time HITMAN fans should, however, know that the studio's next game will be a bit more linear, with clear inspiration from the likes of Naughty Dog's Uncharted.

			<p>It's been nearly four years since Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the rumors and officially announced they were working on a Splinter Cell remake. The following day, the publisher also <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-helmed-farcry-6-lead-game-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> some of the key members of the project's development team, including its Game Director, David Grivel.</p>



<p>Grivel, an industry veteran, was the Game Designer of Crysis 2 before moving to Ubisoft, where he worked on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, Assassin's Creed Unity, and, more recently, on two Far Cry games: the prehistoric spin-off (Primal) and the latest mainline installment (Far Cry 6).</p>



<p>Grivel didn't last long in the role, initially leaving in October 2022 to join DICE as Senior Design Director for Battlefield 6. He then briefly returned to Ubisoft Toronto in May 2024 as Game Director for an unannounced project in the concept phase, but left again in December 2024 to join Mac Walters at <a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Untold</a>. This new NetEase-funded developer was, however, quickly shut down when NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled its support in late 2024</a>. </p>



<p>This year, David Grivel worked as a remote consultant on the upcoming cyberpunk action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-action-rpg-neo-berlin-2087-new-gamescom-2025-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEO BERLIN 2087</a>. However, last week, he announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7397680267999686656/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;that he had&nbsp;rejoined the Splinter Cell remake project, once again as its Game Director.</p>



<p>Supposedly, he'll help bring the project over the finishing line. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier rumors</a>, Ubisoft should be targeting a 2026 launch for the Snowdrop Engine-powered remake. The same source, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that he saw the game and that it looked impressive. </p>



<p>We don't really know much about the game's details. A job description <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-rewritten-updated-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Ubisoft was looking to 'rewrite and update' the story for a modern audience, although it is unclear whether that direction was maintained amidst the shuffling of directors.</p>



<p>Still, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful return of Solid Snake with the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3</a>, fans of stealth action games will definitely be happy to see his old frenemy Sam Fisher coming back, too. Moreover, the Splinter Cell Remake could be the third big remake of a classic Ubisoft title to launch in 2026, following Prince of Persia: Sands of Time (<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly due next month</a>) and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly set for a March 2026 release</a>).</p>
