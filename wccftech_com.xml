			<p>Among the most impressive aspects of the PlayStation 5 Pro is its ability to deliver much better performance than the base model while consuming similar power.</p>
<p>As part of their in-depth testing of the recently released console by Sony, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDp1C_4AD4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> tested the PlayStation 5 Pro power consumption running different games, including Elden Ring, which was not patched to take advantage of the system's unique features, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which did receive a PS5 Pro patch. In both games, the mid-generation refresh in Quality Mode consumed as much as the PlayStation 5 Slim while delivering much better performance and image quality, although the Slim console used for the test may have had some issues, as it was consuming more power than expected. Still, even compared to the base launch model, the new console's efficiency is very impressive, consuming around the same power to deliver significant improvements in both patched and unpatched. Additionally, this is highly indicative that the two systems' SoCs were produced using different process nodes, likely 4nm for the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>

<p>Despite its high price, the PlayStation 5 Pro is definitely a worthy purchase for those looking to experience PS5 games at their very best. In games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the system delivers significant improvements that enhance the experience considerably. The system is also delivering great 8K modes, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky 8K mode</a>, which is so good that it could start to change minds regarding the viability of such a high resolution.</p>

			<p>Today marks the twentieth anniversary since the release of VtM - Bloodlines, the beloved first-person roleplaying game set in the World of Darkness. Developed by the short-lived Troika Games, it was designed by some of the minds behind the first two Fallout games and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura: Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Jason Anderson.</p>
<p>The game's development was not at all easy due to milestone delays that eventually brought the project over its intended budget. Publisher Activision ultimately demanded a release candidate to ship the game no matter what, but Troika had only managed to do a few weeks of testing.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this greatly affected the game's polish. VtM - Bloodlines was the quintessential gem in the rough, widely praised for its story, characters, and overall writing, while also being a bug-ridden fest. Despite the overall positive reception (it was rated 80% on Metacritic by critic reviews), sales were heavily disappointing. Following the game's launch, Troika tried to secure funding for its next project which would have marked a return to the creators' post-apocalyptic roots, but was ultimately unsuccessful. The company was forced to lay off its employees in late 2024 and shut down for good on February 24, 2005.</p>
<p>As for VtM - Bloodlines, over time, it became even more of a cult classic, ultimately leading to the development of a sequel (which had even more problems than the original, though). Bloodlines 2 is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> for the first half of 2025, but in the meantime, you can download the freshly released R<a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-remix-toolkit-updated-by-nvidia-with-many-qol-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TX Remix</a> Alpha 0.0.1 mod to celebrate the 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>NVIDIA's remastering tool brings the visuals into 2024 with the power of remastered assets and path tracing, although of course, there are caveats. Only a small portion of the game has been fully remastered, and there are many bugs, which is in keeping with the game's tradition.</p>
<p><em><strong>What's in this release:</strong></em><br>
<em>-The Haven Apartments in Santa Monica. Full texture and model remaster proof of concept!</em><br>
<em>Every prop and texture in the actual apartment rooms themselves, including the players room and adjacent 2 enterable apartments! Though at the 11th hour a few of them stopped displaying correctly...</em></p>
<p><em>99% of models are replaced with from scratch built models and retextured built to the proportions of the original assets.</em></p>
<p><em>99% of Textures inside the pawnshop apartment areas have been retextured using hi poly meshes for initial bakes for shape and normal info, then retextured using Substance Designer and Toolbag 4/5's texturing suite.</em></p>
<p><em>-A rough emissive and lighting pass on the rest of the game</em><br>
<em>VtM: Bloodlines uses the alpha channel as an emissive mask for many textures in the game. I did a rough pass of converting these to emissive maps and applying them to their corresponding textures. So now the things that should light up, should light up. (And some that shouldn't!) These emissive maps will get replaced when I remaster the individual textures fully.</em></p>
<p>Below, you'll find a few comparison screens.</p>
