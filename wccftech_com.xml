			<p>If you have been following tech news <span>over the past few months, you are well aware of how the&nbsp;<strong>widespread adoption of AI</strong>&nbsp;is causing many</span> issues for consumers, with <strong>prices of components</strong> such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ram-prices-are-flattening-out-over-the-past-few-days-but-dont-be-fooled/"><strong>RAM</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sandisk-wd-black-sn7100-sn8100-1-tb-ssds-have-risen-to-246-366/">SSDs</a></strong> <strong>skyrocketing</strong> in a matter of days. </p>



<p>These price increases and the limited availability of components for anything that is not supposed to be used in an AI data center is making things difficult even for console manufacturers, so much so that <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Sony is reportedly actively considering a delay of its PlayStation 6 system.</strong></p>



<p>In a new report posted today on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a></strong>, according to people "<em>familiar</em>" with the company's thinking, <em>"Sony Group Corp. is now considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029."</em></p>



<p> While this isn't the first time we have heard of a possible <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/">delay for the PlayStation 6</a></strong> beyond the expected 2027 release window, the number of reports in the past few weeks suggests <strong>this is no longer a last-case scenario but a concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Things are not any easier for the manufacturers who managed to release their hardware before this <strong>chip crisis</strong> showed its ugly head. According to people familiar with the company's plan who spoke with Bloomberg, Nintendo is also <strong>contemplating raising the price of the Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in 2026. </p>



<p>Again, this isn't very surprising. Back in November, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 price</strong></a> was expected to remain stable in the immediate future unless "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected event</em>." Still, this is an unfortunate turn of events that will eventually <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">price many gamers out of current-generation systems.</strong></p>



<p>The PlayStation 6 may not be the only next-generation console to see a consistent delay over its expected release window. The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">next-generation Xbox may launch in 2027</strong></a>, but that is reportedly a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">best-case scenario</strong></a>, and with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">Magnus APU being more expensive</a></strong> than the chip powering Sony's systems, the system would be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">commercially</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">doomed</strong> if it launched at a very high price that would be in complete contrast to the concept of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">affordability</strong> that makes <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">consoles enticing to consumers.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This weekend, Polish developer <strong>Bloober Team</strong> unveiled <strong>Layers of Fear 3</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pASWkDkyaY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a special event celebrating the horror franchise's 10th anniversary</a>. Bloober Team founder and CEO <strong>Piotr Babieno</strong> appeared to discuss <strong>the great importance of Layers of Fear for the studio</strong>:</p>



<p><em>For Bloober Team, Layers of Fear isn't just a title from our past. It marked the moment when we understood what kind of studio we want to be, what type of games we want to create. Tonight, we want to honor that legacy and show you that Layers of Fear is still alive, still evolving, and still finding new ways to haunt.</em></p>



<p>Then, Creative Director and Lead Designer <strong>Mateusz Lenart</strong> spoke about the philosophy behind these horror games:</p>



<p><em>Layers of Fear was imagined as a tribute to artists and a thin line between inspiration and obsession. Creativity can be both beautiful and destructive while shaped by ambition and the fear of failure. Our goal was to show that by placing the player inside of an artist's unraveling mind, we invite empathy rather than judgment, changing horror into a deeply human experience.</em></p>



<p><em>When we started making the game in 2015, we were a team of around 20 people. It was a very personal project for us, and everyone put their own inspirations and experiences into the game's art style and narrative themes. We are extremely grateful that the game resonated with so many people throughout the years. Layers of Fear is the game for the artist within you. And as every artistic journey, the deeper you go into it, the more you discover about yourself. </em></p>



<p>Babieno then announced that the original soundtrack <strong>will be made available on both CD and vinyl</strong>. Moreover, they unveiled a partnership with <strong>Foksal Publishing Group</strong> to create <strong>novels</strong> based on the Layers of Fear franchise, starting with one written by <strong>Marta Bijan</strong> and scheduled for release in <strong>late 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>However, for gamers, the juiciest announcement came right at the end of the livestream: a teaser for Layers of Fear 3.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's clearly early days still. The studio recently released <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: New Dawn</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is remaking Silent Hill 1</a></strong>, after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doing a great job with Silent Hill 2</a></strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In 2024, after years of seemingly turning a blind eye, <strong>Nintendo</strong> brought the DMCA takedown hammer hard on Switch emulators like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuzu</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryujinx</a></strong>. Despite the significant blow, however, it was far from the end of the Nintendo Switch emulator scene. Ryujinx and Yuzu forks are still available, and brand new emulators like <strong>Eden</strong> and <strong>Citron</strong>, just to name two, have emerged over time. Nintendo's latest big release, <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-runs-well-on-pc-emulators-can-even-be-played-in-stereo-3d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately playable on those Switch emulators</a></strong>.</p>



<p>On Friday, though, the Switch emulator scene suffered another scare as Nintendo <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1r32zz6/comment/o51du26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a new DMCA takedown notice</a></strong> targeting the GitHub pages of most remaining emulators, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Citron</li>



<li>Eden</li>



<li>Kenji-NX</li>



<li>MeloNX</li>



<li>Pine</li>



<li>Pomelo</li>



<li>Ryubing</li>



<li>Ryujinx</li>



<li>Skyline</li>



<li>Sudachi</li>



<li>Sumi</li>



<li>Suyu</li>



<li>Yuzu</li>
</ul>



<p>The Citron website <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears to be dead</a>, and the same goes for <a href="https://melonx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MeloNX</a>. However, many of the other Switch emulators are still normally available, including Eden, currently the most popular one. In Eden's Discord, one of the project managers sent the following message on Friday:</p>



<p><em>Nintendo issued a DMCA takedown request against our Releases repository, hosted at https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases. At the time we're unsure what exactly will happen to that repository (or when anything will happen), but the most likely scenario is that it's removed and you won't be able to access our stable releases on GitHub anymore. Our source code is unaffected, as it isn't hosted on GitHub. The only thing targeted was our GitHub releases page. Not the source code, not our Actions workflow, nothing on our self-hosted Git instance, not even our development PR/Master/Nightly builds. The source code is always available at https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden, and releases are also mirrored at https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden/releases. Our development will continue as always!</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, a new build (v0.2.0-rc1) <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/tag/v0.2.0-rc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was uploaded yesterday to the GitHub Releases page</a>, where downloads are still available. So, I reached out to the project managers to find out what was going on, and they told me <strong>they're fighting the takedown notice</strong> with a proper argument that Eden's repository <strong>does not infringe any laws or GitHub's hosting policies</strong>.</p>



<p>I then asked Eden founder Camille LaVey <span>whether the goal was to continue&nbsp;<strong>even if the DMCA takedown succeeded</strong></span> and removed their GitHub Releases page. Here's his reply:</p>



<p><em>Effectively, as founder of Eden, I can say that we want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware. Since this is a community-driven project, we always look to provide the best result possible for all; yet, we're never sure of what the future can bring, so we're always trying to ask the community to help us in any way they can, so Eden can still be alive for the years to come.</em></p>



<p>We'll keep you posted on what happens to Switch emulators after the latest Nintendo crackdown. Stay tuned.</p>
