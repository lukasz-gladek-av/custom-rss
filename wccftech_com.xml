			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is currently available for players to try in an early access, semi-closed beta form, which is only semi-closed because technically anyone could have acquired a code through specific channels, but only those with a code can jump into the beta today and tomorrow before it opens to the rest of the non-code-having public on August 9-10 and then again next weekend from August 14-17.</p>



<p>And even in that confusing, not entirely closed, yet not entirely open form, hundreds of thousands of players have jumped through every necessary hoop to play Battlefield 6 as soon as possible, with today's kick-off of the beta already seeing concurrent player numbers on Steam alone surpass the all-time high concurrent player count of Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>We expected Battlefield 6's beta numbers to be high, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-servers-already-full-thousands-in-queue/">servers were already starting to fill up yesterday</a>, but no one thought they'd necessarily be this high. Per SteamDB, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1517290/charts/#max">Battlefield 2042's highest concurrent player count</a> on Steam only reached 107,376 players, a mark reached two years after it launched, and beating out its launch concurrent player numbers by about 2,000 players.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 beta, once again according to SteamDB, has already reached a peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/?peak=334549"><strong>334,549</strong> concurrent players</a>. At the time of this writing, there are 303,222 players in the beta on Steam.</p>



<p>It's all a clear sign that there are hundreds of thousands who were hungry for a new Battlefield game that at least looks like it has the chance of capturing the same attention and hold the series once had on the shooter genre.</p>



<p>It's a great start for a game that EA has put so much behind, with four studios all working together on various aspects of Battlefield 6 to ensure that it gets the best chance at being the comeback-kid the series and EA desperately needs it to be.</p>



<p>Of course, the real test will come when the game actually launches later this year in October, and if its launch can not only repeat, but beat these numbers - and then sustain them for longer than a day.</p>



<p>If you're not able to check out the beta this weekend but want to find out more about how Battlefield 6 plays, then you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto's impressions of the game</a>, as Kai got the try it out last week during the multiplayer reveal event EA hosted. </p>
