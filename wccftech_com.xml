			<p>The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann is undoubtedly a very busy person these days. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNtAhRQNfcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Press X to Continue podcast</a>, the acclaimed game designer and writer revealed he is producing an unannounced game.</p>
<p><em>Then, you know, there's another game that's being worked out in Naughty Dog where I'm more of a producer role and I get to mentor and watch this other team and give feedback and be, like, the executive in the room. I enjoy all those roles and the fact that I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I'm never bored.</em></p>
<p>Of course, that is in addition to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which he's personally directing. And he's also an executive producer and episode director on The Last of Us HBO show, which is likely to continue beyond season two, given that it didn't include all of the story from the second game.</p>
<p>Druckmann's statement confirms a recent rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-reportedly-canceled-a-single-player-game-this-year-but-another-unannounced-game-is-still-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by movie insider Daniel Richtman, who mentioned that Naughty Dog recently canceled a game formerly directed by Vinit Agarwal but still has another active project that's been in the works for at least three years with Shaun Escayg as its director.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to what that will be, we inevitably enter guessing territory. The mind immediately goes to The Last of Us Part III, which many fans would like to see at some point. However, Druckmann himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-could-be-it-for-the-last-of-us-says-series-creator-neil-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> just over two months ago that there may not even be a third installment in the beloved franchise. Was he just misdirecting until a proper announcement? Or is Escayg perhaps working on a new installment in the Uncharted IP, which is familiar ground for him, having already co-directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy with Kurt Margenau? It may be a while until we learn the answers to these questions.</p>
<p>During that podcast conversation, Druckmann also marveled at the improvements made in the gaming medium when discussing things that The Last of Us fans preferred in the game over the TV show adaptation:</p>
<p><em>Lately, I've just been really fascinated with the adaptation and all the various reactions to it. And I just had this moment the other day where I was reading something, actually people were critical of some choices that we've made in the show and they were saying like, oh, I like this better in the game and this was more subtle in the game, and I just had this joyous moment of like, look how far games have come that we could have this conversation. You can compare the two and the game can sit side by side with an HBO show and you can have this conversation and even if people are critical of it, I just love it. And then there's people that love it and there's people that love the show better, and they're like, "Oh, these choices were better than the game." And I'm like, "Isn't that fascinating? Look at that."</em></p>
