			<p>Lost Soul Aside, the action-adventure role-playing game that's been in development for a long time by UltiZero Games as part of Sony's China Hero Project, will require a PlayStation Network account on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-models-textures-couldnt-processed-playstation-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PC release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will allow the game to shine, and some of its visual settings and features will scale beyond what was possible on PlayStation 5 with the appropriate hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-is-officially-coming-to-pc-and-the-epic-games-store?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games</a> regarding the game as a whole and its PC release coming next month, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that the lighting rendering has been greatly adjusted for the PC version of the game, addressing one of the most common complaints about the PlayStation 5 release. In addition, the game will feature even richer 3D models and texture resolutions on high-end hardware that couldn't be processed on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC will also feature, as confirmed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/">reveal trailer</a>, NVIDIA DLSS, and VRR support, alongside graphical presets perfect for those who do not want to tinkle with graphics settings too much. Further granular options will also be available, so the PC version of the second entry in the series should have way more options than those offered in the disappointing PC port of Final Fantasy VII Remake.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director also commented on mods, saying that the game won't have official mod support but that the development team welcomes user modifications, except for inappropriate mods, which the director asks modders not to make. Seeing how it went with Final Fantasy XVI, however, Hamaguchi-san shouldn't get his hopes up.</p>
<p>Unlike Final Fantasy XVI, whose additional PC features eventually made their way onto the PS5 release, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will not launch with anything of the sort, although the team did have to resist the urge to add new content. Originally, they wanted to add an episodic story as a new DLC, but ultimately decided that finishing the final game in the trilogy was the highest priority, also considering limited resources. However, if the team receives strong requests from players after the PC release regarding certain matters, most likely including the additional story DLC, they would like to consider them, so there's still the possibility of maybe being able to see Cid or Vincent in action before the launch of the third part of the remake, as was done with Yuffie with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">INTERmission DLC</a>, which turned out great.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5. The game launches on PC on January 23rd.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content.1064112/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As customary at the end of the year, ZeniMax Online Studios boss Matt Firor <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/67321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> a letter about the state of The Elder Scrolls Online, the popular MMORPG that just celebrated its tenth year of live service.</p>
<p>Firor discussed major changes coming to the structure of upcoming content. The team has focused on delivering annual expansions called Chapters ever since 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrowind</a>. They released the eighth this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold Road</a>, which added a new Scribing mechanics that allowed users to tweak skills/spells and three zones in the vicinity of Cyrodiil.</p>
<p>Gold Road will be the last Chapter released for Elder Scrolls Online, though. The team is changing its approach to new content, switching to a seasonal distribution instead. Firor said the Seasons might last anywhere from three to six months, featuring a blend of content like new stories, events, in-game store items, dungeons, and more.</p>
<p>2025 will be a transition year as the team shifts to the new model. As such, players can expect new zone-based content that has been in the works for some time, as well as 'some larger items.' According to the Studio Director of ZeniMax Online Studios, the new approach will allow the team to release more varied content more efficiently.</p>
<p>He actually went on to detail the specific areas of focus where 'experiments' will be conducted and evaluated based on community feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyrodiil performance. ZeniMax Online Studios will be experimenting with a Cyrodiil campaign where all classes will have PvP-specific (and more performant) skills that replace the standard player skills with the expectation that we can support more players per campaign</li>
<li>Increasing the difficulty of standard overworld combat</li>
<li>Improving the overall feel of combat with animation, FX, and potentially audio work</li>
<li>Experimenting with more zones like Craglorn (although not as large in area or scope), created exclusively for high-end group and soft-group content with associated gear chase</li>
<li>Adding and refining tools to make guild recruitment, interaction, and management easier and more logical</li>
</ul>
<p>That's not all, as the development team also wants to improve the experience of new and returning Elder Scrolls Online users alike. Other objectives include a new PC patcher, improving the visuals of base game zones with updated textures and assets (this will begin rolling out next March), enhancing the game's PC UI, and other map and UI systems currently in the design/concept stage.</p>
<p>Overall,</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>The audience</strong></p>
<p>The OXS Thunder Pro + Gaming Soundbar is designed with gamers in mind, offering Dolby Atmos-certified sound in a more compact form than many other soundbars. It supports multiple audio input options, but for the best performance, connecting via HDMI to a PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X will deliver the full Dolby digital audio experience. Additionally, an optional "neck pillow" accessory can be attached to a chair, providing two rear speaker channels for an enhanced audio setup. PC users can also download OXS Audio, a free app that captures screen images to synchronize the soundbar's dynamic in-game RGB lighting effects and also allows users to customize channel volume and equalization settings.</p>
<p><strong>Design and features</strong></p>
<p>While the Thunder Pro + offers a modern design with a slim profile and matte finish, it doesn’t quite fit the typical TV room aesthetic. The soundbar’s design feels more suited to a desktop or PC setup, with its compact size and angled form factor that’s better positioned in front of a computer monitor rather than beneath a television. This gives it a somewhat out-of-place appearance when paired with a larger TV, especially in living rooms where a more traditional, wide-surfaced soundbar would be preferable.</p>
<figure><figcaption>OXS Thunder Pro with blue RGB lighting</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Thunder Pro's plastic construction and front perforated grille give it a more "techy" feel, but it lacks the premium build expected from soundbars designed to seamlessly integrate into a TV setup. As a result, it might feel out of place for console users seeking a more polished, TV-friendly look that blends well with their home entertainment systems.</p>
<p>OXS's offering has excellent connectivity, supporting USB-A, USB-C, Aux, Bluetooth, and HDMI. However, it doesn’t come with the necessary cables, so you'll need to supply your own. The variety of connections is impressive, and being able to switch between them using the remote means you can keep several devices connected simultaneously. In addition, players can also plug in their headset and mic for chatting during gameplay. The only drawback in terms of connectivity is the lack of a separate sub-output.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Connection options on the OXS Thunder Pro</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>The OXS Thunder Pro + soundbar delivers clear and crisp audio, especially when it comes to dialogue and vocals. It's well-suited for watching TV shows, listening to podcasts, and general audio use.</p>
<p>That said, the bass performance falls short of expectations. Despite claims of a deep, punchy low-end, the bass lacks the impact and depth one might anticipate from a high-end sound system. For action-packed games, media, or music with heavy bass, the soundbar doesn't quite deliver the rumble and power that you might expect from a $699.99 gaming sound system.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Thunder Pro woofers on top (also on bottom)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At its high price, the OXS Thunder Pro + may not satisfy those seeking a full, balanced sound. While it does shine in terms of clarity and mid-range performance, the weak bass can make it difficult to justify the premium cost—particularly for those who prioritize a rich, immersive audio experience.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neck speaker</span></strong></p>
<p>The OXS Satellite Neck Speaker accessory stands out for its impressive comfort. Its soft, ergonomic design provides excellent neck support, making it ideal for long gaming sessions. Gamers will appreciate the comfort it adds to their setup, especially for extended playtime.</p>
<p>However, performance-wise, the neck pillow doesn't quite deliver. Though it’s meant to add extra rear channels to enhance the audio experience with the Thunder Pro soundbar, the sound output is surprisingly weak. The added channels don’t provide the powerful, immersive audio expected, leaving the experience feeling underwhelming.</p>
<p>Additionally, the pillow's battery life is a major downside. Despite its innovative features, it drains power quickly, requiring frequent recharges during longer sessions. This high battery consumption can be a hassle, especially for those hoping for a more efficient accessory.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while the OXS Satellite Neck Speaker excels in comfort, its low sound output and high battery usage diminish its overall appeal. It’s a great option for those in need of neck support, but it may not be the best choice for audiophiles or users looking for a more powerful, efficient audio solution.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the OXS Thunder Pro + Gaming Soundbar offers solid performance with clear dialogue and crisp audio, making it a good choice for casual listening and general media consumption. However, its bass performance falls short, lacking the deep, impactful low-end expected from a high-end sound system, especially for gaming or music with heavy bass. Its design is more suited to a PC setup, and the absence of a separate subwoofer further contributes to the lack of a full, balanced sound.</p>
<p>At its premium price, the Thunder Pro + may not fully justify its cost for users seeking a richer, more immersive audio experience.
