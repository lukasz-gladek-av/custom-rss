			<p>Testing on the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started</a> via the BF Labs platform last week, and thanks to YouTube user Tomski, we've already got a 15-minute leaked gameplay video to check out. The first impression isn't exactly great, as this looks too much like Call of Duty's Warzone, according to most fans.  Of course, that may change when they actually get to play it.</p>



<p>One of the defining features of the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode is supposed to be destruction, which has been more or less synonymous with the franchise ever since the release of 2008's Bad Company. Beyond that, the mode retains Battlefield's trademark squad system. Each squad (so far, there's no talk of a solo or even a duo mode) selects its classes before the match, and the chosen class cannot be changed during the match. Players begin with two gadgets from their class and can level up during each match, gaining access to special traits, such as the Assault class being able to equip an armor plate more quickly. Experience is earned by defeating an opposing player or completing missions. Additionally, finding Intel Cases scattered throughout the map will yield experience to the entire squad.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode also features a slight twist on the regular shrinking circle formula, or at least on how it affects players. Whereas most circles slowly damage those players on the outside, allowing for tactics such as sneaking from behind the circle, here the circle will instantly kill every player upon contact, therefore eliminating such strategies.</p>



<p>The rest is fairly standard fare for the genre. Squads will be randomly assigned missions that can provide powerful rewards, but players must always be on the lookout because those rewards will be air-dropped in and could technically be stolen by other squads. </p>



<p>There's no word or even rumor on when the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode will be released. It will likely depend on this testing phase; given that it will miss the main game's launch (slated for October 10) anyway, it doesn't make sense to rush it before it's ready and the players have provided their own feedback. </p>

			<p>The rumors surrounding Insomniac's Marvel's Wolverine game are heating up. Earlier this month, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-insomniac-worlverine-playstation-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a State of Play could show off gameplay for the first time later this month. Last week, Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-looking-fantastic-according-playtesters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that he learned the game is being extremely well-received by internal playtesters, and a trailer is just about ready, although it might be shown off at The Game Awards in December instead of the aforementioned State of Play.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marvels-wolverine-aims-2026-release-venom-project-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st</a>, through its anonymous sources, is assuring fans that Marvel's Wolverine is very much on track to be released next year. The report did not add anything else about the upcoming debut of the Canadian mutant; however, it does shed some new light on Insomniac's other project: <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-venom-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venom</a>.</p>



<p>Firstly, MP1st says the game is very much in development. Much like Marvel's Wolverine, Venom was the subject of Insomniac's leak, and there were fears that the project might have been paused or even canceled. MP1st's sources add that Eddie Brock should be the host of the alien symbiote this time around, after what happened in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, where Peter Parker and later Harry Osborn were its hosts. According to the report, Brock should be portrayed more closely to the comic book character than Venom's live action film trilogy (where actor Tom Hardy played Brock).</p>



<p>Insomniac's Venom game would also see the return of Carnage. Players glimpsed this in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, when Cletus Kasady, the leader of the Crimson Hour cult, leaves Peter Parker and Yuri Watanabe with the following words: <em>'And when the Crimson Hour rolls over this Earth, it shall bring truth, judgement, and carnage.'</em> </p>



<p>Of course, seeing Carnage in a Venom game makes perfect sense, since the two are closely related (in general Marvel lore, Carnage is Venom's darker, more powerful and destructive offspring). It should be noted that while Insomniac and Sony confirmed Marvel's Wolverine a long time ago, no such confirmation ever came for Carnage. The leaks confirmed its existence, but as always, we'll have to wait for an official reveal to be sure.</p>
