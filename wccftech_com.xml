			<p>Brass Rain is an upcoming free-to-play WWII first-person shooter from Yarnhub Studios, a developer made up of veterans from EA, Remedy, Sony, and Jagex. It's also a studio that's known more as an animation studio, making animated videos shared on YouTube, that is now entering the video game industry with Brass Rain as its debut title.</p>



<p>It's able to fund the title thanks to $2.9 million of crowdfunding from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Yarnhub">the community it built with its YouTube channel</a>, which currently has over 2.7 million subscribers. While it's been known as an animation studio, making a game has been a long time coming, and something that the studio's community has been asking the company to try for a long time.</p>



<p>"<em>Our audience has been asking for us to make a game for years,</em>" said David Webb, chief executive officer at Yarnhub, in a press release. "<em>They've told us exactly what they want: a game with heart, historical authenticity, global campaigns, and multiplayer combat that lets them fight as infantry, tank crews, bomber gunners, and naval teams. Brass Rain is our answer to that call, built from the ground up with the community in mind</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Brass Rain isn't just a game, it's a living historical experience shaped by the millions who watch our films every month</em>," continued Cyril Barrow, head of games at Yarnhub Studios. "<em>Our community challenged us to go beyond what games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/edenspark-war-thunder-devs-gaijin-entertainment-open-source-ai-assisted-game-making/">War Thunder</a> and World of Tanks offer, by adding the one thing they've always wanted: boots-on-the-ground infantry. We're delivering a fully crew-based combat experience that lets players fight together across land, sea, and air, and experience history as they go</em>."</p>



<p>According to the press release, Yarnhub is moving forward with a free-to-play model because of its success on YouTube and the crowdfunding it has accomplished so far. There will be "<em>some of the lowest-cost cosmetic microtransactions in gaming</em>" included in its free-to-play model, according to the studio. We'll have to get price matches on that claim to see if it holds water, but for now, it's nice to see Yarnhub at least trying to approach free-to-play in a way that won't try to gauge players.</p>



<p>Brass Rain will launch in early access on Steam sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>PUBG: Black Budget is a new extraction shooter spin-off within the PUBG world from Krafton and PUBG Studios, currently in development for PC. If you've been waiting for a chance to check out this upcoming PvPvE shooter, then your shot is coming, as the studio has announced it will host a closed alpha test in December that players can sign up for now.</p>



<p>As is the case with most closed alphas, signing up doesn't guarantee you a spot; it just puts you in the running for one. Still, it's worth putting your name in if you're looking for a new extraction shooter to spend some time with. The closed alpha will take place over two sessions, the first running from December 12-14, and the second from December 19-21. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4077740/PUBG_Black_Budget/">sign up by requesting access to the closed alpha on the game's Steam page.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>PUBG: Black Budget is set on an island called Coli, an island that's stuck in a time loop and being consumed by a mysterious supernatural phenomenon called the Anomaly. You'll deal with other players and enemy threats while you try to scrounge as much top-secret tech from the island, looking for anything that can lead to the truth behind what's happening on Coli and a secret, black budget initiative codenamed SAPIENS.</p>



<p>It's all together an interesting premise, though no one plays extraction shooters for their storytelling capabilities. It'll be more interesting, of course, to see how it plays next month, and if it's the latest extraction shooter that can carve out a place for itself in this increasingly competitive genre.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the major extraction shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">in the industry at the moment continues to be ARC Raiders</a>, so Krafton and PUBG Studios will have to try making a comparable splash to get players' attention when a new extraction shooter just entered the space that fans of the genre are still enamoured with. </p>



<p>And while that's going on, Krafton continues to deal with its case against Unknown Worlds co-founders over the development of Subnautica 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-strikes-back-unknown-worlds-founders-sharing-files-racist-views-korea/">a case that just took another major and unexpected turn</a> (though after the third unexpected turn, it was worth it to just expect unexpected turns).</p>

			<p>The Nioh 3 PC system requirements have been confirmed today, detailing the system configurations that can run the game at 1080p resolution, 30 and 60 frames per second.</p>



<p>The requirements, which can be found in full below, aren't particularly demanding for 1080p gameplay, although upscaling will be required to reach the listed targets. The system requirements listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/">Steam</a> also confirm the game will support Frame Generation without providing additional information.</p>

<p>Although the Nioh 3 system requirements aren't particularly demanding, previous Team NINJA games released on PC, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo-Long Fallen Dynasty</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-is-yet-another-disappointing-pc-port-from-koei-tecmo/">Rise of the Ronin</a>, essentially required much better system configurations than suggested to deal with their significant launch performance issues. Hopefully, this won't be the case in the game.</p>



<p>While I can't say how Nioh 3 will run on PC when it launches on February 6 worldwide, I can safely say the third entry in the series is setting out to be a great action RPG, and the culmination of all the most recent games released by Team NINJA. You can learn more about the game's new exploration mechanics and more by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/">checking out my hands-on preview.</a></p>
