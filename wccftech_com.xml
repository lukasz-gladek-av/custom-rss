			<p>NetEase Games has announced today that the cross-platform test for Once Human has begun, where it will be testing the cross-platform feature for mobile devices and PC in particular. This will benefit players greatly, as it will widen the pool of players available to interact with, as well as giving them more of a chance to build, engage in combat, and explore the post-apocalyptic world that has been taken over by Lovecraftian creatures.</p>
<p>At the moment, Once Human is only available on PC, but the game will be available on Android and iOS devices come April 2025, and the versions will be cross-compatible.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in joining Once Human's current cross-platform test, it is currently live and will be available to participate in until March 30. Players across Europe, Japan, and North America can sign up to participate. To sign up, you can either <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/863iir/paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete a survey</a> within Once Human or join through the official social media for Once Human. There are limited slots for this test, so make sure you sign up quickly.</p>
<p>For those who want to test the game on mobile, iOS users will have to participate through TestFlight, while Android users will have to install the game's APK from the official website. Of course, for those on PC, the process is significantly easier, and you can jump into the test via the game's official client once you've been added to the test.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the cross-platform test will be using the current global server environment from the PC version of Once Human. This means that those joining on mobile or PC will get access to all Scenarios, as well as the Visional Wheel and Lunar Oracle.</p>
<p>In addition to the cross-platform test, pre-registration is now live for the mobile version of Once Human. The full launch of the mobile version is scheduled for an unmentioned date in April 2025. You can<a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/129/f42m6hk9tex0ofpxkzu7weoo7/3/c52da950fe9ce2ab511d86047fac03b84befe1d1625a354bd30a7d621e7f76c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-register</a> your interest in playing the mobile version of Once Human, where you can then win in-game rewards, which include some great weapons and items that can prove beneficial to your journey. You can also try your luck by pre-registering, as you'll be entered into a draw to win an iPhone 16 Pro Max.</p>
<p>Since its release, Once Human has performed very well and has received a multitude of updates, including specific PvP Scenarios and<a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-august-update-out-includes-animal-ranching/"> Animal Ranching</a>, for those who prefer to have a little bit of a farm life in the game.</p>
