			<p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from legendary indie developers Yacht Club Games, the team behind beloved 2D platformer <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/shovel-knight-spectre-of-torment/">Shovel Knight</a>, finally has a release date. It'll arrive on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC on October 31, 2025.</p>
<p>Since Shovel Knight launched, Yacht Club has only made <a href="https://wccftech.com/shovel-knight-dig-king-of-cards-showdown/">Shovel Knight-related games</a>, with a brief publishing stint to publish Cyber Shadow. Mina the Hollower is the first non-shovel-related game developed by Yacht Club in a decade.</p>
<p>Thankfully, players who've been waiting for something totally new from Yacht Club for years don't have to wait entirely until October 31 to try out Mina the Hollower, as there's a demo available on PC right now.</p>

<p>Whereas Shovel Knight had his shovel, Mina the Hollower has her whip and digging abilities, and by the look of the trailer, there will still be plenty of platforming for players to enjoy.</p>
<p>Yacht Club games is arguably one of the best indie developers in the industry right now, so expectations for everything they make are set very high. After so long without anything not involving a shovel, it'll be interesting to see how Mina the Hollower lands with players when it arrives this coming Halloween.</p>
