<p>The new Ys X: Proud Nordics is set to make the tenth entry in the Falcom series an even better game. Although the game starts slow, making the first five or so hours a little off-putting, the game eventually blooms in one of the finest entries in the series, thanks to an engaging story and great combat mechanics which force players to balance offense and defense, and push the series forward beyond the party-based system introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-seven-pc-start-new-era/">YS Seven.</a> You can learn more about the game by<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/"> checking out my review.</a></p>

			<p>Tarsier Studios, the team behind the first two Little Nightmares games, has announced the release date for its first new game since it released Little Nightmares 2. Reanimal, the latest horror adventure from the team will arrive on PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X/S this coming February 13, 2026.</p>



<p>This announcement comes just hours before the team is set to show off more of Reanimal <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">during Xbox's Partner Preview event later today</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-reanimal-release-date-q1-2026/">it solidifies what Tarsier told us in August</a>, which was that the game would arrive sometime during Q1 2026.</p>



<p>You can pre-order the game now on all platforms for $39.99 USD, though if you're unsure you'd want to jump into this new title from Tarsier, the studio has also put out a demo that is now available on PS5 and Xbox Series consoles as well as PC. A Nintendo Switch 2 demo is also on its way, though it will be available at a later date.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/">At Gamescom 2025, Wccftech's Francesco De Meo got the chance to demo the game ahead of release, </a>and though he concluded it wasn't enough time to definitively say whether Tarsier has something very special on its hands, it was enough time to know that this studio still knows what its doing. Reanimal could be the beginning of a new massive franchise that'll bloom in the way Little Nightmares has, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">now has multiple projects in the works across multiple mediums</a>, not just video games.</p>
