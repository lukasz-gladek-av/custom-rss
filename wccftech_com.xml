			<p>Research and analysis firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies">Alinea Analytics reports</a> that ARC Raiders, the new third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has reached 2.5 million copies sold across all platforms in its debut week, with the vast majority of those sales coming from PC players.</p>



<p>According to Alinea Analytics, across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, 69% of ARC Raiders sales came from PC players on Steam, with 17.3% coming from PlayStation players and the remaining 13% coming from Xbox players.</p>

<p>It was already clear that ARC Raiders was having a strong commercial start <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">when it surpassed 200K concurrent players on Steam on its launch day</a> (and eventually hit over 260K). As its debut week came to a close, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimates-range-1-6-1-9-million-units-on-steam/">analysts predicted it had sold somewhere between 1.6 and 1.9 million copies</a>.</p>



<p>The real number is, thankfully for Embark Studios, even higher than those predictions, as the studio also collects well over $100 million in revenue from the game being on the market for one week. It's handily a bigger launch than Embark Studio's other major multiplayer game, The Finals, and could very well outlast it partly because of its different approach as a premium release and not a free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Of course, the new extraction shooter still has a long way to go. It passed the first hurdle for a multiplayer game by having a great launch, and now the real test becomes its capacity for longevity. Right now, ARC Raiders has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1w">yet to fall below 90K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and even its dip below 100K was only for a very short period of time.</p>



<p>If we're still seeing numbers like that from ARC Raiders in a year, then we'll have a much better sample size for how successful this game can really be. Speaking of what's to come for ARC Raiders, Embark Studios has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">put out a roadmap for the game's updates for the rest of the year, which you can check out here</a>.</p>

			<p>Despite lacking TPM 2.0 support, the old AMD FX-9590 CPU is capable of running Battlefield 6, and even at playable framerates.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@FullyBuffered">Fully Buffered</a> attempted to run the latest entry in the series by EA on two old CPUs, the Intel Core i7-2600K and the aforementioned AMD FX-9590. While the game wouldn't launch on the Intel CPU due to the lack of Secure Boot support, the AMD CPU could launch and run the game, having Secure Boot support. As such, it seems like not supporting TPM 2.0 doesn't prevent a CPU from running the game, as lacking SecureBoot support does.</p>



<p>Although the AMD FX-9590 is an old CPU released over 10 years ago, it runs Battlefield 6 surprisingly well, paired with an RX 5700 8 GB GPU. In Conquest mode with a total of 64 players, the game runs at a mid-30s FPS range, occasionally reaching the 40s range at 1080p resolution, which is very impressive for an older CPU. In other game modes, and by lowering the resolution, the game even hits the mid-40s range. Unsurprisingly, all of the CPU's core are pushed to their limit to run the game, hitting 98% utilization at 4,65 GHz.</p>

<p>An old CPU, such as the AMD FX-9590, running Battlefield 6 as well as it does, confirms the greater attention the development team put into optimizing the game and ensuring it could run well even on low-spec systems. Before the game launched, technical director Christian Buhl confirmed that <span>among the millions of players who joined the Battlefield 6 open beta,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/" target="_blank">a substantial number were on minimum specs or below.</a>&nbsp;Therefore, it was essential</span> for the team to optimize for these low specs to ensure all players could enjoy the game. Overcoming the technical limitations of the Xbox Series S also made <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/">Battlefield 6 a better game from a technical standpoint.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, one of the best games in 2025, and one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-ultimate-game-of-the-year-award-major-indies-stacked/">games contending for game of the year</a> is going to be <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/play-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-for-free-this-weekend-on-steam">free for players to try on Steam and Xbox Series X/S starting today</a>, November 6, 2025, until this coming Monday, November 10, 2025. This free weekend comes just ahead of the launch of its third and final DLC, Mysteria Ecclesiae, which launches on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Along with the free weekend, if you do decide to grab the full game, then you'll get it at a 40% off discount on both Steam and Xbox, though PlayStation fans seem to be left out of the fun, as there is no mention of a free weekend for PlayStation or a discount on PlayStation consoles.</p>

<p>When Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 released at the beginning of this year in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's reviewer, Chris Wray, gave the game a 10/10, writing</a>, "<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will launch together with the Valley of Memory expansion to introduce gameplay changes and new features, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/assassins-creed/news/62bserGVoUbHQPrsGCasOU/assassins-creed-mirage-new-gameplay-features-and-valley-of-memory-expansion">The new update</a> launching together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-free-dlc-release-date-reveal-november/">the free expansion on November 18</a> on all formats will introduce some brand new features, starting with the ability to replay all black box missions and contracts after they have been cleared once. Each replayable mission presents distinct challenges that require players to approach these missions creatively, such as avoiding the use of Eagle Vision, targeting only the main enemy, and more. Completing these missions grants the player exclusive in-game rewards usable in New Game +.</p>



<p>The upcoming free Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also introduce a new free jump option that will allow players to jump manually, a new control scheme to smooth parkour that works better with free jump turned on, a Back and Side Ejects Mode, which allows Basim to perform ejects regardless of the presence of a safe landing spot and a few other parkous tweaks to make the experience smoother.</p>



<p>Finally, the new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also add a new skill called Engineer 2 that will allow him to equip all level 1 enhancements to his tools, and a new level 3 modification that will power up every tool. Rounding up the new features included in the update is the inclusion of new difficulty levels called Hardened Assassin, which will sport enemies with higher defense than Assassin difficulty, and Ultimate Assassin, the hardest difficulty in the game.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.
