			<p>We've seen game clones in our day, but perhaps none has ever been so blatantly inspired by a game like Light of Motiram, a newly announced open world game that practically mimics every key visual element of Guerrilla's Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>
<p>Young redhead female protagonist? Check. Gorgeous natural environments to explore following the collapse of civilization? Check. Animal-like machines? Check, check, check. Big boss fights that require precise timing and execution? You got the gist.</p>
<p>To be honest, Palworld is far more removed from Pokemon by comparison, and that one has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a lawsuit from Nintendo anyway. We'll see if Sony moves to sue as well. It would have to go against Tencent, as the developer of Light of Motiram is Polaris Quest, one of the Chinese giant's subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Anyway, to be fair, there are a few gameplay differences compared to Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Forbidden West. To start with, this game features extensive survival and building mechanics:</p>
<p><em>In this mechanical wilderness where civilization is a distant memory, primal cultures, extreme weather, and lurking Mechanimals will constantly test your survival skills. Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses. Every step is fraught with danger and requires courage.</em></p>
<p><em>Unleash your creativity with a freeform building system powered by realistic physics simulation. Construct a fortified stronghold or a cleverly designed shelter. Every beam and brick is subject to real-world physical forces, ensuring that your structures are both visually stunning and able to withstand environmental challenges.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The taming and training mechanics are also far more in-depth than in Guerrilla's game. Light of Motiram promises over a hundred customizable Mechanimals to tame and train.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the game supports seamless cooperative multiplayer for up to ten players to adventure together. The official description also mentions cross-play, although Light of Motiram has only been announced for PC and will be released via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/light-of-motiram-094dff?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> at an unannounced time. By the way, minimum and recommended system requirements are already available and should not be a problem for anyone who has built a gaming PC in the last five or six years.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/">Digital Extremes</a> and Valve are currently giving away free copies of Dark Sector, the third-person title made by the Warframe devs. From today until November 30, PC games will be able to obtain this game for free by visiting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam store page</a> for Dark Sector. This game is a third-person action shooter that was first released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2008 and then was ported to Steam in 2009. If you've been wanting to try this game out but weren't sure whether you want to spend money on it, this is a great time to get hold of it and add it to your backlog.</p>
<p>Dark Sector is a game that does have mixed reviews, mainly based on the visual design of the game. This game has been compared to Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War by critics. Themes that were seen in Dark Sector were also seen in Warframe. For example, the name Tenno is seen very frequently throughout Warframe, as that is the name of the faction that is controlled by players.</p>
<p>In this game, you play Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum), a man who works at the CIA. In this game, you witness Hayden go through a transformation, as he has been infected with the Technocyte Virus on his right arm, which then begins to take over his entire body. As a result of the Technocyte Virus, you see his psyche begin to deteriorate. However, he begins to gain superhuman powers, including the ability to grow a bladed glaive on his arm. With this glaive, he can throw it at his enemies with precision. As you progress through the game, you see Hayden begin to transform further, and his powers evolve, making him a deadly force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Dark Sector's main focus is a single-player campaign, but the game also features a multiplayer game mode. At the moment, it's uncertain whether the multiplayer game mode is still active, but due to the game being free on Steam for now, it's possible that the multiplayer game mode will still be active and available to play.</p>
<p>The Steam Autumn Sale is also on right now, which will provide many discounts for any games that may be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Dark Sector?</p>
