			<p>CCP Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, its new space survival MMO, has now opened public access with 'Founder Access: New Era' following the previous Closed Alpha stage.</p>
<p>EVE Frontier is set in an enigmatic and hostile galaxy shaped by its players' activities. Players inhabit Riders: awakened clones flung into the Frontier without purpose or memory of the world around them. As they explore the darkness, they must construct shelters, form Tribes, and gather resources to increase their power and survive the ever-present danger of annihilation.</p>
<p>Founder Access: New Era also introduces a brand-new seasonal progression system for EVE Frontier called Cycles. The first cycle, Promised Lands, begins today. Players will earn Grace by completing in-game missions and activities and rise to the top of each Cycle Leaderboard alongside their Tribe. As the New Era progresses, new missions, objectives, and content will be introduced in subsequent Cycles.</p>
