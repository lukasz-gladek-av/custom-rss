            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-remasters-could-be-announced-on-the-franchises-20th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We first <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-rumored-to-be-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> rumors about the God of War Greek saga remaster plan in October 2024. That rumor suggested Sony Santa Monica would be working with Nixxes Software to enhance the beloved original trilogy for modern hardware.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckoned</a> the announcement would come at the February State of Play, but that turned out to be incorrect. Now, insider Jeff Grubb has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bdacp2cmuuyawx553cv2spdy/post/3liqdacmdnc23?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the news could be officially confirmed in time for the franchise's 20th anniversary. This would land on March 22, which marked the original game's debut in North America (Europe, as was customary back then, had to wait until July 7).</p>
<p>We don't have any details on what would be included. However, we can guess there would be significant graphical improvements over the previous remasters (the first two games were remastered for PlayStation 3, and the last one for PlayStation 4), as well as possibly some quality-of-life enhancements. It is highly unlikely that it would be anything more than that, as that'd make it more of a remake than a remaster, and the scope of a full-fledged remake of the God of War trilogy would be massive.</p>
<p>It's interesting that Sony would be willing to bring those games back to the market once again. While they do serve as a backstory for Kratos as we've seen him in the Norse mythology continuation, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV series adaptation in the making at Amazon Prime Video</a> will be based on the latter, not on the Greek saga. As a reminder, the adaptation was originally meant to be led by Rafe Judkins, but the showrunner left the project and was replaced in late 2024 by Ronald D. Moore, who is known for his work on acclaimed TV shows like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, and For All Mankind.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful launch of Avowed</a>, Pillars of Eternity creator Josh Sawyer did an LA Wild Fire Relief Stream yesterday <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2388422071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Obsidian's Twitch channel</a>. During the lengthy stream, he played the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released game</a> and talked about various topics.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sawyer revealed that there's quite a lot of interest within the team to make a 'Pillars Tactics' game, although there is uncertainty about its commercial success.</p>
<p><em>Pillars Tactics is a thing that a lot of people at the studio would like to work on, and there are a lot of people who like tactics games. Figuring out a scope for it is tricky. A scope of development where it feels like it could actually make money, because tactics games have a very enthusiastic fan base, but the fan base is not humongous. It's sort of like that floor is high - like, if you make a decent tactics game, those people are going to buy it. But if all of them buy it, that's still not that many people.</em></p>
<p>Over a year ago, following the incredible success of Baldur's Gate 3, Sawyer <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> he'd love to do a more tactical, turn-based Pillars of Eternity 3 if Microsoft would only provide the triple-A budget for it.</p>
<p><em>I think that would be a lot of fun to do, to do like a high production value party based fantasy RPG. I’m pretty happy with Pillars and Deadfire, but I do think that if it were not crowdfunded, I would probably make it turn based. I’m not saying to not have a real time with pause system, but I do think that the Deadfire turn based system which I can’t take credit for, that Nick Carver and Brian MacIntosh did, was really cool. But, the game wasn’t designed for it, so actually designing the game for turn based, fewer encounters, smaller encounters, but much more tactical, I think that would be a lot of fun, and having awesome cinematics and all that stuff.</em></p>
<p>Still, as things stand, it seems more likely that Obsidian will continue making first-person action RPGs like Avowed and the upcoming The Outer Worlds 2, which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch sometime this year</a>.</p>

						<h5>AceZone A-Spire Wireless</h5><p><span>May 3rd, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>AceZone may not be among the most popular gaming headset brands, but it has been making a name for itself for some time by producing headsets for eSports tournaments, focusing on features tailored for this specific use case. In the past few years, however, the company entered the domestic headset market with some headsets, including the A-Spire and the A-Rise headsets, which brought some of these features, such as excellent noise canceling with Active Noise Control built for gaming, fast in-game response and more. The A-Spire model was later updated with some additional features, becoming the AceZone A-Spire Wireless, which is among the best headsets for eSports aficionados who want to step up their performance while also providing enough to to be enticing for those looking for a versatile headset that delivers great audio quality for single-player games and music playback.</p>
<p>At a glance, the AceZone A-Spire Wireless, which comes with a hard carry case, looks almost like a non-gaming headset, featuring a rather simple color scheme, black with some metallic grey highlights, with no other standout element. On the back of the left earpad are the power button and the Active Noise Cancelation button, while on the right are the volume control and pause/play buttons. On the side of the left earpad is also the microphone, which, sadly, cannot be removed from the headset (but this was to be expected for a headset tailored for eSports and competitive play). Disabling the microphone, however, is extremely simple, as it only has to be brought to a vertical position where it can easily held in place and secured.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04_cleanup.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the AceZone A-Spire Wireless design may be unremarkable, the headset shows its qualities right from the very first use. The excellent build quality, and its light weight, which makes the headset very comfortable to use even after 3+ hours in conjunction with the high-quality earpad foam, are only the beginning. Noise cancelling, as mentioned above, has always been one of the main focuses of AceZone for its headsets, and the AceZone A-Spire Wireless definitely delivers on this front. The Advanced Hybrid ANC built for gaming does an excellent job providing complete immersion, and during the vast majority of my gaming sessions with the headsets, I wasn't able to hear anything outside of the game's audio, as every loud noise was effectively canceled. To test how far the headset's noise canceling could go, I tested it out in a definitely not intended use case while playing acoustic drums, and the AceZone A-Spire Wireless still did an excellent job, as I could clearly hear the click and backing tracks clearly while playing some heavy music.</p>
<p>Pressing the dedicated ANC button on the left earpad also enables Transparency Mode, which amplifies ambient sound, allowing it to pass through the headset and let the user hear the outside world clearly without removing the headset.&nbsp; The AceZone A-Spire Wireless microphone noise canceling is possibly even more impressive, as the microphone works great and effectively only picks up the user's voice while filtering out even some pretty loud noises, although it has to be positioned slightly closer to the mouth than the vast majority of other headsets on the market to work properly, which may take some time to get used to.</p>
<p>The biggest update the AceZone A-Spire Wireless offers over the base model, not is its proper wireless capabilities. Included in the box is a USB dongle that is effectively plug-and-play, as the user does not have to do anything other than keep a button pressed on the dongle to pair the headset with it. Latency with the dongle is pretty much non-existent, although the 2.4 GHz connection could suffer from interference, which I didn't experience as all the devices I use with my PC are wired. The AceZone A-Spire Wireless can also be connected via a regular headphone jack, such as the one included with the headset, and via a regular Bluetooth connection, which works well, but not as well as with the dongle. Pairing and using the headset with a PlayStation 5 and an Android mobile phone was just as painless, and the Bluetooth connection worked great in both instances with no latency, although your experience may vary depending on interference from other devices.</p>
<p>All this wouldn't matter much if the AceZone A-Spire Wireless delivered poor audio quality, but that is most definitely not the case here. The contrary, actually, as the headset delivers great audio quality in the vast majority of scenarios, and some of the best audio quality in eSports games, where the headset, unsurprisingly, truly shines. The game's sound design really has to accommodate its unique features. In a game like Counter-Strike 2, for example, it is possible to clearly hear sounds like footsteps from further away than with other headsets and place them very accurately. In other competitive-focused games, however, the AceZone A-Spire Wireless may not help players level up their game a lot, as loud music or sound unrelated to the gameplay end up drowning sounds that could help the player understand where the opponents are and so on.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/02_cleanup.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the AceZone A-Spire Wireless has been designed mostly for eSports, I have found the headset to be quite versatile, making it a worthwhile purchase even for those who aren't into competitive play. In games I have played for hundreds of hours and know extremely well, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Tales of Graces f, I was able to hear sounds I never noticed, such as environmental sounds that usually get lost in lower-quality headsets and audio systems, which, in conjunction with the excellent noise canceling, increased immersion considerably. In a game designed to be as immersive as possible, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, the headset fared even better, allowing me to listen to all sorts of environmental sounds so clearly that I really felt like I was Henry from Skalitz, traveling in medieval Bohemia. Something similar happened when listening to music, as, for example, I was able to hear clearly drummers keeping time with the hi-hat pedal, which is usually a very soft sound that doesn't emerge in most mixes, especially in heavy music like Progressive and Extreme Metal.</p>
<p>The AceZone A-Spire Wireless tries to do something different even in regards to changing settings. All of the company's headsets are compatible with a free smart device app that allows the user to set up different equalization presets for both the headphones and the microphone, tweak Transparency, enable Outside Mode, which lowers wind noise when the headset is used outdoors, and Glasses Mode, which optimizes ANC damping performance when wearing them. The best thing about the app is that it saves settings straight into the headset so that even console players can tweak them with ease.</p>
<p>All the advanced features of the AceZone A-Spire Wireless are extremely good to have, but the real question for most will be if the headset is worth its somewhat high price. That strictly depends on the user. For eSport titles with the proper sound design, the headset truly shines, giving players the same tools the best players in the world use in tournaments, giving them the chance to improve their performance. For regular use with single-player gaming and for music playback, on the other hand, the value of the AceZone A-Spire Wireless' unique features is somewhat diminished, and a more affordable headset may be more enticing. Still, if one is not afraid to spend a little more than usual, they will find a great headset that may give them a greater appreciation of the sound design of their favorite games, regardless of the genre.</p>
