			<p>REPLACED, the 2.5D pixel-art-based cyberpunk platformer that was first showcased at E3 2021 and was arguably one of the most exciting prospective Xbox exclusives at the time of its reveal, finally has a release date, and will arrive on PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, and on Xbox Series X/S this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>This announcement follows developer Sad Cat Studios' announcement in August 2025 that it could confirm, "<em>with confidence</em>," <a href="https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-spring-2026-cyberpunk-platformer/">that REPLACED would be out by Spring 2026</a>. That confidence has clearly not waned, and we now have a release date for a game that, by the looks of its release date trailer, hasn't lost any of the special quality players saw in that 2021 reveal.</p>



<p>The new trailer is the best look at the game we've gotten in the years since its initial announcement, and backed by an original song from the game's soundtrack titled "<em>Dusk</em>," it appears to be firing on all cylinders ahead of its March release.</p>

<p>As to why Sad Cat Studios took as long as it did to get to this point, it wasn't because Sad Cat Studios was toiling away, working on the game non-stop and burning time. Development was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">interrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, pushing it to the point we're at now, where a game that would have otherwise come out somewhere between 2021 and 2023 is out in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>We know that our community is incredibly excited to play REPLACED and it's no secret that it's taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all - we apologize for that,</em>" said game director Yura Zhdanovich in a press release back in August when the studio announced the release window. "<em>We've always tried to do what's right for the project,</em> <em>which in turn means delivering to you a truly special experience."</em></p>



<p>We'll see what Sad Cat Studios has for players when REPLACED launches on PC and Xbox Series X/S on March 12, 2026.</p>
