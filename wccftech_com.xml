			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has been the one bright spot in Ubisoft's troubled times over the last couple of years. Even though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">wasn't able to contend with Ghost of Yotei on PlayStation consoles</a>, the company's recent first-half year results report <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">noted that Shadows overperformed overall</a>. Despite that, however, and despite the fact that Ubisoft's original plan was to put out multiple expansions for Shadows, it now seems like Claws of Awaji, which was released in September, will be the last - and only - DLC expansion the game receives.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">IGN</a>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>, associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois confirmed that, at least right now, Ubisoft is not planning to do another expansion for Shadows that is on the same scale as Claws of Awaji.</p>



<p>"<em>Well, we live in a murky world these days. So, with the caveat that anything can happen in the future, cause as [Assassin's Creed] Mirage just proved</em> <em>and as the crossover stories from [Assassin's Creed] Odyssey to [Assassin's Creed] Valhalla before it,</em> <em>things could come up in the future</em>," Lemay-Comtois began.</p>



<p>"<em>But</em> <em>as of now, at this moment, for Year 2, there is no expansion on the size</em> <em>of Awaji that is planned, currently. We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but</em> <em>it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years. And whether or not this is the right way to go or a good learning, I think it's more of an experience we're trying with Shadows, to keep it small and reactive, to see how the community feels about it and react to it. The learnings that come out of that will be applied to whatever other projects we do next</em>."</p>

<p>Lemay-Comtois continued to explain that for Year One, the team's approach was to try and be as reactive as possible, but with Year Two, the team can slow down as it's not "<em>putting out fires</em>" anymore, and really decide what solid "<em>chunks of meat</em>" they can release for Shadows.</p>



<p>Listening to Lemay-Comtois, it sounds clear that Ubisoft shifted in its plans for Shadows. Though, as Lemay-Comtois points out, anything can still happen, it seems like the chances of another proper DLC expansion for Shadows are slim to none, and Slim is getting ready to leave town.</p>



<p>This directional change could also be due to the completion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's deal with Tencent and the finalization of Vantage Studios</a>. Now that the Assassin's Creed franchise is under the new subsidiary, it could be the case that everything about how the franchise is carried forward is getting some sort of re-evaluation, including the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>

			<p>Niko Partners, the analytics firm covering the video game industry in Asia and MENA markets, published <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-news/">its latest weekly report</a>, which points to a potential source of problems for the Japanese video game market. As geopolitical tensions between Japan and China continue to rise, China might be inclined to take retaliatory actions, like starting to deny approval of Japanese games.</p>



<p>According to Niko Partners, "<em>Japan is the single largest source of import game approvals to China</em>, <em>accounting for roughly 30% of all licensed foreign titles over the past two years</em>." We know that China is a massive market that any publisher would want to be able to crack, since that would be millions of potential players. </p>



<p>Though the firm clarifies that there's been no indication China would stop approving games from Japan, it's definitely a possibility, and would be a huge blow to Japanese developers and publishers who have much of their business tied to Chinese players.</p>



<p>Issues between the two nations are currently rising due to comments from Japan's Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, who recently suggested, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-diplomat-dissatisfied-japan-talks-000859056.html?guccounter=1">per Bloomberg</a>, that Japan could interfere with China attempting to reunify Taiwan.</p>



<p>China has now called on Japan to retract the comments, and has already begun taking actions such as having flights cancelled and travel advisories issued on travel to Japan, suspending the importing of Japanese seafood, and pausing the approval of Japanese films.</p>



<p>With film approvals already getting paused, it's not a huge leap to imagine video games are next. We'll see how the rest of it continues to unfold, but if their relationship continues to decline, then it'll likely be quite some time <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">before we see the Nintendo Switch 2 make it over to China.</a></p>
