			<p>Apple and Epic Games have had bad ties for the past few years, especially after the latter introduced an alternative payment method that got it banned from the App Store. After years of lawsuits and rulings, Apple was ruled to be in violation of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-appeals-in-epic-games-lawsuit-wants-app-store-changes-delay/">2021 injunction</a> that required developers to redirect users to third-party purchase options on the web through dedicated in-app links. In response, Epic Games CEO and founder stated on X that Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store next week while offering Apple a proposal that could go in its favor in the long run.</p>
<h2>Epic proposes ending all legal disputes if Apple agrees to drop its 27 percent commission on external web transactions following the court ruling</h2>
<p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers has been handling the Apple vs. Epic Games battle for the past five years, and the latest remarks suggest that Apple is in "willful violation" of the 2021 injunction, which was provisioned to prevent anticompetitive behavior in the market. The ruling reads: "Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated." While Apple did allow developers to put an in-app link that would direct users to the web for payment, it also took a 12 to 27 percent cut from the transaction.</p>
<p>Epic Games escalated the scene, stating that the iPhone maker should be held in contempt of court for falling behind in complying with the order regarding the fee structure. Apple claimed it was already completely compliant with the injunction, but the judge took Epic's side. You can check out the 80-page order <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1508.0_2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>To summarize: One, after trial, the Court found that Apple's 30 percent commission "allowed it to reap supracompetitive operating margins" and was not tied to the value of its intellectual property, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple's response: charge a 27 percent commission (again tied to nothing) on off-app purchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the commission for a period of seven days after the consumer linked-out of the app. Apple's goal: maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream.</p>
<p>Two, the Court had prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers to, other purchasing mechanisms. Apple's response: impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page "scare" screens, static URLs, and generic statements. Apple's goal: to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream.</p>
<p>In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Judge Rogers also stated that the court "will not tolerate further delays" and that the company will not impede the competition. This means that the company should allow developers to communicate with the end-user, offering transactions outside of the app with an amended fee structure for transactions. You can check out the ruling below, which is effective immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app, and as a consequence thereof, no reason exists to audit, monitor, track or require developers to report purchases or any other activity that consumers make outside an app;</li>
<li>Restricting or conditioning developers' style, language, formatting, quantity, flow or placement of links for purchases outside an app;</li>
<li>Prohibiting or limiting the use of buttons or other calls to action, or otherwise conditioning the content, style, language, formatting, flow or placement of these devices for purchases outside an app;</li>
<li>Excluding certain categories of apps and developers from obtaining link access;</li>
<li>Interfering with consumers' choice to proceed in or out of an app by using anything other than a neutral message apprising users that they are going to a third-party site;</li>
<li>Restricting a developer's use of dynamic links that bring consumers to a specific product page in a logged-in state rather than to a statically defined page, including restricting apps from passing on product details, user details or other information that refers to the user intending to make a purchase.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The court has referred the case to the United States Attorney for the North District of California, allowing it to "investigate whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate." Tim Sweeney took to X to share his thoughts on the ruling, stating that Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store in the United States next week. However, he also proposed that Epic Games would "drop all current and future litigation" if Apple complies with the ruling.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week.</p>
<p>Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic. <a href="https://t.co/bIRTePm0Tv">https://t.co/bIRTePm0Tv</a></p>
<p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At this stage, it remains to be seen if Apple will challenge the ruling and keep the case an ongoing fiasco or will finally succumb and introduce new policies and drop the off-app transaction fee for developers. The move could end Apple's quarrel with Epic but also hurt its revenue from its services. As we speak, Apple's Services revenue is a quarter of the total, and it could give all developers a nudge to shift their payment methods outside the app. We will keep you updated with the latest, so keep an eye out.</p>

			<p>Gearbox showcased Borderlands 4 gameplay in a big way with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/">State of Play</a> presentation that dug deeper into the changes in the game's loot, gear, movement, and overall gameplay, along with a few story tidbits.</p>
<p>The presentation took 20 minutes to show off a new gameplay trailer, before getting into different elements of Borderlands 4. It was also, expectedly, since it was a PlayStation presentation, all PS5 Pro gameplay footage.</p>
<p>One of the first changes you'll notice is your new movement capabilities. Being able to glide, for example, has a huge impact on how you can move around in combat and while exploring the world. You also have a grapple hook that can grab onto certain spots.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkIqhvWWiQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Or, if you find one of a new kind of overworld activity in Borderlands 4, a Silo, you can launch yourself into the air to cover larger distances.</p>
<p>Another big change is that we're not on Pandora anymore, and have landed on a new planet called Kairos, which had been kept a galaxy-wide secret by a new antagonist called the Timekeeper. Basically, the Timekeeper kept the planet's population from leaving by controlling them with chips in their brains called bolts.</p>
<p>When a moon somehow teleported into the orbit of Kairos, it caused a big hullabaloo in the Timekeeper's keep-the-planet-a-secret protective cover, and the chips essentially stopped working. People started tearing them out of their skulls, and now there's a lot of fighting. That's where you, along with other fan-favorite vault hunter characters, along with a few new additions, enter the scene to help put an end to the Timekeeper.</p>
<p>The presentation introduced two of the new vault hunters joining the team, Rafa, an exosuited soldier, and a siren called Vex, who can summon her own familiar called 'Trouble,' who is a phantom giant alien sabertooth tiger that does different elemental attacks according to how you've chosen to customize your arsenal.</p>
<p>Which leads into what was a major portion of the presentation, how weapon customization has changed, and how character customization has changed, all before getting into the choices Borderlands players are used to with elemental damage and weapon types from various in-world weapons manufacturers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - State of Play Deep Dive | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A key change is that you can customize weapons by putting together a gun that includes different parts from different manufacturers, to try and create the weapon that fits how you'd like to play. But that only gets interesting to make when you've found the right loot, and in terms of finding loot, Gearbox also confirmed that it has "<em>overhauled</em>" how drop rates work in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>According to Gearbox, the times you find a legendary weapon will "<em>truly be special events</em>" once again in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>In terms of how you can customize your vault hunter, each one will have a passive ability, and three "<em>action skills</em>" you can swap between. You can choose which action skill you use with that vault hunter, and then you can also improve and adjust that skill through its skill tree. Each of the three action skills a vault hunter has also has a skill tree, which you can re-spec and adjust how you like as you play.</p>
<p>Most of the focus in this presentation was on how key elements of the gameplay have changed, but plenty more about the game was notably missing. We didn't get any showcase on what the story will feel like; other than that, it'll have a serious moment or two.</p>
<p>Not to say the lighthearted elements of Borderlands won't be there, just that it was absent here. This was definitely a gameplay-first presentation, which is all fine and well, but it will be curious to see players' reactions when we eventually see that side of the game. Some of the loudest complaints players had about Borderlands 3 came from the dialogue and the story, with the biggest issue many players had being the two villains.</p>
<p>A repeat of that situation here would definitely be a disappointment, but if all the gameplay changes hold up, it won't be a deal-breaker for many players.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> is a great remaster in terms of it being a very-well done boost in graphical fidelity from the original, but it's also great because it was more than just the original game with a graphics boost.</p>
<p>It also included a new expansion called In the Beginning, with 18 new puzzles to solve, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of which</a> were actually made in collaboration with members of the Talos Principle's community.</p>
<p>So it's no wonder that they are some of the most difficult puzzles in the whole series. They're not impossible, mind you, they're just very difficult. The thing is that there's always a trick to them, and if you want a hint for Subway Escape before getting the whole solution, the hint here is that creating redundancies will take you far.</p>
<p>That's your hint, but if you just want to know the steps to solve the puzzle, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Subway Escape Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>When you walk into the Subway Escape puzzle area, it's immediately a bit confusing. There's a subway cart in the center of the room behind a fence and two shields on one side. You also can't head forward across the tracks, due to the walls being lined with turrets. Solving Subway Escape, thankfully, has nothing to do with these elements. Everything about the puzzle begins when you walk through the purple forcefield on the left side of the room and pick up the jammer.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the jammer and head around the corner towards the shield blocking the path to an elevator. Use the jammer on the shield.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Turn around and grab the connector you walked by on your way to the elevator, and take the elevator down with the connector in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you get to the bottom floor, you'll see another jammer (J2) keeping a shield in front of you deactivated. Walk into the room and grab J2 to deactivate the shield on the right-hand side of the room. Then, use the connector to connect the red laser generator to the red node, creating a redundancy with J2, and the red laser, keeping the shield deactivated.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up J2 and walk it to the other side of the shield so you can keep the shield deactivated while grabbing the connector and bringing it to the corner of the room.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use J2 to deactivate the shield blocking your path to the fan, pressure switch, and hexahedron behind the shield on your right.&nbsp;Place the hexahedron on the pressure switch, pick up the connector, and jump on the fan to fly up to the second level.&nbsp;Head down the stairs and walk towards the middle of the room so that you can place the connector in a spot where you can connect it to the blue node and blue laser generator on the bottom level. This has now created a redundancy with the shield J2 is deactivating and the blue laser.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the bottom level and grab J2. Fly back up to the second level with J2 in hand, and place it next to the connector.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and jump back down to the bottom floor so that you can leave the connector on the pressure switch that activates the fan, and carry the hexahedron up with you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>You'll have noticed that so far, we've been ignoring the second hexahedron sitting on the purple forcefield, and that's because we haven't needed it yet. Grab it, and the other hexahedron and place them both beside J2.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>This next part is simple, but a little tedious. You simply have to use the hexahedrons to 'walk' across the purple forcefield. If you fall off the hexahedrons, you'll have to reset, so don't fall off. Step by step, while staying on top of the hexahedrons, make your way across the purple forcefield to the other side with J2 in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedrons on the two pressure switches to deactivate the shield in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>With J2 in hand, walk through the deactivated shield to jump back down to the bottom floor, and take the elevator back up to the top floor.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now, take both J2 and J1 back to the purple forcefield you walked through to get into this area, and use them to deactivate the two layers of shields blocking the way to the subway cart and the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk over to the tetromino inside the cart to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you'll be able to take the subway cart through the hall of turrets and to the next puzzle, which is arguably the most difficult puzzle included in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
