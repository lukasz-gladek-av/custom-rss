			<p>This afternoon, CD Projekt RED VP and Game Director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571?t=qKSrHnijalfbeBpYM8C1lw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via Twitter (X) that The Witcher 4 is officially in full scale production after recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ending</a> the pre-production phase. He also shared his confidence that the new saga could be a remarkable experience for fans.</p>
<p><em>I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase! With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!⚔️</em></p>
<p>Kalemba shared a picture with the tweet. This could be our very first look at The Witcher 4.</p>

<p>We first heard of the new game over two and a half years ago when CD Projekt RED also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>they were abandoning their own REDEngine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. At the time, they called it a true partnership where they would also contribute back to the game-making tool. CTO Paweł Zawodny said:</p>
<p><em>From the outset, we did not consider a typical licensing arrangement; both we and Epic see this as a long-term, fulfilling tech partnership. It is vital for CD Projekt Red to have the technical direction of our next game decided from the earliest possible phase as; in the past, we spent a lot of resources and energy to evolve and adapt REDengine with every subsequent game release. This cooperation is so exciting, because it will elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools. I can’t wait for the great games we’re going to create using Unreal Engine 5!</em></p>
<p>The switch could speed up the development of future games, but that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-not-speeding-development-cdpr-hopes-helps-in-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't apply</a> to The Witcher 4, since the team is still familiarizing itself with the new tool. When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-aims-to-go-beyond-current-rpgs-says-cdpr-itll-be-a-good-entry-point-for-new-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about the new installment last year, Sebastian Kalemba teased that the studio aims to surpass current RPGs with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-wont-just-retread-the-last-game-adding-new-features-and-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features and mechanics</a> that break boundaries. Moreover, the new The Witcher game will be a great entry point for newcomers.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-polaris-first-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> the first actor who will work on the game. That info also revealed how voice-over and motion capture will begin in 2025. It's hard to say exactly when The Witcher 4 could launch, but it will be at least a couple more years if not more. Until then, you can beautify The Witcher 3 NextGen Edition with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HalkHogan's definitive texture mod</a>.</p>

			<p>Section 9 Interactive has entered a publishing partnership with Epic Games for an unannounced title. Section 9 comprises industry veterans, with some of them working on Little Nightmares and LittleBigPlanet PS Vita. On the Section 9 Interactive website, it says that they are "hard at work" on a new sci-fi action-adventure title that will be released for PC and the current generation of consoles. This studio is located in Malmo, Sweden, and the company is also currently hiring for an Environment Artist, 3D Artist, and Level Designer.</p>
<p>The new title will be made with Unreal Engine 5, and there are some glimpses of the game on their website. Of course, it comes with the notice that the footage is pre-alpha footage and is in no way representative of the final quality of the title. Section 9 Interactive also posted their news on social media, saying the following:</p>
<p>"We've entered a publishing partnership with EpicPublishing! Our team is very excited, as they've been tremendous partners in helping bring our creative vision to life. We appreciate everyone's support along the way and can't wait to share more soon!" <a href="https://x.com/section9int" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The X page</a> for Section 9 Interactive is sparse, but it shows that the company was a recipient of the Epic MegaGrants program in 2021. The social media page also shows off some short clips and gifs of the game they are currently working on, which has strong similarities to that of <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gamescom-hand-on-preview-surviving-together/">Little Nightmares</a>.</p>
<p>"Working with the Epic Games Publishing team has been an amazing experience for us," says Gustaf Heinerwall, Co-Founder of Section 9 Interactive. "Ever since our first meeting with the team at EGP we felt that this partnership was a perfect fit for our studio. They've given us incredible support and the freedom to fully explore our creative vision, which is all we can ask for in a publisher. We are thankful for this opportunity, and excited for what comes next."</p>
<p>By joining the <a href="https://wccftech.com/aquiris-studio-gets-investment-and-publishing-deal-from-epic-games/">publishing partnership</a> with Epic Games, the developers will still own their game's intellectual property rights while receiving funding for development costs, as well as support for when the game is ready to go to the market. During the development process, they will retain complete creative control of the project. Once the initial launch and costs of the game have been recouped, the developers will earn at least 50% revenue share.</p>
<p>Section 9 Interactive hopes to share more news about their upcoming project soon.</p>

			<p>The list of games and applications that feature RTX technologies continues to grow, with games having access to NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and advanced ray-tracing integration. This makes those who have GeForce RTX cards have a prettier and more immersive experience. With more than <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600 games and applications</a> utilizing these technologies, there is no sign of the list slowing down any time soon. This week, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-2-void-crew-towers-of-aghasba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three more games</a> joined the ever-expanding list, with more to come in the future. This week sees Void Crew, War Thunder and Towers of Aghasba join the list of games featuring<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-extensive-preview-of-nvidia-rtx-effects-and-performance/"> RTX technologies</a>. Below is a breakdown of how you can expect to utilize them in the game.</p>
<p>Void Crew has just been released from early access and is a fun co-op roguelite title from Hutlihut Games and Focus Entertainment where you get to play as a METEM-chosen clone warrior, where you and your friends have to embark on a Pilgrimage. As you explore and get deeper into the unknown, you come across the HOLLOW, an alien force like no other. It's up to you and your friends to face off against them to try and bring peace back to the people. Void Crew will be utilizing DLSS Super Resolution, allowing GeForce RTX gamers to accelerate the performance of the game with the advanced technology.</p>
<p>Next up on the list is War Thunder. This game is far from new, as it was first released in 2013. However, since its release, it's received a new coat of paint and looks better than ever. There are hundreds of tanks, ground military vehicles, planes, and warships that will look even better by using DLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA Reflex. War Thunder just received a new update, which also added support for hardware-accelerated ray-tracing effects to make the game even more immersive and stunning. These options include ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced water, and ray-traced shadows, for example.</p>
<p>Finally, Towers of Aghasba is the latest game to join the roster of games with RTX technology integration. This game is hot off the press and is currently in Early Access. In this game, you get to explore an open-world with fascinating flora and fauna. You will meet some interesting characters along the way, and you can help breathe life into the world, as well as create your very own island civilization. If you are playing this title, you will be able to use DLSS Super Resolution for a faster and smoother experience in Towers of Aghasba.</p>
