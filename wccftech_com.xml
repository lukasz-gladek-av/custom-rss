			<p>It's time for the first analyst reactions to the Nintendo Switch 2 announcements, starting with the higher-than-expected pricing for both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console itself</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its games</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-official-switch-2-going-pop-off-rhys-elliott--qtgbe/?trackingId=cnZA73cER1enucCFauha9Q%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to MIDiA Research's Rhys Elliott</a>, whom we often interviewed exclusively on Wccftech, the console is poised to become a smash hit even at the $450 price.</p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is slightly more expensive than many of us analysts thought, but $450 is still within the $400-500 price range I expected. While I still reckon $400 is the sweet spot, and we'll see a cheaper SKU eventually, $450 is still affordable and in line with other consoles and the Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p><em>Unlike other manufacturers, Nintendo relies almost solely on its console and console software business, so loss-leading pricing simply wasn’t in the cards. At $450, the Switch 2 is still cheap enough for mass-market adoption, and given the stacked and diverse software lineup, I believe it will sell well among core gamers, casuals, families, and more.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps an even tougher pill to swallow for consumers is the increase in Nintendo Switch 2 game prices, chiefly Mario Kart World, which will cost $80 (€90 in Europe) if you buy a physical copy. According to Elliott, the rationale is mainly to drive users to purchase digital instead, since Nintendo's split is currently around fifty-fifty (whereas the other consoles made by Microsoft and Sony already skew much more toward digital sales).</p>
<p><em>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">orange man’s tariffs</a> and Nintendo wanting to increase ARPPU factor into the reasoning behind Nintendo charging $80 for Mario Kart World, I think there’s more at play. </em><em>Nintendo also wants to nudge consumers to buy games digitally. The lower prices for digital games versus boxed (true for Donkey Kong and Mario Kart) point to this. Another factor is last week’s announcement of the Digital Game Card, which lets players ‘’lend games’’ to their Switch Online Family Plan members.</em></p>
<p><em>A little bit of context here: PlayStation and Xbox have already pushed their platforms to become digital-first, driven by strategies like multi-game subscriptions, digital-only consoles, free-to-play’s rise, and platform holders pushing consumers to digital versions via perks (like extra cosmetics and the ability to pre-load a game so it’s instantly ready to play at launch). </em><em>So PlayStation and especially Xbox are very digital-first. But Nintendo is different, more 50-50. </em></p>
<p><em>For consumers, a unique value proposition of physical games is the preowned and rental markets. But Nintendo’s reliance on physical impacts its bottom line, hence the nudging. </em><em>Nintendo does not gain revenues from physical renting and resales. After all, a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe could be sold on the reseller market 100 times or rented 100 times, but Nintendo would only capture revenues from that first sale. A digital-only market means more revenue and price control for Nintendo. Long story short, Nintendo’s use of framing (sticker shock for physical) is actually pushing people to digital, which benefits Nintendo.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-footage-no-dlss-ps4-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to support NVIDIA DLSS, as it is powered by NVIDIA technology, but the footage shown during yesterday's Direct does not indicate that it is being used.</p>
<p>In a new video going over some of the new Nintendo system's specs, the tech expert at Digital Foundry provided an early analysis of the game footage shown during the event, saying that there's no indication in the footage that NVIDIA DLSS was being used in any of the games, which is definitely surprising, although the footage shown could have been taken from early builds that haven't yet implemented the NVIDIA's upscaler. Interestingly enough, none of the Nintendo first-party titles seem to implement any sort of antialiasing, except for <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-4k-60-fps-nintendo-switch-2/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, continuing a trend that's been going on for a while.</p>
<p>In their early analysis of the Nintendo Switch 2 footage, Digital Foundry also provided pixel counts for several games, including<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/"> Mario Kart World</a>, which ran at 1440p resolution, 60 FPS, <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which ran at 1080p resolution, 60 FPS, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-upgraded-nintendo-switch-2-versions/">Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which both hit 1440p resolution, 60 FPS and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a>, which ran at 1080p resolution, 30 FPS. The most interesting pixel counts, however, are those of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/"> third-party ports</a> like Cyberpunk 2077, which ran at a resolution ranging from 540p to 1080p at 30 FPS, however, with much better image quality than on previous generation consoles, and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, which ran at 1080p resolution, 30 FPS, with much cleaner image quality than base PlayStation 4 but with some framepacing issues. Judging from the above, the Nintendo Switch 2 indeed offers a performance level in the ballpark of the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro, as speculated in the past, although there's no doubt that games launching past the console's release window will take better advantage of the system and push it further than the launch titles will do.</p>

<p>After the brief January reveal, the Nintendo Switch 2 was finally officially unveiled yesterday in the aforementioned Nintendo Direct. The presentation provided additional information on the system's screen, which will support 120 FPS gameplay as well as HDR, the new Joy-Con 2 functionality, and more. The console will launch on<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/"> June 5th</a> worldwide for $449.99 / €469.99.</p>

			<p>Amid the sea of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> news, there was also the <a href="https://x.com/ShinenGames/status/1907437680037646517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of FAST Fusion, a new entry in the zero-G racing series developed by Shin'en Multimedia, which will be a launch title for the new console. Interestingly, the previous installment (FAST RMX) was also a launch title for the first Switch. Then, the independent German developer did something with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Touryst</a>, an action/adventure game launched in 2020 on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>With FAST Fusion, the developer returns to creating exclusive games for a new Nintendo console, and it appears that they'll take full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2's capabilities. Here's an overview of the features confirmed by the studio:</p>
<p><strong><em>Hypersonic Speed</em></strong><br>
<em>The fastest racing game you may have ever experienced! Non stop adrenaline pumping action at 60 fps in up to 4K HDR.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Antigravity Jumps</em></strong><br>
<em>FAST Fusion vehicles are equipped with antigravity hyper jump technology. Cut corners and get ahead of your oppenents by jumping and boosting over them.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Vehicle Fusion</em></strong><br>
<em>Create hundreds of new Racing machines by fusing your favorite vehicles.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Hyper tracks</em></strong><br>
<em>Zoom through Redwood Forest, Alpine peaks, futuristic cities and many more breathtaking landscapes.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Motion Controls, HD Rumble</em></strong><br>
<em>Play with smooth motion controls, enjoy immersive HD Rumble and customize the buttons.</em></p>
<p>FAST Fusion will also support split-screen play for up to four players, the new Nintendo Switch 2 Game Share feature (both locally and online), TV Mode, Tabletop Mode, Handheld Mode, and, of course, the new Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2%E2%80%99s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trump%E2%80%99s-tariffs.1153791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tariffs announced by Donald Trump will drastically impact a number of industries across the world, and video games are in no way excluded. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-supply-chains-hit-with-up-to-a-46-percent-trump-tariffs/">Apple's</a> supply chain issues might not matter as much to gamers, what they likely care more about is the potential the tariffs have to raise the already high price of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo revealed its new console in an hour-long Nintendo Direct event on Wednesday, with the price of the console and the new games we'll be playing on it revealed immediately after. It'll be $449.99 USD if you want to just buy the console, or $499.99 USD to grab the bundle that includes the newly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-moves-some-switch-production-to-vietnam">2019</a>, Nintendo moved part of its hardware manufacturing out of China and into Vietnam and Cambodia. At the time, though it certainly looked like it, Nintendo stated that the move was not done as a means of avoiding tariffs during disputes between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The tariffs Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/trump-says-he-s-signing-executive-order-on-reciprocal-tariffs">announced later on Wednesday</a>, just hours after Nintendo's presentation, include a <strong>46%</strong> tariff levied against Vietnam and a <strong>49%</strong> tariff levied against Cambodia, both of which could end up impacting the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 on a global scale.</p>
<p>Trump also announced a base 10% tariff on all exporters to the United States that will go into effect this coming Saturday, April 5, 2025, while countries facing higher tariffs, like Cambodia and Vietnam, will have their tariffs go into effect on April 9, 2025. The 10% base tariff is also not being added to the ones Cambodia and Vietnam already face.</p>
<p>Unless some kind of deal is reached, including a lower tariff or an exception to certain exports to the United States, there's a very good chance the cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 could go higher than it already is.</p>
