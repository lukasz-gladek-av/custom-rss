			<p>Google's latest AI-based experiment, <strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/models/genie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Genie</a></strong>, has made a massive impression on users and investors alike. Google calls it a 'general purpose model' <strong>capable of swiftly creating photorealistic three-dimensional environments</strong> that can then be explored in a game-like fashion.</p>



<p>Anyone can test it out simply by writing a prompt. Of course, interaction is extremely limited: you can only move around and jump in these environments. Still, it is very impressive, to the point that <strong>it caused the stocks of many video game companies to crash</strong> as investors suddenly believed games would soon be made entirely with AI.</p>



<p><strong>Unity Technologies</strong>, the maker of the <strong>Unity Engine</strong> (one of the most used third-party game-making tools alongside <strong>Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>), went down by 18,80% yesterday. Epic Games is a private company, so it wasn't affected for obvious reasons.</p>



<p>Game developers and publishers also took a big hit. <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong>, the label behind Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, and NBA 2K, lost nearly 10%. <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>, the Polish developer behind The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077, fell by 8%. But <strong>Roblox Corporation</strong> had a sharper fall than both, losing over 13%.</p>



<p>Asian companies like <strong>CAPCOM</strong> or <strong>Tencent</strong> were barely affected, probably because the craze happened when their markets were already about to close on Friday. Still, this feels like a vast overreaction: Project Genie is just a glimpse into the future, rather than something anywhere near ready to replace properly made videogames.</p>



<p>Even so, Project Genie handles the rendering. Everything else would have to be added in by developers. That is, more or less, the vision <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a couple of years ago by NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, <strong>Bryan Catanzaro</strong></a>. Back then, the man behind DLSS imagined that <strong>DLSS "10"</strong> could render a game's entire visuals using AI-powered neural rendering, interfacing with a game engine to make it feel like an actual game. We might be heading toward that future, but there's no need for developers to fret - we'll still need them, that's for sure.</p>

<p>Then there's the other side of this kind of AI: how do you stop copyright infringement? People have already recreated virtual worlds inspired by <strong>SEGA's Sonic</strong> and <strong>Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda</strong> with Project Genie.</p>

<p>Of course, this would never fly outside of an experiment. If such technology were ever to be properly released, <strong>Google would need to implement strong guardrails to prevent the AI from directly infringing on copyrighted materials</strong>. Still, users would likely be able to create similar worlds while straying just far enough that the guardrails do not trigger.</p>
