			<p><strong>Amazon Prime Video</strong> has revealed our first look at <strong>Kratos</strong> and <strong>Atreus</strong> in the upcoming <strong>God of War TV</strong> series led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a></strong>, which we had previously learned was set to start filming in <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/"><strong>March 2026</strong>,</a> has already kicked off with actors <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/callum-vinson-will-play-atreus-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-show/"><strong>Callum Vinson</strong> </a>in full costume and makeup for their roles.</p>



<p>The image clearly depicts a scene from the very beginning of the <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> game, where Atreus and Kratos go hunting immediately after burning the ashes of Kratos' wife and Atreus' mom. Kratos is testing Atreus, to see if he is capable of making the journey that they are about to embark on to spread the ashes at the highest peak in all nine realms.</p>



<p>Of course, we know that the full journey encapsulates so much more than that, but as far as this first look goes, it's a pretty solid and iconic choice. The opening of the 2018 game is emotional and heavy, and this is a great callback to make for fans of the games, while also being a solid shot of the characters in their main roles of father and son.</p>

<p>With all of that said, the first comment under this photo, which is that this "<em>Looks like a cosplay from E3 2018</em>," and some of the other negative comments are not entirely out of line in their displeasure. God of War fans understand the importance of the scene, the costuming and makeup teams have clearly done a great job with getting everything about the look of Kratos and Atreus right, but at least in a single screenshot, it does not have the sense of magic and mythological wonder that the same scene in the game carries.</p>



<p>Maybe it's the fact that this is just a still image, with no music to support it, and that we have yet to hear how either actor sounds in these roles. Maybe once all those missing pieces are included, it'll actually look and feel how we might expect a God of War TV adaptation to look and feel.</p>



<p>Or maybe we'll start to see that when we see the rest of the cast in full makeup and costume. The most recent addition to the cast came earlier this week with <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-series-rebel-moons-ed-skrein-will-play-baldur/"><strong>Ed Skrein</strong> getting tapped to play <strong>Baldur.</strong></a> and now that the show has entered production, we'll hopefully soon learn who will be filling the last major role yet to be publicly revealed, <strong>Freya</strong>.</p>



<p>As a reminder, here's the list of the show's cast so far: </p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>

</ul>
