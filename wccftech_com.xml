			<p>Polish indie developer <strong>Paradark Studio</strong> is still working on its intriguing '<strong>CyberWestern</strong>' first-person action/adventure game <strong>ExeKiller</strong>. </p>



<p>Paradark shared an updated gameplay overview during today's <strong>New Game+ Showcase</strong>, reviving hopes in the project. The previous gameplay trailer was released in early 2023, while the debut trailer originally went live in late 2021, coinciding with the game's announcement.</p>



<p>In ExeKiller, you take on the role of <strong>Denzel Fenix</strong>, a licensed bounty hunter working for the powerful <strong>Helion Corporation</strong>. His job is straightforward: track fugitives and extract <strong>SOULs</strong>. SOULs are digital implants used to monitor and control the population.</p>



<p>In this world, survival doesn't come cheap. Players must constantly be aware of how they manage and carry their equipment, given the limited inventory space and high prices on essential supplies. <strong>The wasteland environment itself is a threat</strong>, with radiation zones, lethal sandstorms and extreme temperatures all potentially deadly to Denzel.</p>

<p>Firearms are an important part of the gameplay experience, but so is experimentation, according to the creators. <strong>Players can combine weapons, gadgets, environmental hazards and special abilities</strong> to approach encounters creatively or avoid combat altogether. Denzel can enhance his perception through cybernetic implants, allowing players to uncover hidden elements, piece together narrative clues, and read the environment, rather than relying on waypoints.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of ExeKiller is that <strong>missions are non-linear</strong>. There is no prescribed playstyle or guided solution; instead, players are given clear objectives, but are free to approach each contract through stealth, dialogue, direct combat, or a combination of all three. <strong>Not every job has to end with a kill</strong>. Paradark promises a choice-driven narrative where players shape NPC behaviour, dialogue and the broader narrative with their decisions, leading to multiple possible outcomes and endings.</p>



<p>The game is in development for PC, and you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1701840/ExeKiller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <strong>Steam</strong></a>. However, Paradark stated that console versions are planned as well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Epictellers Entertainment Debuts First Look at cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight Gameplay Ahead of Early Access Release in Summer 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-gameplay-debut-epictellers-entertainment-new-game-plus/</link>
            <guid>1401196</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Starfinder: Afterlight</strong> is a new turn-based cRPG from <strong>Epictellers Entertainment</strong>, a Barcelona-based studio that saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-qa-even-after-bg3-not-many-are-jumping-into-crpgs/">how Baldur's Gate 3 proved there was a commercial appetite for strong cRPG games</a>, and wanted to offer a sci-fi flavour to those fans of the genre and anyone introduced to cRPGs through Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Today, at the New Game Plus Showcase, Epictellers debuted a first look at some gameplay, including some combat and a bit of exploration. It's not a huge look at what's to come, but it does feature some stunning voices, and we now know that a demo is due to arrive soon, ahead of its early access release set for sometime in 2026.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-pc-early-access-release-date-2026/">It was unveiled last year</a>, with a 2026 release window for its early access release and a star-studded cast already attached to it, including another Baldur's Gate 3 connection with <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-features-voice-acting-from-neil-newbon-astarion-in-baldurs-gate-3/"><strong>Neil Newbon</strong></a> both voicing a character in the game and directing the rest of the cast. </p>



<p>Speaking of the rest of the cast, on top of Neil Newbon, players will be able to enjoy the dulcet tones of <strong>Roger Clark</strong> throughout the whole game as the narrator. Clark, who you'll know as the voice of Arthur Morgan in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, was picked specifically to help bring the western feel to the game that Epictellers Entertainment wanted Starfinder: Afterlight to have.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2025 dev commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mw-pPlhAHHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside Clark and Newbon are <strong>Fred Tatasciore</strong>, <strong>Inel Tomlinson, Melissa Medína, James Alexander,</strong> and <strong>Carolina Ravassa.</strong> You'd know Tatasciore from a slew of animated films and TV shows, but also games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. You'll have heard Tomlinson in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, Medína in Borderlands 4, The Mortuary Assistant, and Warframe: 1999, to name a few. While you'd recognize Alexander from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Horizon: Call of the Mountain, and Ravassa from Overwatch and Grand Theft Auto V. </p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight boasts a talent-rich cast, thanks in part to its successful Kickstarter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-80-mins/">which was funded in just 80 minutes </a>and ultimately <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description">surpassed its goal</a> by hundreds of thousands. Now that we know to expect a demo soon, hopefully, we'll also have a release date to look forward to not long after.</p>

			<p>2025 saw the return of one of the biggest strategy franchises in the genre, a spiritual successor to a series that fans are dying to see make a comeback, and a beloved game get its long-awaited remake. There was plenty to fill our pick of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/">Best Strategy and Simulation Games of 2025</a>, and if everything on our list below makes it out before the end of 2026, putting together 2026's list of the best strategy games and best simulation games shouldn't be an issue either.</p>

<h2 id="h-star-wars-zero-company-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Star Wars Zero Company (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Star-Wars-Zero-Company-Key-Art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bit Reactor</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you wanted to give someone the elevator pitch for Star Wars: Zero Company, telling them 'It's XCOM but make it Star Wars,' would be enough to get any strategy game player with a mild love for Star Wars through the door.</p>



<p>We can't be sure if it'll be that exact of a match-up whenever Star Wars: Zero Company does arrive on PC and current-gen consoles sometime in 2026, but it has the precedent to be. Bit Reactor was founded by former XCOM developers, with the studio led by Greg Foerstch, former art director at Firaxis on XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns. With so much XCOM blood in the studio, it's exciting to think of the kind of gameplay and storytelling we'll get, all set within the Star Wars universe. Hopefully, it makes its proposed 2026 window, and we're playing it before the end of the year.</p>



<h2 id="h-ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ace-Combat-8-Wings-of-Theve.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-announced-2026-launch-multiplayer-modes/">One of the bigger announcements of The Game Awards,</a> Bandai Namco's Ace Combat series is returning with Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve. It's not necessarily a jet flying simulator, but its simulation-style approach is what has it in our picks for what we're looking forward to from simulation games this year.</p>



<p>It's the first mainline entry in the series in seven years, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/">2019's Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-7-3-million-copies-sequel-in-development/">gone on to sell over 3 million copies since then</a>. It may not be the best-selling series in Bandai Namco's portfolio, but there's a clear hunger for more Ace Combat and millions of players who will happily buy this new entry when it arrives. Hopefully, we'll know more about the game and its release soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-total-war-warhammer-40-000-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Total-War-Warhammer-40K.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Total War series is hitting a couple of 'firsts' with the coming release of Total War: Warhammer 40,000. It'll be the first time the Total War series makes the trip to the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, but perhaps more importantly for the series, Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will be the first time the Total War series makes its way to consoles, as it is also set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/">The Game Awards 2025</a> with the help of David Harbour from Stranger Things, the coming game will feature the Space Marines, Orks, Aeldari, and Astra Militarum as its four factions, and while it doesn't have an official release window yet, the announcement did include gameplay footage which hopefully means its far enough along that we could see it arrive in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-tbc-2026-pc">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV (TBC 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Warhammer-40K-Dawn-of-War-IV.png"></a><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV. Image credit: Deep Silver</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>A second appearance from the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, though this time it's coming from its own series of RTS games instead of a different franchise making its first foray into the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The long-awaited Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV was shown off multiple times in 2025, including with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-stunning-in-engine-trailer/">an incredible-looking in-engine gameplay trailer</a> that made the game look like it was ready for release very soon.</p>



<p>It doesn't have an official release date or release window yet, but we'll hopefully be hearing more about it soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-nova-roma-march-26-2026-pc">Nova Roma (March 26, 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nova-Roma.png"></a><figcaption><em>Nova Roma. Image credit: Lion Shield</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last on our main picks is Nova Roma, a new upcoming title from developer Lion Shield and publisher Hooded Horse, the latter of whom has made a name for themselves as having a keen eye for upcoming strategy titles. </p>



<p>This city builder asks you to appease the Roman gods and create a successful and thriving Ancient Roman empire, and if you feel like <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> didn't scratch the Ancient Roman itch you have, then Nova Roma could be the game to do it. </p>


<div id="democracy-1517" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1517,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Most Anticipated Strategy and Simulation Game of 2026</strong></p></div>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>Of course, we can't have every upcoming game in our main picks, but the following games are still worth paying attention to.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cesar-winning-composer-amine-bouhafa-used-an-alien-instrument-to-help-capture-the-frozen-world-of-dont-nods-aphelion/</link>
            <guid>1401061</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>DON'T NOD has unveiled a new trailer for its upcoming game, <strong>Aphelion</strong>, at today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> which focused on the game's music and featured an interview with its award-winning composer, Amine Bouhafa.</p>



<p>You may have already heard Bouhafa's work in the 2021 short film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5030456/?ref_=fn_t_1">The Summit of the Gods</a> or in 2025's <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28326501/">The Little Sister</a>, though this is the first time the <strong>César-winning</strong> composer is working on a video game. "<em>This is my first time working on a video game, and I loved the way that [the Aphelion team] thought about the music and about the game. I'm enjoying the experience</em>," Bouhafa said in a press release.</p>



<p>Bouhafa narrates the trailer while gameplay from Aphelion is shown, as he describes how he approached writing the score for his first video game and how he used what he described as an "<em>alien instrument</em>" called a Cristal Baschet to capture the cold and frozen world of the game. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Aphelion | A Musical Journey - Amine Bouhafa" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkTMEg1x6Qc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>It is an instrument that had been invented by the Baschet brothers in the mid-20th century. For me, it looks like an alien instrument. When you see it, you cannot even predict that it's a musical instrument</em>," Bouhafa says. Playing the Cristal Baschet involves dipping your hands in water and then running them along several crystal batons to create its sound. For Bouhafa, it was the perfect element to "<em>convey the frozen identity of the score</em>."</p>



<p>Bouhafa also talks about using the grand organ at the Saint-Eustache Church in Paris, which helped convey the bigger, grander, and sacred moments in Aphelion's narrative. It's all together an interesting behind-the-scenes look at how a major aspect of Aphelion is coming together. </p>



<p>DON'T NOD has suffered a string of commercial misses lately, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/">last year's Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage missing expectations</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant both underperforming before that</a>. The studio does have a new game in the works with Netflix on top of Aphelion, which could prove fruitful, as it is based on "<em>a major IP</em>" within Netflix, but it'll be some time before that materializes into a full release - if Netflix even lets it get that far, since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">its willing involvement in video games seems iffy</a>, at best.</p>



<p>Aphelion is currently set to arrive sometime in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. It'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>
