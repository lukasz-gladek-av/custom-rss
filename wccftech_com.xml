			<p><strong>Split Fiction</strong> is one of the many video game-to-film or TV adaptations that <strong>Amazon</strong> has under its belt, and it appears that the adaptation starring <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/"><strong>Sydney Sweeney</strong> and directed by <strong>Jon M. Chu</strong></a> has hit a major milestone in the course of its production, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/"><strong>Hazelight </strong>boss <strong>Josef Fares</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezone</a> in a red carpet interview at the <strong>Guldbagge Awards</strong> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>), Fares confirmed that he had seen the first finalized version of the script, and confirmed that he's met Sydney Sweeney in a meeting, but he's not holding his breath about anything just yet. </p>



<p>"<em>I got the first version of the script today," </em>Fares told Moviezone<em>, "but you know, there’s so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this ‘I believe it when I see it.'</em>" Regarding Sweeney, Fares didn't have much to add beyond, "<em>I’ve had a meeting with her and she seems super chill</em>."</p>



<p>We first learned that a Split Fiction movie was in the works back in April 2025, but it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/">June 2025 that Amazon MGM won the bidding war</a> to get the film's production rights that it had found a home. Now, it has a script, and while there are plenty of steps to go before we can really start to look forward to the movie, it's better to hear some updates instead of nothing, which is currently the case with <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/">the <strong>It Takes Two </strong>film that was announced back in 2022,</a> and we haven't heard anything about it since.</p>



<p>Split Fiction isn't the only video game adaptation Sweeney is working on, as she's also signed on to <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">produce an adaptation of <strong>Out Run</strong> alongside <strong>Michael Bay</strong></a>. As for Amazon, it is currently days away from the premiere of the season two finale for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Fallout </strong>TV show adaptation</a>, and lately we've been hearing a lot about the cast for the coming <strong>God of War </strong>TV series, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Mandy Patinkin</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Teresa Palmer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Max Parker</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> all confirmed to be a part of the cast.</p>

			<p><strong>GameStop</strong> chief executive officer <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong> has the chance at a major, major payday if he can make good on a goal set for him by GameStop's board of directors. Amidst discovering that GameStop would be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/">shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</a></strong>, we also learned that if Cohen successfully turned the company that's worth a staggering <strong>$100 billion</strong>, then he would earn a <strong>$35 billion bonus</strong>. And now, it seems that Cohen has a plan on how to make that happen.</p>



<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/gamestop-ceo-plans-e8440c4b">Wall Street Journal</a>, the plan is essentially to buy his way to that growth by expanding beyond more than just being a video games retailer. Cohen plans to acquire a publicly traded company in a "<em>big</em>" deal, with the Journal identifying he'll be looking "<em>likely in the consumer or retail industry</em>."</p>



<p>On his plan, Cohen added, "<em>It's ultimately either going to be <strong>genius or totally, totally foolish</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Currently, GameStop is worth about <strong>$11 billion</strong>. To earn the full $35 billion bonus, Cohen would have to turn GameStop into a $100 billion market-cap company and reach a <strong>$10 billion</strong> EBITDA measure. Even when <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/">GameStop had its meteoric meme-stock rise back in 2021</a>, the company's market cap peaked at <strong>$33.7 billion</strong>, which falls more than a few billion short of Cohen's goal.</p>



<p>That said, the Journal's report adds that Cohen could still earn a partial bonus by increasing the company's market cap beyond <strong>$20 billion</strong> and reaching a <strong>$2 billion </strong>EBITDA measure. It won't be the full $35 billion, but if Cohen can manage to recreate some of the success that the company lucked into in 2021, he'll be able to take some sort of bonus home. </p>



<p>"<em>There are a lot of diamonds in the rough…that have sleepy management teams</em>," Cohen said about his plan and the layoffs GameStop has already been through. "<em>I didn’t fix GameStop to stop there</em>." The jury is still out as to whether Cohen did actually fix GameStop, which seems more interested <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">in making meme and troll-centred comments online</a> and closing stores than selling video games, but since Cohen did this interview with the Wall Street Journal, the company's stock was up <strong>3.5%</strong> this morning.</p>

			<p>A <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <strong>Baldur's Gate 3 mod</strong></a> aims to <strong>restore several deleted scenes</strong> from the game's early access version, which ran on PC for nearly three years before the full launch. Aptly titled '<strong>Early Access Scenes Restored</strong>', the mod created by Nexus user HyperspaceTowel has managed to reinject a lot of cut content and even create brand new cutscenes. Here's the overview:</p>



<ul>
<li>More NPC encounters and camp events</li>



<li>More companion reactivity</li>



<li>More approvals (or disapprovals)</li>



<li>Brand new content: some of the cutscenes were made from scratch</li>
</ul>



<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 mod adds back these NPCs and camp events:</p>



<ul>
<li>Visiting the camp for the first time</li>



<li>Enthralled fishermen</li>



<li>Nerela</li>



<li>Rurik</li>



<li>Seashell kid</li>



<li>Gale's deer stew</li>



<li>Gale's loss</li>



<li>Post-Druid civil war</li>



<li>Shadowheart's ultimatum</li>



<li>Ceremorphosis beckons...</li>
</ul>



<p>Several of the companions already available in the game's first Act, like Astarion, Gale, Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Karlach, and Wyll, now react to specific story events once again. The modder also claims to have reworked some scene cinematics to improve the camera work and timing. Some Early Access cut lines were spliced into the full release dialogues, some Origin dialogue options were added here and there, and brand new scenes were created for Wyll and Karlach.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to the modder, there's still more cut Baldur's Gate 3 content to restore, including Thralls on the Nautiloid, even more Wyll and Karlach reactivity, and additional voiced dialogue for Tav.</p>



<p>In other Baldur's Gate 3 news, earlier this month, <strong>Larian</strong> CEO <strong>Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-would-have-loved-baldurs-gate-3-switch-2-wasnt-our-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented on the lack of a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version</a>. He said the developer would have loved to port the game to the hybrid console, hinting that the reason it doesn't exist is due to the IP owner, <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>.</p>
