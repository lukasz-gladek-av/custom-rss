			<p>Sony is reportedly in the initial stages of developing a new PlayStation 5 handheld console that will compete directly with the Nintendo Switch. The surprising news comes from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, which cites anonymous sources and also clarifies that the plans have not been finalized. The console may not even ever make it to the market. This puts it roughly on par with what we know about Microsoft's Xbox handheld. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it is being made but also added it is years away.</p>
<p>Sony has a long history of making PlayStation handhelds, of course. The first one they produced was the PlayStation Portable, colloquially known as PSP, which launched between late 2004 and early 2005 across the world as a competitor to the Nintendo DS. The PSP was well received and Sony managed to sell a lot of units (76.4 million units as of 2012, the latest public figure), although not nearly as many as the Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>They tried again with the PlayStation Vita, which debuted between late 2011 (Japan) and 2012 (North America and Europe). However, the PS Vita was, by and large, a commercial failure, leading to the decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-stopped-first-party-titles-ps-vita/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandon</a> first-party game development for the platform in 2015.</p>
<p>Sony kind of revived its handheld tradition with the PlayStation Portal, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> earlier this year to seemingly solid sales. However, the Portal is only dedicated to streaming games via cloud. Interestingly, the Bloomberg article reports that was not always the case, as Sony had previously considered making it more like Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> by Moore's Law Is Dead earlier this year suggests that Sony would once again partner with AMD on this new hardware. That report mentioned compatibility with both PS4 and PS5 games, although Bloomberg only mentions that it will be a PlayStation 5 handheld. The latter option seems more likely: considering that the hardware is still a few years away, supporting PlayStation 4 games wouldn't really make sense at that point.</p>

			<p>Following the good news that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> one million units sold (not counting all Game Pass users who are playing the game), the Ukrainian development team has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outlined</a> the main fixes that will be released with the first post-launch update. The game is rather buggy and unbalanced, so, understandably, they will focus on these areas first.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Crash Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Issues and memory allocation failures, which previously caused the game to exit unexpectedly, particularly around rendering, skeletal meshes, and quest-related cutscenes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Main Quest Progression Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Several bugs blocking the main quest progression, NPCs getting stuck in objects, incorrect quest markers, and issues with quest cutscenes.</em><br>
<em>Revision of the main quests (like Visions of Truth or A Minor Incident) to ensure smooth transitions, avoiding rare cases of players not being able to proceed further.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Gameplay &amp; Balance Adjustments, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Fixing the price of the weapons with upgrades installed compared to their value without attachments.</em><br>
<em>NPCs behavior, including the way they act when lacking a shelter during the Emissions.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cutscenes &amp; Visual Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Rarely missing facial animations, misplaced NPCs, and visual inconsistencies like detached heads and clothes clipping.</em><br>
<em>Quality and stability improvements of the visual effects.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Softlock Fixes, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Issue where players were unable to close the trade screen after putting ammo in a wrong slot while playing on a gamepad.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>User Interface Improvements, including:</strong></em><br>
<em>Quest notifications now showed correctly during dialogues.</em><br>
<em>Corrected texts and missing interaction prompts.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Noted to be addressed in future updates:</strong></em><br>
<em>Analogue sticks dead zones bugfixes.</em><br>
<em>A-Life system bugfixes.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my take</a> on STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl:</p>
<p><em>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</em></p>
