			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will not be a massive problem for ports and multiplatform games, as additional optimization work will get these games running decently on the system.</p>
<p>Famiiboards user MattAgain, who is a known developer who has worked in the video game industry for a long time and provided some valuable insights in the past, recently <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the newly revealed system, highlighting how the Switch 2 CPU, while being the part that deviates the most from the standard set by the system overall, is not going to be cause of concern for developers, as no one making a Switch 2 game from the ground up is complaining about it. The only small complaints have come from developers working on ports, which will apparently require a bit more CPU optimization work, compared to how relatively easily graphical resources can scale to the GPU. This additional CPU optimization work, however, isn't anything that shouldn't be expected, going from a power-hungry x86 to a mobile ARM CPU. So, for the time being, the system's CPU shouldn't be an impediment, and, as a whole, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1572486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porting</a> a PlayStation 5 game to the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be much easier than porting a PlayStation 4 game to the original Switch, which is great news.</p>
<p>The fact that porting games to the Nintendo Switch 2 should be easier than porting games to its predecessor is definitely great news, as this should allow third-party developers to support the system with ease. Very few games have been confirmed for the new Nintendo consoles, but according to rumors, plenty of big publishers are looking into supporting the console heavily, such as Microsoft, who is reportedly working on ports of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">Diablo IV, Fallout 4 and even Starfield</a>. According to a recent report, basically, every third-party developer is considering supporting the system with their most ambitious AAA titles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-mmo-by-ncsoft-may-have-been-canceled-according-to-a-new-report.1087545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-canceled/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Horizon MMO that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/">reportedly</a> in the works by Korean development studio NCSoft may have been canceled alongside other projects, according to a new report that's been making the rounds.</p>
<p>Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MTN</a> shared an exclusive report last week, as posted on<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ResetERA</a>, which confirms how some of the studio's projects, which include Project H, the Horizon MMO, have stopped development following a feasibility review. Developers assigned to these projects, according to MTN, were notified about the end of development and to prepare for internal transfers late last year and at the beginning of 2025. Some of these canceled projects have also disappeared from the company's organizational charts, so it definitely looks like development has been terminated for good.</p>
<p>As the Horizon MMO was never formally announced, it is unlikely that an announcement will be made regarding the end of development. Still, this is definitely not a good look for Sony right now, whose push into live service games seems to have only brought disastrous results, with the failed launch of Concord last year and the recent cancelation of two other games in development by Bluepoint Games, who was developing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War live service game</a>, and Bend Studio. The Horizon multiplayer game, whose first look came with some leaked footage back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/">2023</a>, on the other hand, is still in development, so Sony is still going ahead with expanding the franchise beyond the single-player boundaries set by the first two main entries in the series.</p>

			<p>There are some major strategy and simulation games that will be released this year, including the eagerly-awaited release of Civilization VII. If you're looking for a new strategy or simulation game, you'll want to keep your eyes on some of the titles on this list that are set to be released later this year. Without further ado, here are Wccftech's five most anticipated strategy and simulation games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Civilization VII (February 11, 2025)</h2>
<p>The year is starting off really strong with <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization VII</a> from Firaxis. For some, it may feel like Civilization VI was released just a couple of years ago, but it was actually launched in 2016. Now, we are seeing a new era of Civ, with the latest game in the franchise set to be released on February 11, 2025. This game will be widely available, with those on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and even Nintendo Switch able to get it in the future. For those who have pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition or the Founder's Edition, you'll get access to this title a full five days before the full release of the game, getting an advantage over those who will be waiting for the official release date, especially if you plan to play against them in multiplayer. You can check out the official PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-system-requirements-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Two Point Museum (February 27, 2025)</h2>
<p>The Two Point franchise has had some fantastic games, including Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus. The latest iteration in the franchise allows you to become a museum owner, and is set to be the most ambitious in the franchise. For those who enjoyed the previous games in the franchise, you'll definitely want to keep your eye on this one. Especially if you've had dreams of owning your own museum, this will allow you to do just that. Two Point Museum is set to release on February 27 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Football Manager 25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>If playing the actual game of football doesn't do it for you, but you enjoy the management of creating your own teams and having them compete, Football Manager is the way to go. The game was originally set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-announced-launches-november-26/">release last year</a> as usual, being an annual series, but has since been delayed by the developers, with the game now set to release sometime in March. For those interested, Football Manager 25 will be released on most systems, including the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and even the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Alliance of the Sacred Suns (2025)</h2>
<p>If you enjoy a 4X Strategy game set in space, then you'll want to keep your eyes peeled on Alliance of the Sacred Suns. It begins with your coronation as the new head of an empire, with the game ending when you die. Between the start and the end, you have a lot of major choices to make to ensure the survival of yourself as well as your empire. There are feuding houses, attempts at usurping the throne, and much more to keep you on your toes. At the moment, this game doesn't have a set release date but is due to come out later in 2025.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Commandos: Origins (March 2025)</h2>
<p>Commandos: Origins is that perfect hit of nostalgia that is set to be released later this year. This game is a long-awaited sequel in the Commandos franchise, a series that hasn't received a new release since 2006. There have been HD remasters of some of the classics in 2022, but this is a brand-new story that takes you back to the start of the elite force, where you get to experience their origin stories for the first time. It's set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in March; meanwhile, you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-demo-released-for-pc-and-xbox-series-sx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> check out a demo</a> (available only on PC and Xbox).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nacon-announces-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-expecting-switch-2-release-between-april-and-september/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new report, NACON has announced their accessories that have been created with the Nintendo Switch 2 in mind. Just last week, people finally got their first look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">long-awaited Nintendo Switch 2</a>. While it didn't reveal many details, it has been confirmed that people will get more information about the upcoming console in April thanks to a special Nintendo Direct dedicated to the console. NACON is a French publisher and accessory creator and has confirmed that it already has a bunch of peripherals for gamers to purchase when the Nintendo Switch 2 officially releases.</p>
<p>While we don't know the official release date yet of the console, NACON is expecting a significant rise in sales in the first half of the fiscal year of 2025/26, as that is when they are expecting the official release of the Nintendo Switch successor. In the report, they have also confirmed that they have a number of games ready to be published for the Nintendo Switch 2. This information comes from a snippet of the <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1881421491285393857/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report posted on X by MauroNL</a>, which you can read for yourself on their social media.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can see the line-up of accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2 on the official NACON website, where you can see everything from foldable driving wheels to carrying cases and tempered glass protectors. So far, there are 16 items listed on the website, all for very reasonable prices. While they can't be purchased yet, they will be open to purchase as soon as the Switch 2 releases.</p>
<p>It's likely that once the console releases, NACON will continue to make even more products for the console, including themed accessories such as Mario and Zelda-themed items.</p>
<p>In the snippet of the report posted by MauroNL, NACON says that their business levels will be boosted thanks to the games and accessories that were created in 2024/25 but weren't released in that period and will instead be released in 2025/26. There will also be a NACON Connect Event taking place on March 6, where they will be showcasing some of the games that they have planned for this year. According to the post, they have 10 new games ready to be published, which will all be released at different points throughout the year. The most significant games out of the bunch will be revealed during their special event on March 6.</p>
