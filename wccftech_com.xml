			<p>Amazon's God of War TV series is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">set to start filming in March 2026</a> after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/">show was rebooted with Ronald D. Moore</a> now at the helm as showrunner. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/">Deadline</a> reveals that Amazon has ordered two seasons of the show, and that the first two episodes of season one will be directed by Emmy award-winning director Frederick E.O. Toye of Shogun and The Boys.</p>



<p>Moore is still leading the charge on the show as its showrunner, writer, and executive producer, but Toye will take the directing reins for the first two episodes, the two episodes that, arguably more than the ones that will follow, will set the tone for the series.</p>



<p>Deadline's report also adds that, ahead of filming in March, the show has already started pre-production in Vancouver. It's currently unclear what elements of the God of War series the show will pull from, though we know that the show will pull from God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok, rather than the original Greek mythology-focused God of War games.</p>



<p>Casting for Kratos and Atreus is currently underway, as the big question around the show is who will be chosen to fill those iconic roles. Christopher Judge, who plays Kratos in the new rebooted version of God of War, has previously talked about throwing his hat in the ring, but also adds that he has no animosity towards whoever gets the role. </p>
