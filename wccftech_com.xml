			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond may finally be on its way to gamers. The <span>South Korean rating board, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank">GRAC</a>&nbsp;(Game Rating and Administration Committee), has just rated the game</span>, hinting at a relatively close release date.</p>



<p>The GRAC has often 'leaked' release date announcements. For example, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its rating on February 6, and the game's launch date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> around one month later, on March 9. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was then released on June 26.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4's launch date could therefore be announced in the coming weeks, whether at a Nintendo Direct, Gamescom, or even the Tokyo Game Show, for a late 2025 launch. Of course, an early 2026 date is also entirely possible.</p>



<p>Either way, this listing seemingly contradicts a rumor pushed a few hours ago by Reece 'KiwiTalks' Reilly, who <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1947809648700002346#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> there was no official release date because the game still wasn't finished. That seems highly unlikely given that the GRAC already put out its rating.</p>



<p>By the way, the game was rated '12 years old and up' by the South Korean rating board:</p>



<p><em>A first-person adventure game set on the planet Buros, where Samus Aran was transferred after an unexpected situation arose following her encounter with Silux at a Galactic Federation research facility.</em></p>



<p><em>Mild violence (using weapons attached to the suit to attack alien lifeforms).</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's development was very troublesome. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the original Nintendo Switch in June 2017. Back then, it had been assigned to an external studio, Bandai Namco, but their work did not satisfy Nintendo. The Japanese company decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot the project</a> and hand it back to the historic Metroid Prime caretaker: Retro Studios.</p>



<p>Now, at long last, the finishing line appears to be in sight. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to play the game</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event and came away rather positive about it:</p>



<p><em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also be available for the original Switch, by the way, as per the original announcement.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Devs Went to Square Enix’s Final Fantasy Office for a ‘Creatively Rich Exchange of Ideas’]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix%E2%80%99s-final-fantasy-office-for-a-%E2%80%98creatively-rich-exchange-of-ideas%E2%80%99.1253046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Some of the key developers behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 have visited Square Enix's offices to meet with the Final Fantasy team. The confirmation <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1948389582665547854?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came</a> from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, who posted a picture of the two groups posing with a Cloud Strife standee.</p>



<p>According to Hamaguchi-san, the two groups engaged in a 'creatively rich exchange of visions and ideas' during the meeting. This will no doubt fuel Final Fantasy fans' hopes that Square Enix might reconsider its stance on turn-based combat.</p>



<p>The most recent games in the franchise have effectively shunned the traditional combat system in favor of action-based combat, as seen in Final Fantasy XVI, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> back in 2022 that the ever-improving realistic graphics was making it increasingly harder for some gamers to accept the inherently not-so-realistic nature of turn-based combat.</p>



<p>However, the success story of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proves that wrong</a>. Granted, Square Enix would have much higher sales targets for mainline Final Fantasy titles, and Sandfall Interactive's game doesn't use a traditional turn-based system anyway (dodges and parries are performed in real-time). Even so, it's obvious there is a market for this, as shown even by Baldur's Gate 3. Even though that was a Western cRPG, it still used turn-based combat mixed with fairly realistic graphics (perspective notwithstanding) to enormous acclaim.</p>



<p>Did Square Enix ask Sandfall Interactive for tips on how they made it work? Or, better yet, did they discuss a potential partnership on a new project? Co-development is all the rage nowadays throughout the gaming industry, so we wouldn't be surprised at all.</p>



<p>Of course, even if that were the case, it would be a long way from releasing. Nevertheless, it'll be interesting to see whether Square Enix eventually relents to fans to provide a new game with at least the option to play with turn-based fights.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Story of The Last of Us Part I and II Will Be Available in Book Form Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/story-the-last-of-us-available-book-form/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-story-of-the-last-of-us-part-i-and-ii-will-be-available-in-book-form-later-this-year.1253001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you cannot stand video games and TV shows and would like to know what all the fuss regarding The Last of Us is about, the entire story so far will be available in book form later this year. Of course, it's also a perfectly valid option for those who already know the story through different mediums and would like to read it from the perspective of script writers Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross (the latter worked just on Part II).</p>



<p>The hardcover is already available for pre-order <a href="https://amzn.to/46WmXgE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Amazon</a>. It is estimated to be released on December 16, and the price of $69.99 is currently discounted to $66.63 (5% off). Dark Horse Books publishes the book, which is 616 pages long.</p>



<p>Here's the product overview:</p>



<p><em>Join Joel and Ellie from the very beginning of their unforgettable journey. Relive every climactic moment from The Last of Us Part I, from the duo’s time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie’s joy while petting giraffes, to Joel’s heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies’ hospital. And dive into The Last of Us Part II’s dual-perspective story, including Abby’s shocking introduction to the story, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby.</em></p>



<p><em>This volume contains the script from both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II, as well as the DLC, Left Behind, so you can experience every bottle thrown, every bad pun of Ellie’s, and every heart-pounding encounter with the Infected in a totally new way. Much like Savage Starlight was to Ellie, The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts is a must-have for any fan’s bookshelf (or survival kit).</em></p>



<p>The book also includes an art gallery featuring work by Naughty Dog principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, a buckram-textured cover, and block printing along the pages' edges that evokes the iconic Cordyceps fungus of The Last of Us.</p>



<p>The story as-is can be considered complete. As we previously reported, creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a third game would only be produced if Naughty Dog found a worthy story. Druckmann himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped back</a> from his additional role as co-showrunner of the HBO series, although HBO reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbo-not-concerned-neil-druckmann-departure-the-last-of-us-show-16-emmy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn't concerned</a> about his departure. Even so, the second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw a large decline </a>in viewership, and fans fear the third season will be even worse without the creator's handiwork.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Recently Canceled a Star Wars Outlaws Sequel – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-recently-canceled-a-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-%E2%80%93-rumor.1252920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This month, just days prior to the time of this writing, Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/"> Star Wars Outlaws missing its sales targets on the Star Wars IP itself</a>, saying that the Star Wars brand was "<em>in choppy waters</em>" at the time of Outlaws' launch. Now, a rumor has surfaced that Ubisoft has quietly canceled a Star Wars Outlaws sequel. </p>



<p>The rumor comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bFaIYn9H3g&amp;t=2800s">Tom Henderson and Insider-Gaming</a>, who said on the website's podcast that Ubisoft "<em>recently canceled Star Wars Outlaws 2</em>," adding that it was still in its early stages and that it "<em>hadn't entered [full] production</em>," and that it was "<em>very, very, early</em>." Mike Straw, senior editor at the site, joked that we were "<em>probably seven years away</em>" from seeing it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Is EA's Last Chance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFaIYn9H3g?start=2800&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Henderson has <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">previously correctly reported</a> internal information about Ubisoft, but this claim remains a rumor for now. It's also arguably not the most wild speculation. You could say that Outlaws was the biggest miss for Ubisoft in 2024, a year rife with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/09/skull-and-bones-looks-like-its-doing-worse-than-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">big misses</a> for the company. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">struggled to move units out of the gate</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">underwent significant changes from its original launch version</a> months after release due to a heavy wave of negative player feedback. The game's director even acknowledged <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">disappointment with the response from critics</a>.</p>



<p>Its poor launch sales were also used as an excuse to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows out of 2024 and to its eventual March 2025 launch date. You could make the case that Ubisoft has had anything but negative things to say about Outlaws since it launched. It's not the craziest idea that leadership ultimately decided not to go down the road of a sequel, even if they were exploring what one would look like.</p>
