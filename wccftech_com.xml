			<p>Apple <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-announces-ios-26-with-new-glass-dsign-updated-features-more/">unveiled</a> its new Liquid Glass redesign for its entire product line, and to be fair, the updates are quite significant, not just when it comes to looks but functionality as well. While the design of iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26 is pretty neat that takes into account different layers of digital glass that refract light differently, it would be unfair to point out that Windows did it first. Moreover, Samsung wasted no time in reminding Apple that it, too, had already used glass in its UI.</p>
<h2>Apple‚Äôs Liquid Glass UI for iOS 26, macOS Tahoe faces Samsung, Windows jabs over design originality, AI features</h2>
<p>Samsung has always stood on top when it comes to poking Apple for its design, whether its hardware or software, and iOS 26 is no exception. The Cupertino tech giant calls its new 'Liquid Glass' UI design language 'expressive,' which sounds a bit too familiar, as Google recently announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-releases-android-16-qpr1-beta-1-for-pixel/">Material 3 Expressive design</a> for Android 16, which kind of follows the same glass approach. Samsung was quick to notice and posted its insights mockingly on X.</p>
<p>The South Korean giant first poked fun at the "sleek glass UI" of iOS 26 by referencing its own One UI 7 redesign. One UI 7 is pretty reminiscent in this regard, and while the approach and mechanics behind the design could be different, the general visuals appear to be pretty similar.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Customizable apps? Floating bars? That sleek glass UI? Looks‚Ä¶ familiar ü§î</p>
<p>‚Äî Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungMobileUS/status/1932126084641718633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Samsung stated that its One UI 7 update launched with some of Apple's new AI features first, including Live Translations across Messages, FaceTime, and the Phone apps. This feature was introduced with the Galaxy S24 lineup last year, and now they are available on additional devices. Samsung also took a dig at Apple for just adding AI features to the Apple Watch, like Workout Buddy and other minor additions. Samsung says that it has used AI on its Galaxy Watch models for a while, and while it is not something to brag about, the company is the first to adopt the technology.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">New to live translations? Welcome aboard! We‚Äôve been translating text and speech in real-time for a while now‚Ä¶ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyAI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GalaxyAI</a></p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">AI is coming to your watch? Cute. Ours already knows when you‚Äôre too tired to care üò¥ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyAI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GalaxyAI</a></p>

<p>Samsung may have used AI and glass UI in its products first, but Apple's implementation is quite different, and the usability might vary as well. If you think this is it, <a href="https://wccftech.com/macos-tahoe-brings-liquid-glass-ui-new-spotlight-games-app-more/">macOS Tahoe 26</a> has also been mocked for its Windows Vista-like design language.</p>
<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/06/10/apple-innovates-windows-vista-aero-glass-with-macos-26-liquid-glass-oh-well/">Windows Latest</a></em>, macOS Tahoe 26 and Windows Vista share various similarities, not just the visuals. Apple says the macOS Tahoe ‚Äúis crafted with Liquid Glass, a translucent new material that reflects and refracts its surroundings.‚Äù On the flip side, Microsoft describes Aero Glass in Windows Vista as "providing spectacular visual effects such as glass-like interface elements that you can see through.‚Äù</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The publication also states that macOS Tahoe uses soft tints and depth layers for folders and apps, which is pretty similar to how Vista worked with color-based transparency effects. You can read the full piece for more details on the design of both software updates.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There is no first-mover advantage when it comes to design; it just looks good and is totally up to the user how he sees it. Apple's rendition is neat and new for the company and its user base, which makes all the difference. How did you like the new Liquid Glass redesign? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-microsd-m-2-adapter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 MicroSD Express to M.2 open-source adapter is in the works, potentially allowing users to get more storage space at a lower price.</p>
<p>The project's <a href="https://github.com/NVNTLabs/switch2-SDEX2M2/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, which was launched this week, provided the first information on the process, revealing that such an adapter is made possible because the console's MicroSD Express slot supports the SD Express 7.1 standard, which exposes a true PCIe Gen3 x1 interface and utilizes the NVMe protocol for communication. As such, the adapter maps PCIe x1 from the Switch 2‚Äôs MicroSD Express slot to a standard M.2 2230 NVMe SSD, and no protocol translation is required as the Nintendo Switch 2 host controller handles everything.</p>
<p>Currently, the project's development seems to be proceeding smoothly, and the team is actively developing the PCB layout and testing. While the adapter, on paper, should be working without any issue, the team warns that there's the possibility of power-related issues related to the power draw of the M.2 SSD, which could be more than the Nintendo Switch 2 could handle, so a basic level of power filter has been added to hopefully establish a connection. Still, it is advised only to use low-voltage M.2 2230 NVMe drives and not attempt to use the adapter on legacy MicroSD slots, such as those of the original Nintendo Switch systems.</p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 will not be remembered as an innovative gaming system, it is an excellent console and a clear upgrade from its predecessor. You can learn more about the new generation system from Nintendo in Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode.1214229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the main advancements of the Nintendo Switch 2 is its support for High Dynamic Range displays. This works in both handheld mode, thanks to the console's own display, and TV mode, when the console is connected to an external display.</p>
<p>Granted, the console's display was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> to be severely lacking in HDR capabilities. The edge-lit LCD can only output 450 nits at maximum, which is nowhere near what's needed to display a proper HDR image. Moreover, being an LCD, the Nintendo Switch 2 display cannot provide anywhere near the same contrast level as an OLED display.</p>
<p>This limitation will only be overcome when the inevitable OLED Switch 2 releases in the future. Meanwhile, users can still access a better HDR experience in TV mode, provided they have a capable HDR display. However, Nintendo's HDR calibration settings menu isn't exactly user friendly.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhFXc_iKIMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> out by YouTuber My Life in Gaming, after adjusting the peak brightness setting, there is another prompt that can be triggered with the Y button that brings the user to another brightness slider. This is, however, the paper white slider, which is completely different than the peak brightness slider, as HDR-savvy users already know.</p>
<p>As such, if your HDR is overblown, tweaking this setting may help. The YouTuber brought the slider below the midpoint and noticed improvements in midtones, shadows, and even menus with HDR enabled in Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hidden Switch 2 Setting Fixes HDR Calibration! / MY LIFE IN GAMING" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhFXc_iKIMg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another 'tip' is that you should always enable HGIG in your display's options. The HDR Gaming Interest Group was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr-gaming-interest-group-formed-optimize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> nearly seven years ago to optimize HDR gaming content across various displays. When HGIG is enabled, a display's dynamic tone mapping is disabled, preserving the creator's intent and delivering an optimal HDR image.</p>
<p>Granted, even with these two tweaks, Nintendo's first-party games don't look that much better in HDR on the Nintendo Switch 2. It's clear they still have to learn how to optimize their games for the format. Still, you'll get the optimal HDR image for third-party games.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 will launch later this month, introducing returning monster Lagiacrus, new features, and balance changes to the game.</p>
<p>The game's second major update has yet to receive a precise launch date, but it's been confirmed on the game's official Japanese X account that it will be released at the end of June. Full patch notes will be coming closer to the update's launch, but we already know the update will introduce Monster Hunter Tri's beloved monster Lagiacrus, which is expected to be somewhat reworked like it was in Generations due to the lack of underwater combat, a layered weapon system and some balance changes for specific weapons, including hammer and dual blades.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched earlier this year on PC and consoles, and has definitely moved the series' formula forward by introducing some open-world mechanics that allow hunters to always stay out in the field and go after the monsters that appear on the maps as time passes. You can check out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review</a> to learn why I think the latest entry in the series is one of the best Monster Hunter games to date.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
