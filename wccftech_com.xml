			<p>Almost five years after its debut on PlayStation 5, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</a></strong> is finally hitting other consoles next month with a release on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S, allowing more users to enjoy the first entry in the trilogy. Ahead of the new ports release, Square Enix has released a playable demo today, which also serves as yet another great showcase of what the Nintendo Switch 2 can do with dedicated optimization taking full advantage of the system's capabilities.</p>



<p>The demo allows players to experience the iconic bombing mission, accompanying Cloud Strife and Barret Wallace as they set out to destroy one of the Mako reactors powering the city of Midgar, ruled by the Shinra Electric Power Company. Any progress made in the demo on both <strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.xbox.com/it-IT/auth/msa?action=logIn&amp;returnUrl=%2Fit-IT%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-demo%2F9NFTWDJKGSBF&amp;prompt=none">Xbox Series X|S</a></strong> can be transferred to the full game when it launches next month, and all those importing a demo save file can claim the bonus items <em>"Revival Earrings"</em> and <em>"Survival Set"</em>.</p>

<p>With so many multiplatform games targeting both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there's little doubt that Microsoft's consoles should be able to handle Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade well. As such, there's obviously more curiosity surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 version, and the demo confirms that the new generation Nintendo console will deliver a more than playable experience, featuring great image quality that's almost on par with the PlayStation 5 release, judging from the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976008"><strong>first screenshots</strong></a> shared on <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976341">ResetERA</a></strong> by user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/often-ignored-bear.51892/"><strong>Often Ignored Bear</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With such outstanding image quality on display, the community consensus on this port is unanimous. "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Played through it just now in handheld. This looks nearly identical to how Intergrade looks on a base PS5 in Quality Mode. The hair has some dithering at times but looks fine overall. This is an INCREDIBLE port," </em>said ResetERA forums member <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148978135">Neiteio</a></strong>, echoing a widespread sentiment among fans.</p>



<p>The launch of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S will mark the beginning of a year very likely filled with Final Fantasy VII news. According to director Naoki Hamaguchi, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a name for the final entry in the trilogy will be decided before the end of the year</strong></a>, suggesting that the game's first reveal has a very high chance of happening in 2026. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few months ago, developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-20-million-players-dead-island-3-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of Dead Island 3 as they celebrated the second installment reaching 20 million players (including those who played through subscription services and even those who <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grabbed it for free from the Epic Games Store MEGA Sale</a> earlier this year).</p>



<p>Now, though, Internet spotter extraordinarie Timur222 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pucmqonvvkskre2rhfmckaob/post/3ma3mavhny225?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncovered</a> from Dambuster's financial statements that the UK studio is targeting Q1 or Q2 2028 as the launch window for Dead Island 3. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>Dambuster Studios is a AAA video game developer based in Nottingham which has 194 employees (as of March 2025). 93% are working in development and the remaining staff are studio management and administrative support. After the release of Dead Island 2 Ultimate Edition in October 2024, the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3. All developers are assigned to the project, and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete, all of Dambuster's QA team will also be assigned to Dead Island 3. Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace. The current predicted release window for the project is Q1/2 2028.</em></p>



<p>Dead Island 2 launched on April 21, 2023, which means that Dead Island 3 will be out in less than five years, provided there are no delays on the schedule.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 took a long time to be released. It was first in development by Yager, which showcased the game with a playable demo at Gamescom 2014. However, publisher Deep Silver was not satisfied with the developers' direction for the project and removed Yager from it. In March 2016, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Sumo Digital would make the game. Three and a half years later, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassigned</a> to Dambuster Studios, an internal Deep Silver studio.</p>



<p>With so many developer changes, there was widespread skepticism about the final game's quality, but Dambuster <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a fun experience</a> that resonated with fans, convincing Deep Silver to assign Dead Island 3 as the studio's next project.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One of the surprises of The Game Awards 2025 (well, I should say up to a few hours before the event, since the announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leak-suggests-game-is-a-remake-of-the-first-installment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked beforehand</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. Fans of the most famous gaming heroine knew that Crystal Dynamics was working on a new game, which was indeed unveiled at the show, but the remake of the beloved first entry in the action/adventure series was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will offer Lara Croft fans a chance to experience some of the old-school magic in 2026, on the 30th anniversary of the franchise, leaving Crystal Dynamics a bit more time to release the new entry in 2027. The game is being co-developed with Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind Hard Reset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-warrior-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow Warrior</a>, Trek to Yomi, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/evil-west-ungodly-hand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evil West</a>.</p>



<p>The Italian website Multiplayer <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis-passato-futuro-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the chance to interview two key developers from Crystal Dynamics</a>, Game Director Will Kerslake and Studio Head Scot Amos, following the TGA 2025 announcement. Speaking about Legacy of Atlantis, they said:</p>



<p><em><strong>Scot Amos:</strong> We want to honor the original DNA of Core Design, but through the lens of the modern gamer.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Will Kerslake:</strong> The realities of 1996 and 2026 are different. We want Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to evoke the same feelings as the first time you played it, but it must be a modern game experience when you play it. We kept the confident Lara and most of the puzzles, but had to completely rebuild the combat and exploration systems. </em></p>



<p>Granted, we wouldn't have expected anything different. This isn't a remaster, and the game would feel very old as a reimagining if those key systems were kept unchanged. Still, Kerslake also said that the brutal traps of the original Tomb Raider, such as the big, deadly rolling boulders, have been maintained.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Crystal Dynamics developers confirmed that the Lara Croft seen in Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis and in the upcoming Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the same character, just in different stages of her life and career. The former game revisits her origins, while Catalyst, which will indeed be set in India <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per earlier rumors</a>, will show Lara at her pinnacle.</p>



<p>In both games, Lara will be voiced by British actress Alix Wilton Regan, whose credits include Calista in The Last Story, Samantha Traynor in Mass Effect 3, the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Veilguard), Aya in Assassin's Creed Origins, Selemene on Dota: Dragon's Blood, Alt Cunnigham in Cyberpunk 2077, the Daedric Prince Ithelia in The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road, Lea in Lies of P: Overture, and the female player character in the upcoming Squadron 42.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Everstone Studio's online wuxia-themed action/adventure roleplaying game, Where Winds Meet, continues to attract more players to its finely crafted world. <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/2000213983790522645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the studio</a>, the game registered over 15 million players in its first month since launch. This milestone follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous one</a>, when the game had reached over 9 million players in just over two weeks. Granted, four days ago, Everstone Studio also launched Where Winds Meet on iOS and Android, which certainly helped a great deal with its absolutely massive addressable market.</p>



<p>Still, the game deserves much of the success it's enjoying. It's rare to find such a finely made free to play game, almost capable of rivaling premium titles in most regards, and even surpassing them in a few aspects. In Wccftech's 8.5/10 review, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em></p>



<p>Personally, I wish the MMO mode were not strangely devoid of NPCs, which makes it feel significantly less like a real open world compared to the solo mode. Still, it appears that most players are largely unaffected by this design choice.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Anyway, with such a strong fan base behind Where Winds Meet, Everstone is full steam ahead on delivering <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its original promise of a living, constantly evolving wuxia world</a>. This month alone, the players <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-december-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can expect new bosses, a new region, and new activities</a>. The developers have also teased the first expansion, The Imperial Palace, which is scheduled for release sometime next year.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Divinity at The Game Awards 2025</a>, a new game in the fantasy RPG franchise, Larian Studios has also released Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series S|X. The game was already available on the respective previous consoles (PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One) and could be played on the new ones through backward compatibility, but this is a native version and will therefore offer improved performance.</p>



<p>Existing users can follow Larian's guidelines to upgrade:</p>



<p><em>Depending on your platform, if you already have Divinity: Original Sin 2 installed, you'll receive a free update with the version applicable to your console. If you don't currently have it installed but would like to play again on a current-gen console, navigate to the Divinity: Original Sin 2 store page on either Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S, and you can download the upgrade for free. If you would like to upgrade your copy of Divinity: Original Sin 2 from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 or from PS4 to PS5 and are based in Japan, the upgrade will cost ¥100.</em></p>







<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition launched in 2018, a year after the base game, expanding the storyline and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-divinity-original-sin-2-refined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refining certain gameplay aspects</a>. The vanilla game was already amazing, though, having been widely acclaimed as one of the greatest cRPGs of all time by critics and fans. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On Wccftech</a>, it scored 9.6 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>It's hard to find a game with little to no flaws, but Larian Studios proved that, sometimes, it happens. With excellent story and characters, smart writing and masterfully crafted gameplay enhanced by the multiplayer modes, Divinity: Original Sin 2 truly deserves a place among the best cRPGs ever released.</em></p>



<p>Of course, it would later go on to be surpassed by Baldur's Gate 3. Still, if you haven't played it yet, it's a great way to get accustomed to the world of Rivellon in preparation for the freshly announced new entry. Larian assured that newcomers won't have problems if they choose to wait specifically for the upcoming game, but also said that those who played the previous installments will have knowledge of 'some continuity and characters'.</p>
