			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first PC Closed Beta Test</a> for the upcoming fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-dev-diary-provides-the-first-in-depth-look-at-its-features-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a>, we were able to send a few questions to Chrono Studio to learn a bit more about the game's features. You can read the entirety of the interview below. As a reminder, the CBT will take place later this month, and you can still sign up for it directly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873440/Chrono_Odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The game does not have a full release date yet, but we know it will be available on PC and consoles.</p>

<p><strong>As far as we can see, the game's main twist is the Chronotector. What can you tell us about its concept and usage in the game? Will it be available in PvP, too?</strong></p>
<p>The Chronotector allows players to manipulate time and space—slowing down enemies or reverting parts of the environment to a previous state. While its use is partially restricted in PvP to maintain fairness, it still plays a key role in strategic map control and as a tactical tool for escape or repositioning.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss character progression in Chrono Odyssey? Will there be skill trees, respeccing? What about multi-classing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we offer a detailed skill tree along with the ability to respec skills. While Chrono Odyssey does not feature a full multiclass system, players can freely switch between various weapon types, each supporting distinct playstyles. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and personalization in how players approach combat.</p>
<p><strong>How many weapons will be available in the beta? And what about the final game? Are there any class restrictions?</strong></p>
<p>In the beta, three classes will be available, and each class can wield three different weapon types. Weapons are designed to be freely chosen by the player, allowing for the development of hybrid playstyles that suit individual preferences and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell us about Chrono Odyssey's open world? Are there any dynamic events that will freshen up the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. The world of Setera features dynamic weather, time-based events, and region-specific bosses that appear depending on player activity and the in-game time cycle. Even when exploring the same area, players will encounter different experiences depending on the circumstances, ensuring that the world always feels alive and ever-changing.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share how group dungeons and PvE raids will work in the game? Are these staples of your PvE endgame plan?</strong></p>
<p>Dungeons and raids are core components of Chrono Odyssey’s PvE content. Designed as endgame challenges, they feature intense boss battles and offer some of the most rewarding progression-based loot. These encounters demand strategic cooperation, making them a central part of the game's long-term experience.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of PvP content can players expect to see in Chrono Odyssey?</strong></p>
<p>In this CBT, the available PvP content will be limited to 1v1 duels initiated by player choice and open-field PvP between characters who have enabled PvP mode. However, we are actively developing additional PvP-focused features, including open conflict zones and PvPvE battlefield content where players will compete over specific objectives while also contending with environmental threats. We look forward to introducing these features through our official channels in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to have several Closed Beta Tests before the full launch? If so, will there be a long wait between CBTs?</strong></p>
<p>We plan to conduct multiple closed beta tests, with each CBT followed by meaningful improvements and content updates. Our goal is to gather valuable feedback at every stage and steadily refine the game to deliver the best possible experience at launch.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
