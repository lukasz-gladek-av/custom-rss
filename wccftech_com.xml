			<p>Along with the unveiling of NVIDIA's GeForce <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-429-8-gb-379-20-percent-faster-4060-ti-2x-dlss-4/">RTX 5060Ti</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-8-gb-sweet-spot-gaming-299-over-100-fps-games-1080p/">RTX 5060</a>, we also got the announcement of the next four games that have added support for DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Offworld Industries' <a href="https://wccftech.com/squad-44-is-post-scriptums-new-name-update-adds-greek-faction-new-map-and-weapons/">SQUAD</a>, Misultin Studios and MicroProse Software's EXFIL and Torn Banner Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-update-in-2025-for-no-more-room-in-hell-2-released-adding-firefighter-zombies/">No More Room In Hell 2</a> join the ranks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-in-warhammer-40k-darktide-enlisted-and-karma-the-dark-world/">games</a> like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/">Control</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> in supporting DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-black-myth-wukong/">blog post</a> from NVIDIA, each game enjoys a performance boost, but the biggest headway seems to be made in Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>Players pushing 4K, with everything maxed out, while utilizing an RTX 50 series GPU "<em>can multiply performance up to 10X thanks to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution,</em>" NVIDIA claims.</p>
<p>"<em>At 4K, with full ray tracing enabled and every other setting maxed out, DLSS Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution multiply frame rates by an average of 10X. This massive performance boost enables GeForce RTX 5070 gamers to play at over 110 FPS, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti users to play at over 130 FPS, GeForce RTX 5080 owners to play at over 150 FPS, and GeForce RTX 5090 buyers to play at over 240 FPS, maxing out the capabilities of the latest 4K OLED G-SYNC compatible DisplayPort 2.1 displays.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, the performance boost you're able to see will always depend on the hardware you have in your system, but even considering that, it's still an impressive bump for what many players find challenging to run.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was one of the biggest titles in 2024, winning its fair share of awards, including the game of the year for both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-award-winners-2024-announced-black-myth-wukong-is-game-of-the-year/">Steam Awards</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/">Golden Joysticks</a>. It's also one of the sleekest-looking games in recent years if you've got the hardware for it. Now that it supports DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation, more players will be able to enjoy its wonderful visuals without losing frames as they would have before.</p>
