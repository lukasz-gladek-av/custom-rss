			<p>While Elder Scrolls fans can rest easy in the knowledge that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> is the next major new release from Bethesda to come, Fallout fans are left wondering when the studio will ever get to Fallout 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/">It might be greenlit</a>, but for now, the only new stories coming out of the Fallout universe <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/">are from the Amazon TV show</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/">Fallout 76</a>, and mods like Fallout: London. What we do have to look forward to in the short term, however, are the reported remasters on the way, one for Fallout 3, and, according to a new claim, one for Fallout New Vegas.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, following an interview Todd Howard did with GQ Magazine to discuss the latest re-release of Fallout 4, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, it was claimed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-fallout-3-remaster-hundreds-of-people-working-on/">Fallout 3 Remastered was in the works</a>, and would be a similar release to this year's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>



<p>Now, this time from Windows Central's Jez Corden, it's claimed that a Fallout New Vegas Remastered is also on its way. Replying to a post on X (formerly Twitter) where a user is commenting on the Fallout 3 Remastered rumors and the fact that it's not New Vegas, Corden replied with a simple "<em>Dw, nv is coming too</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is not the first time this year we've heard claims that a New Vegas Remaster is on the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiple-fallout-projects-in-the-works-including-one-everyone-wants/">as a rumor popped up this past July</a> claiming that multiple Fallout projects, including remasters of New Vegas and Fallout 3, were on their way. It's also worth remembering that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">saw more than 9 million players flock to the new version</a> of Bethesda's classic, and has remained one of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvmzub6k25">the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far</a>.</p>



<p>Bethesda knows <a href="https://wccftech.com/players-spent-more-on-remakes-than-remasters-in-last-two-years-ampere-analysis/">there's money to be made in those remaster/remake hills</a>, and considering the fact that the popular Amazon TV series adaptation is taking its characters to New Vegas in the upcoming season two, the timing is perfect for Bethesda to kick off a slew of Fallout remasters.</p>



<p>So while you should still approach claims around these coming remasters with caution, since, technically, it's possible these remasters don't make it out the door, if you're wanting to revisit Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas in a new, Oblivion Remastered-style light, you can take comfort in the fact that there are a lot of signs pointing to both remasters happening, and hopefully, very soon.</p>
