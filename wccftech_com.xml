			<p>It's been a while since Arkane has shelved the Dishonored IP. Granted, that part of the story was successfully concluded with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death of the Outsider</a> in 2017, but there are so many parts of that unique steampunk/dieselpunk world that would deserve to have their own games. Sure, it was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-and-dishonored-are-set-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Deathloop takes place in the same setting (albeit in the far future), but it's not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>A proper Dishonored 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> alongside other unannounced Bethesda games (The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3 remasters, a Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel) during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial in 2023, but none of those projects ever materialized, suggesting they were set aside after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax.</p>
<p>While the actual franchise may be lying dormant and there's no telling when it might return with Arkane Austin <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dead</a> and Arkane Lyon busy with Marvel's Blade, Arkane founder and series creator Raphaël Colantonio promised fans they will enjoy the next project in development at WolfEye Studios, which will marry the likes of Dishonored and Prey with an additional RPG layer. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-raphael-colantonios-next-game-is-and-isnt-like-dishonored" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>People who loved Dishonored and Prey are going to feel very at home. It's uncompromised… We are just going full on into that kind of game in the way we create worlds, the way we let choices to the player. And I think there are going to be even more choices this time because of the RPG layer. We'll have a lot of different ways to do things.</em></p>
<p>The game will be played in first-person like Dishonored. Colantonio also confirmed it will feature shooter-like gameplay.</p>
<p><em>There is something about real-time decision making, as opposed to everything being stats, that makes us feel more in the moment, more immersed. I'm surprised the intersection between RPG and first-person shooter has not been more of a thing.</em></p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, except that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/weird-west-developer-gets-investment-for-its-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more ambitious</a> than the studio's debut (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird West</a>) thanks to a generous investment received by WolfEye early on. We do know it is set in a steampunk world and a Limited Alpha will take place next year, with sign-ups open <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/my-first-gran-turismo-gt7-free-trial-is-out-tomorrow/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Polyphony Digital have revealed that My First Gran Turismo, the free trial for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Turismo 7</a>, will go live on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 tomorrow. Game creator and legendary designer Kazunori Yamauchi explained the purpose of My First Gran Turismo in a post <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p><em>My First Gran Turismo is a special free-to-play invitation to dive into the exhilarating world of motorsports. This experience holds a special place in my heart, as it pays tribute to the origins of the first Gran Turismo, where players of all generations discovered the joys of driving. Whether it’s introducing kids to the joy of racing for the first time or reigniting a forgotten passion for driving, My First Gran Turismo was designed to be both approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level.</em></p>
<p><em>This isn’t just about playing a game; it’s about embarking on a personal driving journey. We’ve made sure the experience is intuitive, allowing anyone to get behind the wheel and master the essentials, such as cornering, braking, and acceleration. By playing it, users will build confidence one lap at a time, tackling new challenges that’ll steadily refine their driving skills.</em></p>

<p>The My First Gran Turismo trial will feature three Race Events, three Time Trials, three Music Rally stages, a full suite of License Tests, eighteen unique cars, and these three tracks: Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit. Owners of PS VR2 can also look forward to checking out the trial in virtual reality mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's still no news about a PC version. Two years ago, Yamauchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a statement that ignited the hopes of PC gamers; however, he quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-7-pc-isnt-actually-in-development-confirms-yamauchi-series-has-sold-90-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recanted</a>, clarifying that while they were open to the possibility, nothing was being worked on at the time.</p>
<p>It's strange because Sony is slowly but surely porting all of its exclusives to PC. At this point, Gran Turismo 7 might be the biggest missing one, and it's all the weirder because adding such a big platform could definitely help fill out the online races.</p>
