			<p>If you're getting started with <a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-mmo-is-still-in-development-but-has-been-rebooted-says-riot/">League of Legends</a>, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the number of choices you have and how many champions there are to choose from, especially if you begin to consider the meta and off-meta builds, where some champions are played in a role that they were not originally designed for. If you're feeling a bit overwhelmed and aren't sure <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what champion</a> to pick if you want to play ADC (Attack Damage Carry), this guide will tell you some of the best ones to start with.</p>
<h2>Best Beginner-Friendly League of Legends ADCs</h2>
<p>There are a wide variety of ADCs available in League of Legends, with the roster continuously expanding. However, some of them are designated to be beginner-friendly and have significantly fewer mechanics to worry about compared to others. Here are some of the easiest ADCs you can start within League of Legends.</p>
<p><strong>Ashe&nbsp;</strong>is one of the easiest ADCs you can start within League of Legends. Compared to some of the others available, her abilities are relatively straightforward and don't require a tremendous amount of finesse. It's very easy to harass your opponent due to her range and frost capabilities, making it relatively easy to get the kill if you have a communicative support backing you up. When it gets to the late game, Ashe's Ult can be beneficial if you use it correctly, as it can fly the entire length of the map and freeze the person it hits. This can make for some very successful ganks and picks, especially if they are out of position and away from their teammates.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Tristana</strong> is a lot of fun and has some excellent mobility, which can keep her safe and get her out of sticky situations should you find yourself in them. Compared to other ADCs, her mobility is better than that of a fair amount of them, especially for those who are new to the game and don't want to try and figure out how to play characters like Akshan. Leveling up Tristana's explosives is vital, as it can help her get a kill from a distance if she manages to stack damage on the bomb. It's also great at chipping away at Turrets, and she can quickly clear the lane with her damage as her basic attacks damage nearby enemies when a minion is killed.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sivir</strong> is another ADC who is great at zipping down the lane, dealing a fair amount of damage, and chipping away at her opponent or the tower. Compared to other champions, Sivir has a great way of restoring lost mana, a resource that she relies on quite heavily to be able to use her other abilities. Using her Spell Shield, she has the capability to block the attack or crowd control from her opponent and gain mana back from using it successfully. It takes time to get to grips with her Spell Shield, especially if you're new to the game. Her ultimate is one of the most useful ults an ADC can have, as it speeds up both her and her allies and allows her to sprint down the lane to get into (or out of) the thick of it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Miss Fortune&nbsp;</strong>can be a real powerhouse once you get used to her abilities. It can be a little bit tricky getting used to her Double Tap ability, as you have to make sure you fire it on the right target to be able to get the crit on the other target. This can take some getting used to and doesn't always work out how you want it to. However, she has great wave clear pokes against her opponents and isn't too hungry compared to some other ADCs. Her ultimate can easily wipe out an entire team if you manage to aim it correctly, but this is another ability that may take a little bit of getting used to.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the most beginner-friendly ADCs in League of Legends that you can play right now and can often purchase using Blue Essence for a decent price. Good luck in the Summoner's Rift.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The third and final entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy will not shy away from the challenge of allowing players to fly freely around the map, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>Speaking during a panel today at G-Star 2024 going over the creation of the remake trilogy, the themes upon which each game was built, and more, as reported by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/638/G063881/20241115058/">4Gamer</a>, Director Naoki Hamaguchi provided a small update on the third yet-to-be-named entry in the series. As far as development is concerned, the plot for the game has been completed, the concept decided, and the team is already working on it. The concept, in particular, is extremely important to the game but could not be revealed at the time.</p>
<p>The one thing about the third entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake that Hamaguchi-san could talk about was the map. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> provided a big map to explore, but with the introduction of the Highwind airship, the development team needs to allow players to experience the world from a higher perspective. He also added that they will not take any shortcuts to achieve this and will take on the challenge of being able to fly freely around the map.</p>
<p>Considering the vast majority of the Final Fantasy VII world was recreated for Rebirth, it will be very interesting how the development team will overcome the challenge of recreating the entire world while allowing players to fly freely around it and make it interesting even when revisiting locations that were already explored in the second entry in the series. As the development team definitely exceeded expectations with Rebirth, in my opinion, there's little doubt they will be able to do so again with the third game that will conclude the story.</p>

			<p>In a special developer live stream today, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-still-in-pre-production-bioware-passes-star-wars-the-old-republic-new-dev/">Star Wars: The Old Republic team</a> announced the next major update that will be arriving to the MMORPG, with the update being titled Game Update 7.6 - Galactic Threads. This is set to be a relatively significant update, as a lot of new features and content will be added, as well as character art modernization. The update will begin to roll out in December to players across the globe, with the story missions arriving in Star Wars: The Old Republic in 2025.</p>
<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic was first released in 2011, and since then has evolved a fair amount, with there being plenty of content for Star Wars fans to get stuck into. One of the most important features being added in the Galactic Threads update is the modernization of the character and planet art. This is something that has been in the works for a while, but updating all of the models and planets is very time consuming. While the updates on modernizing the graphics are slow, players will be able to see texture changes to models such as the Human, Chiss, Cyborg, and Miralukan, bringing improved fidelity to the game. To showcase the changes that have been made, the SWTOR team has released a YouTube video that shows off the graphical updates they have been working on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet and Character Model Modernization coming to Game Update 7.6" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WN7JD4pTpks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, there is a ton more coming to the game aside from just this update. This includes new story missions that carry on straight from the Desperate Defiance storyline. Of course, these missions won't be rolled out until 2025, but players will at least be given time to get excited about them.</p>
<p>Additionally, the update will add a new boss fight called The Propagator Core XR-53, a new lair boss that will launch in Story and Veteran difficulties. Alongside this, there will be brand-new Dynamic Encounters, world content dedicated to immersing players in the exploration of the worlds they inhabit. The Dynamic Encounters will vary, depending on where you are and what you are doing. This could include having to take out Hidden Chain forces or herding together Banthas, who escaped. If you want to get stuck in, these encounters will first be arriving on Hoth and Tatooine, offering a bounty of rewards for players to earn.</p>
<p>If you want to know every last detail about what you can expect about the upcoming update to Star Wars: The Old Republic, <a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20241114-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website</a> has all of the info about what you can expect and some of the smaller features being added to the MMORPG.</p>
