			<p>During yesterday's PC Gaming Show 2025, Aspyr Media unveiled Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition, the definitive version of 2002's classic roleplaying game made by Obsidian Entertainment.</p>
<p>Aspyr Media promised smoother gameplay with refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI. Indeed, the game is coming to consoles for the first time (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch), although it's also available on PC (Steam and GOG), of course. Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition will debut on all these platforms on July 15 for $29.99, but a 10% discount is available until launch.</p>
<p>The game supports crossplay between all platforms when in co-op multiplayer mode (up to four players). Moreover, this version includes the base game and the three expansions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mask of the Betrayer:</strong> Cursed with an insatiable hunger only quelled by devouring spirits, the Shard-Bearer must travel to the Shadow Realm to unearth the cause of this dark affliction.</li>
<li><strong>Storm of Zehir:</strong> You and your crew are shipwrecked on the shores of a hostile jungle nation. Fighting your way back to civilization, you uncover a plot threatening to change Faerûn forever.</li>
<li><strong>Mysteries of Westgate:</strong> Beware the city of Westgate, where anything goes and everything has a price. Explore and expose the secrets hidden deep in the city’s underbelly before they consume you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition also fully supports Steam Workshop, providing access to a wealth of adventures and modules. Moreover, this version still allows the player to become a Dungeon Master and craft their own adventures to share with other players. The original game was renowned for its deep but complex modding tools.</p>
