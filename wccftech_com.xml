			<p>The new upscaling solution used by Guerrilla Games for Horizon Forbidden West and Zero Dawn Remastered on PlayStation 5 Pro delivers image quality that is essentially on par with NVIDIA DLSS on PC, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>In their review of the PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the two main entries in the series developed by Guerrilla Games, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> also compared the new upscaling solution used by both games with the other major upscalers available on PC, such as NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR 3. Using a similar 1440p base resolution to upscaled 4K resolution, Guerilla's upscaling solution handles a variety of visual elements much better than NVIDIA DLSS, such as reflections on water surfaces and even motion, while NVIDIA's upscaler handles particles better. Compared to AMD FSR 3, the upscaling solution used by Guerrilla Games in their titles on PlayStation 5 Pro does significantly better, as AMD's upscaler delivers blurry grass with a stationary camera and softer results in general.</p>

<p>Given the excellent results this upscaling solution delivers, it's not surprising that Guerrilla Games skipped using the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler, whose implementation has been lackluster, if not outright broken, in many of the games updated to take advantage of the new system's features. As this upscaling solution was developed for future titles and then backported to the Horizon games, it will be very interesting to see the image quality it will be able to deliver in the future and how it will compare to future versions of PSSR, which will reportedly be much better than the one seen in action so far.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro brings more to the table than just the AI-powered PSSR upscaler. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
