			<p>Obsidian announced that the cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a> will receive the fan-requested turn-based mode tomorrow. It will be a public beta going live on Steam and the Xbox PC app.</p>



<p>As you already know if you played the game, Pillars of Eternity is currently available only as a real-time with pause (RTwP) game, whereas its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadfire</a>, eventually introduced an optional turn-based mode. Fans had long requested this option in the first installment, and now Obsidian is delivering.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll have a number of settings to tweak in the new turn-based mode.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The announcement came directly from Josh Sawyer, the project director (also known for Fallout: New Vegas and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentiment</a>), who said:</p>



<p><em>There were a number of very reasonable criticisms of how the turn-based mode was implemented in Deadfire. Nick Carver and Jesse Bureno are trying to address those as well as they can. One of the major changes is that the action economy is a lot more accurate to the real time with pause game. It's not a 1:1 translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real time of pause mode. A lot of people commented that free actions felt abusable, which is true. That is now restricted and limited. That will feel like a significant change.</em></p>

<p>Another criticism levied against the turn-based mode in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire was that it simply felt too slow. A fix for that was increased lethality, which Deadfire got through a mod and the first installment is now receiving by default straight from Obsidian. Lastly, it will be possible to switch from combat to combat between real-time with pause and turn-based modes. Of course, being a beta, issues are expected. Obsidian encouraged players to check out the beta and deliver their feedback ahead of the final release of the mode.</p>



<p>Even though Pillars of Eternity is now a pretty old game (it was released ten years ago), the addition of the turn-based mode, now preferred by most users to RTwP, could be enough to make some people go back and check it out, especially after the positive launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a>, which is set in the same world.</p>



<p>A couple of years ago, Josh Sawyer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> he'd love to make Pillars of Eternity 3 with a Baldur's Gate 3-type budget. If that opportunity came along, he'd make it turn-based, so more experimentation feels like an interesting step toward that idea.</p>



<p>In other Obsidian news, the seemingly tireless studio has just released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another great RPG: The Outer Worlds 2</a>.</p>

			<p>Two NetEase-funded companies founded by MMO veterans, T-Minus Zero Entertainment and Fantastic Pixel Castle, shared the fate of losing NetEase's support, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just like many other studios</a>. Both have scrambled to find alternate publishers and ways to stay alive, and now, they have two announcements - one of hope and another of (almost) defeat.</p>



<p>T-Minus Zero <a href="https://www.t-minuszero-relaunch.com/tm0-news/t-minus-zero-relaunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in a press release</a> that a small group of veteran directors and founders has decided to acquire the studio name to carry the team's spirit forward, and they are relaunching as an independent production company. The studio now aims to create high-quality gaming experiences that bring people together with a close-knit team of veteran technical and creative leaders who work exceptionally well together. T-Minus Zero also claims to already possess a 'genre-forward concept' with substantial proof of interest and scalability across platforms.</p>



<p>Zachary Beaudoin, the new CEO, stated that the team is now seeking co-financing partners for T-Minus Zero's next round of development financing. Beaudoin previously worked at BioWare, Blizzard, and Crystal Dynamics.</p>



<p>As for Fantastic Pixel Castle, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmo-fantastic-pixel-castle-is-in-danger-netease-pulls-plug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we already knew the studio was in serious trouble</a>. Yesterday, founder Greg Street <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in a LinkedIn post that the studio now has a closure date: November 17. There is a chance the studio might still secure funding for its Ghost MMO after this date, but by then, the priority will be to help team members find employment.</p>



<p>I had interviewed both <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greg Street</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-qa-neteases-latest-aaa-team-plans-ambitious-things-never-before-seen-in-online-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rich Vogel</a> (the original founder of T-Minus Zero) back in 2023 when NetEase established the respective studios. Street was a key figure at Blizzard on World of Warcraft and later at Riot Games on League of Legends and the League of Legends MMO <a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-mmo-is-still-in-development-but-has-been-rebooted-says-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was eventually rebooted last year</a>. Rich Vogel, on the other hand, had worked on Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. It is currently unclear whether he'll stay after the studio's reboot.</p>
