			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Owlcat Games</strong> is a video game development studio that requires no introduction nowadays, as cRPGs are as popular as ever. Following the launch of the two entries in the <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/"><strong>Pathfinder</strong></a></em> series, which showed how the developer doesn't <strong>compromise in any way when adapting tabletop RPGs' rules in video game format</strong>, Owlcat launched <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</em></a></strong>, their first foray into the world created by Games Workshop. </p>



<p>Although the game was, by all accounts, <strong>a very solid game</strong>, some of the studio's now trademark clunkiness (and pretty much required pre-battle buffing) seeped into it, resulting in a game that was <strong>considerably less accessible</strong> than the title which contributed a lot to the current popularity of cRPGs: Larian's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</a></strong></p>



<p>Last year, Owlcat Games confirmed it was going back to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Imperium of Man</strong> with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em>, but with some twists. This time around, players would take the role of an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Inquisitor</strong>, one of the highest-ranking members of the Imperium's secret police and intelligence, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">whose authority is second only to the Emperor of Mankind himself</strong>. </p>



<p>Even those with little to no knowledge of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> world can easily understand what playing as one means: <strong>the freedom of taking on any challenge as they see fit</strong>, backed by what is recognized as one of the highest authorities in the universe.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251222113652_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy does an excellent job making the player feel they are always right, no matter their choices</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">During last year's Gamescom</strong>, I was able to check out a live demo of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em>, which made it abundantly clear how the entire experience is centered around one fundamental concept: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the player is always right</strong>. Inquisitors, after all, can do no wrong, so if the player so desired, they could have concluded the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">investigation</strong> featured in the demo by just <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">putting the blame for some killings on the first possible culprit</strong>, without having to worry about the consequences. This, coupled with some improvements to combat and user interface, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">definitely caught my attention</strong>.</p>



<p>With the release of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">alpha version</strong> last month, I was finally able to test for myself how far this concept could be pushed and whether there are indeed <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">no wrong choices</strong>. Turns out<span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">t</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">here aren't. In the same investigation set on Scintilla,</strong> which sees the Inquisitor look into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a series of mysterious disappearances</strong>, instead of <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">strictly adhering to the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Imperial Creed</strong> for the most part&nbsp;as I witnessed in the Gamescom demo, I took a more pragmatic approach,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not shying away from challenging the Creed when</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> it suited my purpose</strong>.</p>



<p>Appreciating even more the <strong>environmental storytelling and the beautiful world</strong> Owlcat Games is creating for <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> as well as the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/inquisitors-do-more-than-fight-warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-detective-system-showcased-in-new-screenshots/">investigation mechanics</a></strong> centered on adding and connecting the clues noted in the Investigation Journal in the game's Mind Map, I couldn't help but appreciate how <strong>the developer managed to create an incredible balance between truly giving player complete freedom without punishing them. </strong></p>



<p>While it's undeniable that <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> won't have the same type of <strong>world reactivity</strong> as <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, the <strong>differences between the Radical and Puritan "paths"</strong>, which replace the alignment system from Rogue Trader, will make sure <strong>role-playing will be an important part of the experience as much as combat is</strong>. Better yet, the game does an excellent job of <strong>making it clear</strong> in the writing that the <strong>Inquisitor is indeed always right</strong>, even if they go against the Imperial Creed.</p>



<p>Besides enjoying this sort of player freedom powering what could be the ultimate power fantasy in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40K</em> universe, short of playing as the Emperor, the <em>Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</em> alpha also made me <strong>appreciate the improvements to the turn-based tactical combat system introduced in Rogue Trader. </strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251222121752_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Combat in Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy has been significantly improved with new mechanics and quality-of-life features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The streamlining of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cover system</strong>, the ability to destroy any objects that can be used as cover, the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">aim specific body parts</strong> to disable enemies before defeating them, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Concentration mechanics</strong> which will allow players to prevent an enemy from using powerful attacks, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Morale system</strong> which can put the enemy in complete disarray and the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">end combat as soon as it is decided the enemy will have no chance of winning</strong> are all great improvements that are set to make battles better paced and more engaging than ever.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, but understandably given the early nature of this release, the Alpha hands out <strong>characters with pre-learned abilities</strong>. While this meant I couldn’t test the limits of the progression system,<strong> the synergy between classes and skills was already evident and satisfyingly easy to leverage.</strong></p>



<p>With the entire experience having been remade from scratch over Rogue Trader, I was really curious to see how Owlcat Games would address the <strong>sometimes excessive complexity</strong> of their cRPGs, and from the Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy Alpha, it really seems like the developer is <strong>managing to strike a happy medium between complexity and accessibility. </strong></p>



<p>With a story that will be<strong> smaller in scope</strong> than Rogue Trader but more varied, and with more meaningful combat encounters, I am really looking forward to seeing how <strong>my choices will shape the experience</strong> and whether the studio's complexity will indeed have been toned down for a more enjoyable experience. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to experience all this and finally <strong>wield the power to prove that, indeed, innocence proves nothing.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘By That Argument, We Should Never Have Made Mass Effect’ – BioWare Vet Defends Making Anthem]]></title>

			<p>Exactly a week ago, <strong>Electronic Arts</strong> took down the official servers of <strong>Anthem</strong>, <strong>BioWare</strong>'s failed live service game, as the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had announced back in July</a>.</p>



<p>A few days ago, YouTuber Destin Legarie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y65eoBVF0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted a 40-minute video interview with <strong>Mark Darrah</strong></a>, a BioWare veteran who worked on practically all of the studio's games since the first <strong>Baldur's Gate</strong> (1998) to <strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as a consultant</a>, after leaving the company), with the notable exception of the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series.</p>



<p>This includes Anthem, on which Darrah worked as an Executive Producer. The developer <strong>acknowledged a number of shortcomings</strong>, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game was originally inspired by <strong>Diablo</strong>, but Darrah says the team should have realized that, as a looter shooter, it should have really taken a lot more inspiration from <strong>Destiny</strong> instead. This is partly why the loot, endgame, and retention were all failures.</li>



<li>The flight mechanics were by far the most enjoyable for players, but they also <strong>caused several issues</strong>. For example, virtually every enemy unit had to have ranged attacks, since players could just fly away otherwise. Also, Darrah says that in co-op, three experienced players could drag a new player through the story at breakneck speed, disrupting the narrative flow.</li>



<li>BioWare even tested a version of Anthem <strong>without flight</strong> before E3 2017, though the goal was always to reintroduce it as they did in the final version.</li>



<li>In the interview, Darrah wonders if the developers <strong>should have proposed a 9-month public beta</strong>, keeping the entire team working on live iterations. This would have meant shipping the game, calling it "beta," and doing what happened in the first year, but before the official launch.</li>



<li>The industry veteran also believes <strong>BioWare Austin</strong>, which had much more experience with live-service games (it made <strong>Star Wars: The Old Republic</strong>), should have been handed the reins much earlier than they were. They were working on <strong>Anthem Next</strong>, which was supposed to introduce new ways to play beyond cataclysms and missions, new events, and other content. However, the team was understaffed, and Anthem Next <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-next-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was ultimately canceled in February 2021</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Toward the end of the video interview, Darrah adds that EA was <strong>partially but not entirely to blame</strong> and also addresses one of the common refrains you might have read on forums and social media: that BioWare should never have made Anthem in the first place. On that count, he doesn't really agree.</p>



<p><em>I think it's easy to blame EA, and certainly, they deserve a bunch of blame for Anthem, but it's not all their fault. But one thing that actually is worth mentioning, I think, is that there are some people that at the time loved coming out of the woodwork and saying 'see, I told you so', and it's like, 'BioWare should have never made Anthem because they are a single player RPG studio.' But <strong>my feeling is that BioWare has always been changing. By that argument, we should never have made Neverwinter Nights because we were a 2D RPG maker. We should never have made Mass Effect, because we were a tactical RPG maker, not an action RPG maker. So, I don't know that that argument holds a lot of weight for me</strong>. To me, it's like, yeah, your studios evolve, and they try new things. And was Anthem too big of a reach? Yeah, for sure. But could you tell at the time? I don't know. I don't know that you could.</em></p>



<p>Mark Darrah did provide a bit of hope for the future of BioWare, which is even more in jeopardy after Dragon Age: The Veilguard also largely <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-was-a-high-quality-game-that-failed-due-to-lack-of-shared-world-elements-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to meet the company's financial projections</a>. Everything hinges on the next Mass Effect game, but the developer said there's a silver lining: now <strong>BioWare is a single-project studio that is entirely focused on this title</strong>, instead of splitting itself across multiple projects, which happened with Anthem, <strong>Mass Effect: Andromeda</strong>, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard for parts of the respective development phases. Will that be enough to create a successful game? Only time will tell.</p>
