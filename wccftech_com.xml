			<p>fYesterday, Polish developer People Can Fly <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it is co-developing the upcoming prequel Gears of War: E-Day with The Coalition. People Can Fly has a long history with the franchise, having ported the first installment to PC and having led the development of Gears of War: Judgment, so it's a return home in a way for them.</p>
<p>PCF CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski stated:</p>
<p><em>Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.</em></p>
<p>Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF, said:</p>
<p><em>Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations. While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.</em></p>
<p>Mike Crump, Studio Head at The Coalition, added:</p>
<p><em>Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic. We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, Gears of War: E-Day will take fans back fourteen years before the events of the first entry, to Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde first emerged from the underground of the planet Sera to wreak havoc among humans. This will provide the chance to explore the beginning of the narrative as well as the birth of the close friendship between Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago.</p>
<p>No&nbsp;<span>official release window has been provided yet, although rumors&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">point</a> to a launch sometime this year—and a PlayStation 5 port <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may also be on the cards</a></span>.</p>

			<p>A new extremely handy Steam Deck mod is now available for download, allowing users to use AMD FSR 3 Frame Generations in games that support NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation for significantly improved performance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decky Framegen Plugin</a> is a Steam Deck plugin that replaces the NVIDIA DLSS DLL with the FSR 3.1 DLL, allowing users to use Frame Generation in Steam Deck in games that do not natively support AMD's tech, such as Black Myth Wukong, Final Fantasy XVI, Hogwarts Legacy and The Witcher 3, as showcased in a very informative video put together by Deck Wizard which also provides detailed installation instructions. While the end results aren't always perfect, as there are some visual issues such as ghosting in Final Fantasy XVI, for example, the mod definitely helps make more games playable with acceptable performance on Steam Deck, although games running below 30 FPS won't benefit too much from it due to the input lag caused by the low base framerate.</p>

<p>Since its release back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, the Steam Deck has become an incredibly popular gaming system, essentially bringing forth the age of handheld PCs that doesn't seem will end anytime soon. Following the launch of the original model, Valve released a slightly upgraded model featuring a gorgeous <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-679-usd-an-all-white-exterior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OLED screen</a> and a few other improvements, but the company doesn't seem interested in doing <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-wont-be-doing-yearly-steam-deck-releases/">yearly releases</a>, despite the demand. Earlier this month, it was rumored that a new version of the system powered by the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-amd-ryzen-2-not-works/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APU</a> was in the works, but Valve quickly squashed the rumors, so it will definitely be a while until we will be able to get a proper Steam Deck 2 in our hands.</p>
