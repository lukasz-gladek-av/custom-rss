			<p>Today, ArenaNet announced the release date for Repentance, the second free update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds</a>. The content patch is scheduled to go live on public servers on Tuesday, March 11th, introducing a host of new rewards and challenging activities for players of the MMORPG, as well as a new map, the Mistburned Barrens.</p>
<p>Deep within the ruins of Bava Nisos lies the Mists Gate, which brought the otherworldly titans to Tyria. Players will delve into the secrets of the mysterious Mursaat, long a source of legend dating back to the original Guild Wars, and confront their arcane experiments that have left their lands riven with spectral torment and bloodstone magic.</p>
<p>Repentance will feature a variety of new rewards, including a new weapon and armor set, six new relics to enhance character builds, an update to the Wizards Vault, new mini-pets, and new homestead recipes to be earned through in-game achievements. A new Mursaat Shadowcraft mastery track will help players explore the far reaches of Repentance.</p>

<p>In addition, the Titan Greer will be added to the Janthir Wilds Convergence gameplay mode, beginning an alternating boss rotation for players to test their mettle in the challenging 50-player activity. A more difficult challenge mode will be available in the Mount Balrior raid (first introduced in the November content update), with the most prestigious rewards available to players who complete it. Following the release of Repentance and the previous launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arenanet-to-release-godspawn-update-for-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-on-november-19-featuring-new-50-player-titan-battle-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godspawn update</a>, ArenaNet plans to release a third and final free content update for Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds before moving on to the next expansion.</p>
<p>As we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our exclusive late 2023 interview</a>, ArenaNet has switched to a yearly release plan for expansions. As such, fans can expect a new Guild Wars 2 expansion to land in the latter half of 2025.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is now available on PC, introducing plenty of new features that are sure to breathe new life into the latest main entry in the series.</p>
<p>The new version of the game includes, as announced a few days back, new features such as new ray tracing settings like ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion, that push the game's visuals beyond those offered in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 1 and 3 support, faster loading times with DirectStorage support and more. Now that the upgrade is out, we have also learned that all settings can go as high as Ultra and that the game features a Scene BVH Quality, thanks to a new screenshot provided by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/gabdeg.8633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gabdeg</a> on the ResetERA forums. Unfortunately, HDR support is nowhere to be found, which is a shame.</p>

<p>It's too early to say if the new ray tracing features included in the Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced PC release improve the game's visuals universally, but from the <a href="https://imgsli.com/MzU1MTE5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick comparison</a> put together by gabdeg, it's clear they do have a significant impact. Another <a href="https://imgsli.com/MzU1MTIx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparison</a> put together by another ResetERA forums member, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/vic20.61250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vic20</a>, highlights how much ray-traced global illumination makes a difference. Performance also seems to be solid, according to the first few reports, so it definitely looks like Rockstar Games has done a great job improving their highly successful game.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is now available for all PC users as a free upgrade, while the Legacy version will continue to be available to allow those with PC configurations that do not match those for the upgraded version of the game to continue playing normally. More information on the Enhanced release can be found <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">here.</a></p>
