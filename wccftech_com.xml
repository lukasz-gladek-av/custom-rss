			<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics took players back in time to an era of fighting games that plenty of fans longed to see come back. At least more than a million of them, as Capcom confirms that the arcade collection has officially surpassed one million copies sold, nearly a year to the day after its launch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's great to see a collection that does a great job of bringing these older fighting classics back into the spotlight hit this sales milestone, especially for everyone hoping that this will be the start of Capcom releasing a new entry into the series with a proper MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 4.</p>



<p>There's been no official word as to whether it'll happen, but more than a million copies is not something to scoff at, and while it's not a MARVEL vs. CAPCOM game, Capcom has surely been paying attention to the attention that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Arc System Works' Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> has been getting.</p>



<p>Hopefully, for the sake of MARVEL vs. CAPCOM fans, Capcom sees that there's room enough for both games.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">Wccftech reviewed the fighting collection last year</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote, "<em>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</em>"</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sony/">Sony</a> game development studios have already used its Enterprise LLM AI tool to develop some of its games, but the company is set to make these tools a support for creativity rather than a substitute.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf">2025 Corporate Report</a>, the Japanese company laid out its plans for AI usage in game development, confirming it has already been used in some capacity to support the development of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with the use of <em>"voice recognition software specialized for games to make simultaneous subtitling<br>automatic in some languages"</em>, and to test some models using Horizon series protagonist Aloy. Since 2023, over 50,000 people in 210 different teams within the company have started using the Enterprise LLM tool, which helps them use AI safely for chat or writing help and connect it with daily work tools. With a focus on potential legal, privacy, and ethics issues, Sony aims to make AI a safe support for creativity, and not a substitute for developers, to accelerate and streamline the development process, such as improving image quality with upscaling tech, which the company is already doing with the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler.</p>



<p>The use of AI in video game development has been a hot topic of discussion for quite some time, and some developers have highlighted in the past few months how it can help a large-scale development process that is progressively becoming less and less sustainable for various reasons. Back in June, Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai highlighted how game development has to change to remain sustainable and how <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">AI can be used to improve efficiency</a>, which mirrors Sonyâ€™s vision of using AI to streamline the development process, as outlined in the 2025 Corporate Report</p>
