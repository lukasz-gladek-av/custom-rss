			<p>The burden of the US tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump is taking a heavy toll on the shares of Japanese gaming companies today. Sony was hit the hardest, losing just over 10% of its market value in a single session. Nintendo isn't far off, losing 7.85% today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Big N is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a>. Pre-orders were supposed to go live on Wednesday, April 9; however, they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> in the United States precisely because of the aforementioned tariffs, and now users fear the console and its accessories might get even pricier. Needless to say, investors aren't keen on the impact this might have on the console's success, either.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo, known for Dynasty Warriors, Ninja Gaiden, and Atelier among others, is losing 7.63%. Bandai Namco, publisher of franchises like Ace Combat, Dark Souls, Dragon Ball, and Tekken just to name a few, is losing 7.37%. SEGA Sammy, the legendary publisher of franchises like Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, Like a Dragon, Sonic, and Total War, is close by with -7.29%. CAPCOM, another revered Japanese gaming company (Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, etc.), loses 6.61%. Square Enix (Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Star Ocean) loses 5.62%. Lastly, KONAMI is currently down 'only' 5.19%. The latter company has relied less on videogaming for some time, although that is changing rapidly with the revival of beloved franchises such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the tariffs will probably hit Western game companies just as hard as they are doing with Japanese ones. However, due to the timezone, this is the first glimpse we have at how the industry (which is already ailing due to increased budgets and stifled growth) is reacting to the application of the US tariffs. It's not looking good, that's for sure.</p>

			<p>With a brief teaser trailer, Bungie has <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1909021981275533601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the Marathon gameplay reveal showcase will take place on Saturday, April 12, at 10 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game revives the developer's sci-fi franchise, which was originally created in the 1990s. However, this time around, the genre is the trending extraction shooter. The development had a bit of a bumpy road, between the studio's layoffs and the scandal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved the former Marathon game director</a>.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, though the developers did share a few details. The new director recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that users will be provided with many different tools to find in the game, such as weapons and equipment that changes their character's stats or modify some of their capabilities, such as healing consumables.</p>
<p>Players will pick a Runner character before entering the game. Each Runner has a few abilities that the player can further customize. While within the game, users will be assigned several objectives, each coming with its own risks and rewards. Furthermore, if the player cannot extract successfully, they'll lose all the loot they had gathered during the session.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Earlier, the former Game Director had <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that player actions would influence the persistent world in Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond just the “story of your last run”, however, we want to give players the chance to affect these persistent zones and the larger world as a result. For example, imagine a crew discovering a previously undiscovered artifact that, when activated, opens a new area of the map for all players to explore. In essence, at Bungie, we’re creating a game where the actions of players can have ramifications for the world and players with each unfolding season.</em></p>
<p>Marathon will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with cross-play enabled between all platforms to unify the community.</p>
