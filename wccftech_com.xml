			<p>The first Batman: Arkham Knight HD texture pack is now available for download, ten years after the game's debut on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>The new texture pack, which has been created by GPUnity in collaboration with other developers such as Neato, Mr. Binks, and Ranger, enhances multiple low-resolution textures with a mix of upscaling and manual work, and the end results go a long way in improving the game's visuals at high resolutions. You can download the texture pack from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/batmanarkhamknight/mods/2671">Nexus Mods</a>, and check out how the new textures improve the game's visuals in the video below.</p>

<p>Batman: Arkham Knight is the last entry in the series developed by Rocksteady. Released back in 2015 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, the game is remembered for having been released in a terrible state on PC, requiring <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-gets-new-pc-patch-to-improve-vram-management-november-dlc/">multiple patches</a> to fix. The third and final main entry in the series was ported to Nintendo Switch in late 2023, becoming likewise infamous for being one of the worst third-party ports released on the system, running at a whopping<a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/"> 0 FPS</a> in some scenarios. The Nintendo Switch 2 excellent backward compatibility feature, however, allows the game to take advantage of the system's specs to <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-fixed-nintendo-switch-2/">brute force better performance.</a></p>



<p>After releasing Batman: Arkham Knight, Rocksteady released Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, a live service game that not only failed to deliver an engaging experience but also looked <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-dated-batman-arkham/">considerably worse</a> than the third entry in the studio's iconic series. You can learn more about the failed live service game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Publisher Kalypso Media announced Disciples: Domination, a new installment in the dark fantasy turn based strategy RPG franchise. This is the direct sequel to 2021's Disciples: Liberation (currently 65% off on Steam), though the developer has changed. Whereas Liberation was made by Canadian developer Frima Studio, Domination is being developed by French developer Artefacts Studio.</p>



<p>The narrative of Disciples: Domination begins fifteen years after the ending of Liberation, when Avyanna freed Nevendaar from the gods' tyrannical grip. Players will step on Queen Avyannaâ€™s throne and attempt to hold together a crumbling kingdom.</p>



<p>The fire of doubt burns within the Queen, sparked by the weight of the Yllian throne and stoked by dreams of becoming the monsters she once defied and destroyed. Paralyzed by fear and haunted by her own power, her rule begins to crumble, with allies disappearing and abandoning her just as an unknown force spreads strife and madness throughout her realm.</p>



<p>Players' choices will shape the future, whether for salvation or ruin. As they chase the truths behind the ceaseless conflicts, dark magic, and conspiracies infecting the empire, they must also face betrayal, strife, and shadowy schemes. </p>



<p>Over the course of Disciples: Domination, they'll get to choose their companions. They can be consulted for guidance on the many choices that will shape the faction's reputation and impact how others react to Avyanna's rule. In combat, players will lead their army in tactical, grid-based battles with faster pacing, dynamic events, and richer interaction. New skills, faction abilities, and unit synergies deepen the strategic options available, along with the unique system of strengths and weaknesses.</p>
