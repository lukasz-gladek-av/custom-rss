			<p>The 2K launcher is no more. Many PC gamers will undoubtedly be overjoyed about the prospect of launching their favorite 2K games without having to go through that launcher, especially since it was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-midnight-suns-pc-performance-can-reportedly-be-boosted-by-turning-off-2k-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsible</a> for performance drops in some cases.</p>
<p>However, there are some steps to take to remove the 2K launcher from the various supported games. Thankfully, they were outlined in a helpful article on the <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JBCNYWH2Q8X3MAWETFS82N9A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated 2K support page</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Removing the Launcher</strong></em><br>
<em>The first thing is to try closing and reopening Steam - that means completely closing and not just using the X to minimize the platform. Rebooting your PC is a good way to be sure it happened. For Epic, just make sure you've downloaded the most recent update for the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Click Play and Go!</strong></em><br>
<em>Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will now all launch directly into the game as soon as you click Play.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition</strong></em><br>
<em>The Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Steam and the Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Epic will each have slightly different paths to getting into the games. Please see <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/34847163808403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> for more information.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Civilization VI</strong></em><br>
<em>Civilization VI on Steam had the 2K launcher removed earlier this year, so no additional steps are needed. </em><em>In the case of Civilization VI for Epic, it now directly opens into the game when launched from Epic. The version opened by default is the DirectX 11 version. If you would like to play the DX12 version, please see <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/32212020230163" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> for instructions on how to open that version at launch instead.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Civilization V</strong></em><br>
<em>Civilization V now uses the Steam Launch options to open the game. The order is the same as was present in the previous 2K launcher, so the default (top) option is “Play Sid Meier’s Civilization V (DirectX 9)”, followed by “Play Sid Meier’s Civilization V (DirectX 10/11)”, and “Play Sid Meier’s Civilization V (Touch)”. As with all Steam games that have launch options, the desktop shortcut will always open the default option, in this case, the DirectX 9 version. For more details, <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/34890889538707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read this</a>.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>XCOM 2</strong></em><br>
<em>XCOM 2 for Steam is a special case, as the 2K launcher included Mod support functionality. You </em><em>can read more about this <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/34883894563347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Of note, these changes will let you enable mods on the Steam Deck! XCOM 2 on Epic will now open the Original XCOM 2 Mod Launcher, detailed in the linked article above.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>XCOM: Chimera Squad</strong></em><br>
<em>XCOM: Chimera Squad also has the Mod launcher as optional, with a secondary option available to directly launch the game. Mods are also available on Steam Deck for Chimera Squad as well, but please see our <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/articles/34884258027411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated article</a> for some important information.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-utterly-destroys-performance-rtx-4080/</link>

			<p>The Portal 2 RTX Remix path tracing mod looks <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">incredible</a>, but its improvements come at a very high cost, as path tracing in the game is so demanding that it utterly destroys performance at 4K resolution on an RTX 4080 GPU.</p>
<p>A new comparison put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> does a great job highlighting how demanding path tracing can be. At native 4K resolution, the framerate drops from around 200 and 300+ FPS to the low 20s and 30s range, depending on the scenario, on an RTX 4080 GPU, which should be more than capable of delivering higher framerates even with path tracing. For playable framerates, Portal 2 RTX Remix essentially requires NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation to push past the 60 FPS range at 1440p and 1080p resolutions in some scenarios.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal 2 Path Tracing with RTX Remix On vs Off - Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3BcYtKmmlE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you want to try out the Portal 2 RTX Remix mod yourself, you can download it by going <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx">here</a>. The mod was never intended to support the game, and the game effects are rendered using shaders, so you should expect to experience some other issues besides the low performance.</p>
<p>Portal 2 is the second entry in the series created by Valve, introducing a variety of improvements over its predecessor, including a separate two-player cooperative campaign. More information on the game can be found on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/">Steam Store page.</a></p>

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">Red Dead Redemption</a> mods released online in the past few days offer various visual improvements, new gameplay features, and better historical accuracy for guns.</p>
<p>The first one of these mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upscaled Everything mod</a>, which doesn't yet upscale every texture in the game as the name would suggest but brings significant improvements to a variety of objects, such as wanted posters, blood splats, bullet holes, the moon, and John Marston himself. The mod creator also confirmed that every other texture yet to be upscaled eventually will, but it will require some time.</p>

<p>The second of these new Red Dead Redemption mods is one that gun buffs and those looking to make the game a more historically accurate experience should consider. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/461?tab=description">The Guns of the Old West Historical Overhaul mod</a> renames in-game weapons to reflect their real-life counterparts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/06-1.webp"></a></figure>

<p>The third and final new Red Dead Redemption is the only one that introduces a new gameplay feature - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/451?tab=description">a first-person view mode</a> for increased immersion. As the game was never intended to be played in first person, there are some clipping issues, such as when riding a horse, but outside these issues, the game should be fully playable with a modded camera view. The modder also recommends using the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ClipTweaks - FPS-DOF-FOV mod</a> for a higher field of view if needed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/07-1.webp"></a></figure>

<p>Red Dead Redemption is finally available on PC, 14 years after its original release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is also available on PlayStation consoles and Nintendo Switch and is fully playable on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S via backward compatibility.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Looks Better on PlayStation 5 Pro in Performance Mode as of Patch 1.06 Due to PSSR Issues in Quality Mode]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-playstation-5-pro-looks-better-performance-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-looks-better-on-playstation-5-pro-in-performance-mode-as-of-patch-1-06-due-to-pssr-issues-in-quality-mode.1046325/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-playstation-5-pro-looks-better-performance-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill 2 continues to be not where it should be on a system like the PlayStation 5 Pro, and the improvements introduced in the latest patch released last week are not enough to significantly improve the game on the mid-generation console.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at how the game's aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-patch-1-06-playstation-5-pro/">1.06 patch</a> improves the game on PlayStation 5 Pro over the previous update, which introduced PSSR support that led to more issues than benefits in terms of visual quality. For the new patch, in Performance Mode, developer Bloober Team actually went back to TSR for Performance Mode, and the benefits are evident, as global illumination and reflections are more stable and less noisy, and there's no more massive disocclusion when moving the camera as in the previous version of the game. However, in general, image quality is not so different from the base model, and the slightly better performance may be due to the different cost of TSR over PSSR and not due to any actual improvement.</p>
<p>One thing that is very surprising in the latest version of Silent Hill 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro is that the game looks better in Performance Mode than in Quality Mode, as the latter still uses PSSR, which isn't a very good fit at the time for the types of visuals the game pushes. Performance is a little more stable than on the base model, but in terms of image quality, it still leaves a lot to be desired, requiring more work to actually get to the point where it should be on a system like the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 PS5 Pro Patched: Are The Image Quality Problems Fixed? It's Complicated..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giugvMWCclY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Technical issues aside, Silent Hill 2 is a more than worthy game to get not only for fans of the series but for any survival horror fan, as Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking what is widely considered one of the best entries in the Konami series. You can learn more about the game in Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review.</a></p>
