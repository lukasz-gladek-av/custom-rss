			<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet developer Racoon Logic Studios has just released a new update and a new demo for its sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">2020's Journey to the Savage Planet</a>. The demo is only available on PC, but the update is on all platforms, adding a new photo mode, new habitat customization features, and on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, a new Performance graphics mode that gets the framerate up to 60 FPS.</p>



<p>The news also came with a new trailer, showcasing the features of its fairly extensive photo mode, which lets you make several edits and changes, even add in some of the creatures you'll study and capture over the course of the game's campaign.</p>

<p>Regarding the demo, it'll showcase Revenge of the Savage Planet in two parts. The first, which is available now, is just the first hour of the game, giving you a chance to get acquainted with the game's setting and tone in those opening moments.</p>



<p>The second, which will be made available at a later date, is a custom abilities mode, which will let you experience how the game feels when your character is upgraded and kitted out with more gear and tools. It'll also be playable in co-op, which can be a key element to having as much fun as possible in Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>



<p>For the new habitat features, 40 new objects have been added to the game for players to customize their homes with.</p>

<p>"<em>We know that money is tight. We feel you. So if you’re not 100% certain you’ll enjoy our game, here’s a free demo</em>," said Racoon Logic Studios creative director, Alex Hutchinson, in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>Try it. We think you’ll like it. We worked on it for 4 years and now it’s the price of two expensive coffees. You’ll play the tutorial and then maybe fool around with a bunch of late game abilities. Give it a shot. Please?</em>"</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the first game, and have yet to check out Revenge of the Savage Planet, it's worth giving the demo a chance. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">I reviewed it for Wccftech earlier this year, I wrote</a>, "<em>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further.</em>"</p>
