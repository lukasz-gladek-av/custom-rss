			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">Lost Skies</a>, the upcoming survival adventure co-op game that involves flying from one airborne island to the next, has a date set for its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> early access release: April 18, 2025. The news came from developer Bossa Games with a release date trailer showing off more gameplay and beauty shots for the game.</p>

<p>A playable build of Lost Skies was available during February's Steam Next Fest, and according to a press release from Bossa Games, it was one of the more popular titles during the festival. An uplifting note for the studio, to be sure, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-scales-back-team-focusing-on-lost-skies-development/">Bossa Games announced layoffs</a> at the top of the year.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear how many developers were laid off at the time, just that there were 40 team members left at Bossa Games to get Lost Skies across the finish line. It'll be interesting to see how the game's launch goes. Early access games are expected to not be perfect at launch, but it definitely couldn't have been easier to prepare Lost Skies for April 18th with fewer people working on the game.</p>
<p>At the time, Bossa Games co-chief executive officer Henrique Olifiers said that the layoff was so the team could focus on "<em>the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future.</em>" A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">gameplay trailer</a> had been showcased for Lost Skies only two weeks ahead of the layoff announcement.</p>
<p>That said, its popularity during Next Fest adds to the proof that Lost Skies is striking a chord with players. For Bossa Games' sake, hopefully, the early access launch will continue the momentum the Next Fest demo kicked up. The team aims to launch version 1.0 before the end of the year, though of course, this will depend on player feedback.</p>
