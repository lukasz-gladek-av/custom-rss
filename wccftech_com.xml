			<p>The <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/343?utm_source=MergeMail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=mergemail-campaign-439411">latest patch</a> for <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-controversial-267-pve-mode-will-at-least-be-given-for-free-to-edge-of-darkness-owners/">Escape From Tarkov</a> adds plenty of fixes and improvements based directly on feedback from players, addressing several highly requested quality of life features, fixes for enemy AI in both PvE and PvP, and audio.</p>
<p>Developer Battlestate Games says that the "<em>audio engine systems and its individual subsystems have been significantly expanded to provide a more immersive Escape from Tarkov experience.</em>"</p>
<p>Battlestate Games warns that while the patch "<em>has gone through several stages of testing,</em>" it still isn't the final version, so players could still experience "<em>unexpected audio behavior in various situations</em>."</p>
<p>The studio is releasing this patch as another stage in its testing for these fixes, adding that "<em>this stage is necessary to collect feedback and do more tests on a diverse variety of players' hardware and software. We are already preparing a set of fixes for the upcoming updates and your feedback and detailed issue reports will help us in refining and stabilizing the system for all players</em>."</p>
<p>Here's the full list of fixes coming for audio, AI, and the quality of life improvements for Escape from Tarkov from the latest patch notes:</p>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Readjusted the sound subsystem that checks for obstructions between the listener and the source:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved the sound processing between the listener and the source when the source was behind obstacles: uneven terrain, rocks, vehicles, crates, and other environmental elements;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues where various sounds were processed and muffled incorrectly;</em><br>
<em>Improved the sound penetration processing inside and outside interiors with walls of different thickness</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the sound penetration processing between floors of buildings and on stairways;</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the occlusion of interactive windows and doors;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Reduced the loudness of bushes in first and third person;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the cause of the missing announcer warnings upon using the interactive buttons in The Lab;</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the sound occlusion on various locations to enhance the detail.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved the interaction of bots with doors;</em></li>
<li><em>PMC bots will now try to avoid areas where the location Bosses initially spawn and are less likely to engage in combat with them;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues where bots could walk down stairs or other uneven surfaces faster than usual;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the causes for bots appearing in the air or in the ground;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the specific situations in which bots would tilt their weapons upwards for no reason;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the issues in which Boss guards and PMC bots were friendly to each other;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues in which The Goons would appear on multiple locations at the same time in PvE.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality of Life</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Added an item search window with the ability to find items in stash by category or by name;</em></li>
<li><em>Eyewear and masks with the flash protection stat now reduce the glare effects from light sources. Items with this stat have also been rebalanced;</em></li>
<li><em>Added the display of in-game raid time when pressing the [O] key by default;</em></li>
<li><em>Added the ability to automatically convert currency if not having enough when purchasing an item;</em></li>
<li><em>Added the highlighting of attachments that are available for purchase from traders on the weapon build screen;</em></li>
<li><em>Added the ability to pin the tasks at the top of the list on the task tab;</em></li>

<li><em>Improved the usability of specific optical and thermal sights;</em></li>
<li><em>Added nape protection for Redut series body armor (Redut-M, Redut-T5). The cost of these armors has been adjusted;</em></li>

<li><em>Rebalanced the operation of the RShG-2 rocket launcher.</em></li>
</ul>

			<p>Xbox has confirmed through <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1937133550869876827">a post on X</a> that it will be attending Gamescom 2025, which likely means another showcase from the company sometime between August 20 and 24.<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1937136830014754891"> Bethesda</a> and the <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24215994">World of Warcraft team at Blizzard</a> will also be attending the event.</p>
<p>We've had a Gamescom showcase from Xbox each year since 2021, with last year's attendance including <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-3-days-of-livestreams-for-gamescom-2024/">multiple livestreams for Xbox games</a>. While we don't yet know what we'll see at this year's show, there are a few games we should look forward to seeing.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> event the company hosted, we now have a clearer idea of what's due out in the fall from Microsoft, meaning there's a good chance we'll learn more about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, which is currently set to release sometime before the end of the year. It could also be where we get the official announcement of the recently leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-leaked-ahead-of-announcement/">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</a> VR headset, and potentially some VR ports of Xbox games.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> could very likely get one more big marketing push before its October 29, 2025, release date. The same is likely for the recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle DLC</a> that's due out on September 4, 2025.</p>
<p>There's also a strong chance we'll see more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Black Ops 7</a>, after Xbox capped off its Summer Game Fest showcase with this year's entry in the Call of Duty franchise. Each game in the series is usually out sometime between October and November, so it's likely we'll get a release date reveal during whatever showcase Xbox hosts.</p>
<p>There's also a chance we see a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, which was also featured during the SGF event that Xbox hosted. We got a release window with its SGF trailer, so it's possible we'll get a proper release date with a new trailer for Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>And now that we have a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, it wouldn't be a surprise if Team Ninja and Platinum Games have a new gameplay trailer set for Gamescom 2025, and potentially a show-floor gameplay demo for those in attendance.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that even if Xbox doesn't host a livestream event, however unlikely that may seem, its attendance at Gamescom 2025 does make it likely that anything we've seen from the company that we know is coming this fall will likely be available to demo ahead of that fall release date.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll find out more official information soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Seoul-based game development studio Shift Up has finally released Stellar Blade for PC earlier this month. The game, originally codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-eve-looks-stunning-in-first-playstation-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project EVE</a>, was actually supposed to launch on PC right away alongside PlayStation 4 and even Xbox One.</p>
<p>However, when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-new-name-project-eve-visually-stunning-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resurfaced</a> in September 2022's State of Play stream as Stellar Blade, it did so as a PlayStation 5 exclusive with Sony Interactive Entertainment set to publish. Back then, the developers still hoped for a 2023 launch, but the launch had to be delayed until April 2024, when it became <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> for the PS5.&nbsp;<span>Shift Up&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a PC port and a sequel only a month later</span>, although this version of the action game took over a year to be released.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, quality is all that matters, especially given the current state of the games industry. Therefore, I'm happy to say that Stellar Blade on PC is a very solid port on all accounts. It doesn't even seem like Shift Up got any help from Sony's dedicated PC porting team, Nixxes Software, which makes the port's quality all the more impressive.</p>
<p>First things first. This PC version includes most of the technical bells and whistles we expect from a 2025 triple-A launch, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full support for Ultra-wide and Super Ultra-wide display (21:9 and 32:9), cutscenes included</li>
<li>Support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution (with the latest transformer model), AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, NVIDIA DLAA and FSR Native AA</li>
<li>Support for the DualSense controller's haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and controller speaker features</li>
<li>Support for High Dynamic Range displays</li>
<li>Six predefined frame rate limiter options (30 FPS, 45 FPS, 60 FPS, 120 FPS, 144 FPS, 240 FPS, and of course, unlimited frame rate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a few things are missing, like Intel XeSS, a 165 FPS frame rate limiter option, better HDR calibration options (they're the same for SDR: brightness, contrast, and UI brightness), and possibly a field of view slider, although the latter isn't really standard for third-person games.</p>
<p>Overall, though, there's more than enough here to be satisfied, especially since the game itself runs very smoothly. Powered by the Unreal Engine 4, Stellar Blade can run <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-gets-added-to-marvels-spider-man-2-mecha-break-rematch-and-dragonkin-the-banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at an average of 540 frames per second</a> on a GeForce RTX 5090 with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade PC 4K Gameplay Max Settings, NVIDIA DLAA" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3gCmP8DXyI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this case, however, there's little reason to use Performance Mode when the frame rate is already so high. In our testing, we used NVIDIA DLAA while also maxing all the graphics settings and still registered a maximum frame rate of 423 FPS, an average frame rate of 377 FPS, and a minimum frame rate of 313 FPS, in a custom benchmark run of the Wasteland level seen in the video above.</p>
<p>Being an Unreal Engine 4, Stellar Blade on PC is not entirely devoid of the all-too-familiar stuttering we've unfortunately come to expect from the technology. When analyzing the data captured with FrameView, nearly 12% is labeled as stuttering. On the other hand, the rest of the gameplay is buttery smooth, delivering a great action experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Stellar-Blade-PC-Benchmark-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Sure, the game isn't the most visually demanding in 2025. It doesn't have path tracing, or even just ray tracing, or UE5's Lumen global illumination. Even so, the art style goes a long way toward delivering an aesthetically appealing experience.</p>
<p>The upside of launching one year later is that the game has been improved through several updates. Furthermore, there are two expansion packs (one themed around NieR: Automata and another around Shift Up's first big hit, the gacha Goddess of Victory: Nikke) that can be purchased separately or as part of the Complete Edition.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm having a lot of fun playing Stellar Blade. While it is a fairly straightforward experience could certainly have used more complexity (and more narrative, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> recently by Shift Up's CEO), it understands the core of what's entertaining about an action videogame, and that's why it has reached so many players.</p>
