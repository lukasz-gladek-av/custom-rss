			<p>Rematch has surpassed 5 million unique players across all platforms, developer Sloclap announced. It's a strong milestone for the game, just one month after launch, even with it missing key features like crossplay support, which it will continue to miss for another 6-9 weeks, according to Sloclap.</p>



<p>Sloclap announced the milestone with a <a href="https://x.com/sloclap/status/1947325700681159130">post on its official account on X</a>, where it thanked players for the support and reiterated its commitment to "<em>make Rematch better</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Like any live game, that process is going to take time, but it's perhaps taking longer than players would have expected, with crossplay support being the hot-button topic, due in part to how Sloclap handled the lack of crossplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">Hours before it was set to launch</a>, Sloclap let players know that Rematch would be launching without crossplay. Sloclap had tried to prepare it for launch but decided far too late to let players know that it wasn't going to happen. Later, Sloclap apologized for the error, as Rematch also launched with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">bevy of bugs and matchmaking issues</a> that it was focused on fixing, but made sure to emphasize that crossplay functionality was at the top of its priority list.</p>



<p>In the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534356176690741599?l=english">latest developer update</a>, Sloclap went over a number of features it is working on based on player feedback, while also apologizing for the problems some players continue to face, even as the game is in a much better state than it was a month ago.</p>



<p>In the short-term future, Rematch is getting a patch sometime this week that will enable players to remap controls while playing with a controller, add colorblindness options as an accessibility update, and fix a number of bugs. There's also netcode fixes to come, though there's no exact timeline as to when all these updates will arrive. Best to keep an eye on the game's social accounts if you want to know exactly when everything goes live.</p>



<p>New ranked queues, improvements to keyboard and mouse controls, the ability to report toxic players, regional server fixes, and overall upgrades to matchmaking and its ranking system are also all under review from Sloclap as it continues to work on Rematch. It doesn't seem like there's a specific timeline for any of this, but some of the issues players are reporting, such as complaints about the structure of the current ranking system, take time and experimentation to be fixed, and even then, it still won't please everyone.</p>



<p>Needless to say, while it's great for Sloclap that Rematch has had such a strong launch month, with more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-suprasses-1-million-units-sold-and-3-million-unique-players/">1 million copies sold</a> and now more than 5 million players having checked out the game with more than 60 million hours played across the globe, that will all be for nothing if it can't stay on top of its issues. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">I reviewed Rematch for Wccftech</a>, it was clear to me that the gameplay was very tight and highly polished, something that didn't really come as a huge surprise from the team that made such a solid melee fighter in Sifu. But its technical issues and structural issues beyond what happens on the pitch are what bring it down. I've still been playing a game of Rematch every day or so, but it would be nice to have a gameplay session where I don't lose a game because my tackle didn't register and the opposing team was able to score. Or one where we didn't have to scramble to protect our net because suddenly the keeper couldn't pick up the ball.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll start to see these fixes come in soon, and for the sake of the player base and matchmaking, crossplay will arrive closer to that six-week mark than nine weeks. </p>

			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza has been a stellar return for Nintendo's beloved ape, with the critical consensus from players and critics making it one of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">2025's best games so far</a>, and as for its commercial success, it was reportedly at the top of the sales charts for physical games in the UK. That said, it didn't come close to hitting the heights of Super Mario Odyssey's launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a> founder and editor-in-chief, Christopher Dring, <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167">posted on X</a> that Donkey Kong Bananza was at the top of the UK's physical sales charts, and that its launch was "<em>3x bigger than the launch of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze."</em> However, Dring reports that it was "<em>less than half of Super Mario Odyssey's</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bonanza launches at No.1 in the UK chart (physical sales) . Its launch is 3x bigger than the launch of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze on Switch. But it is less than half of Super Mario Odyssey’s</p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza was only released days ago at the time of this writing, so Dring is only reporting on the launch week sales. It's also worth noting that it's only physical sales for one region. Physical sales are still an important moniker for Nintendo games, since the only people still buying games physically seem to be Nintendo fans, but they're not yet the whole picture of Bananza's success.</p>



<p>As we get more information about Bananza's sales in the coming weeks and months, it'll be interesting to see how the game continues to take off. The comparisons to Nintendo's main mascot and the last major 3D platformer we got from Mario are perhaps a bit unfair, but relevant considering that the team who worked on DK Bananza stemmed from the same team that made Super Mario Odyssey, and that's before getting into all the gameplay similarities between the two.</p>



<p>In his review of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, Wccftech's Nathan Birch, giving the game a 9/10 said, "<em>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</em>"</p>
