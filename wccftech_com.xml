			<p>The Pok√©mon Company hosted a Pok√©mon Presents event today, which had a slew of announcements, including a new mobile game called Pok√©mon Friends that's out on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 and mobile devices, a 2026 release window for Pok√©mon Champions, and a new story trailer for the highly-anticipated Pok√©mon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Starting with the brand-new game that was announced, Pok√©mon Friends is a new puzzle game that can be played on iOS and Android mobile devices, or on your Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 system. It's a puzzle game that includes 2D and 3D puzzles, all in the service of creating your own plush room that you can stuff to the brim with Pok√©mon paraphernalia. </p>



<p>"<em>Solve puzzles and get your daily 'aha' moment,</em>" the trailer proclaims, as Pok√©mon Friends is seemingly the latest in The Pok√©mon Company's line of mobile games it wants people checking in on daily, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sms37W1x3-M">Pok√©mon TCG</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbW585_nTj0">Pok√©mon Sleep</a>. And speaking of those mobile games, there were also announcements for the above two, along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4YBHig-wfA">Pok√©mon GO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLBCN7LsQkY">Pok√©mon Unite</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_GOGmkusY">Pok√©mon Masters EX</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBoDsuE1t0Q">Pok√©mon Caf√© ReMix</a>. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>There were also two announcements on the adaptation front, with new episodes announced for the Netflix series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzL8NUUgwdc">Pok√©mon Concierge</a>, and the reveal of a brand new stop-motion animated show, Pok√©mon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd &amp; Pichu. </p>

<p>It's being developed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.aardman.com/">Aardman</a>, a stop-motion animation studio that has worked on films, television series, and video games for the last 40 years. You've seen their work if you've ever seen films, shows and games from series like Wallace &amp; Gromit, Chicken Run, and Shaun the Sheep. The only downside is that it won't arrive until sometime in 2027, so we still have some time to wait for its launch. </p>



<p>Pok√©mon Champions being shown off was one of the other highlights in the presentation, which is also releasing on Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and mobile devices. A gameplay overview dug into various elements of the game, including how battles, training, and recruiting Pok√©mon work. It's another title that doesn't have a 2025 arrival point, as it'll launch sometime in <strong>2026</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">Pok√©mon Legends Z-A</a> getting a story trailer was what The Pok√©mon Company closed the event on, showing off more gameplay of it running on Nintendo Switch 2, and of course digging into the plot's narrative, and what appears to be the main conflict of the plot, that Pok√©mon are mega-evolving on their own, causing danger and chaos across Lumiose City. Which also reveals new mega-evolutions, like Mega-Dragonite.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There was also the reveal of a Nintendo Switch 2 bundle including Pok√©mon Legends Z-A, which will be available when the game launches on October 16, 2025.</p>

<p>Lastly, the other key highlight from the show was more information about the Pok√©mon Kanto theme park, which is due to be open "<em>soon</em>," which is being built in Tokyo, Japan, in an amusement park called Yomuriland. Over 600 Pok√©mon will be featured in the park, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemons-upcoming-theme-park-was-inspired-by-isolation-during-the-pandemic-says-junichi-masuda/">according to</a> The Pok√©mon Company chief creative fellow, Junichi Masuda.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As one of the longest Pok√©mon Presents events in the history of this showcase, it delivered on having enough announcements to fill up the 24-minute runtime. </p>



<p>This year's previous Pok√©mon Presents event was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">dedicated look at Pok√©mon Legends Z-A</a>, which also announced the October release date, and promised that the Switch 2 version of the game will feature "<em>improved graphics and frame rates</em>," which sounds great, but hopefully it doesn't mean that the Nintendo Switch version of the game will be anything like previous Pok√©mon games in terms of <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-update-late-february-bug-fixes-functionality/">performance</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Electronic Arts has confirmed that Battlefield 6 will receive its reveal trailer on Thursday, July 24 at 8 AM Pacific Time/11 AM Eastern Time/5 PM Central European Time. The trailer's official tagline is:</p>



<p><em>Prepare for the ultimate all-out warfare experience in Battlefield 6.</em></p>



<p>A few days ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-rumored-unveil-3-day-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got word</a> from insiders and content creators that a reveal event was on the way. Yesterday, some enterprising users <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> that DICE and EA are preparing an Open Beta to go live in early August, providing players with the first public hands-on experience with Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Granted, a few lucky Battlefield Labs testers already got their hands on the game in the past few months. Several videos even <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked out</a>, showing promising content and features for the next iteration in the military shooter IP.</p>



<p>Back in April, the development teams (of which there are four dedicated to Battlefield 6: DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect Studios) <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked</a> about the renewed importance of destructibility in the game, which will allow players to shape the environment to their needs to gain a tactical advantage. Furthermore, rubble will stay on the map, potentially becoming useful for cover and protection.</p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, Battlefield 6 will also include a full-fledged single-player campaign. Motive Studios is handling this story, which will be thematically <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> by movies like Civil War and TV shows like Lioness.</p>



<p>The hype for this reveal is certainly enormous among fans, especially after the disappointing Battlefield 2042. Publisher Electronic Arts also has massive expectations, with rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing</a> to a $400 million budget that EA hopes will be recouped and more with a target 100 million player base.</p>



<p>EA previously said the game would launch within this fiscal year, but if there really is an Open Beta coming in the next couple of weeks, the release date may be relatively soon. Stay tuned on Wccftech to get all the official Battlefield 6 details on July 24.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-playstation-5-port-is-still-happening-but-may-release-later-than-originally-planned-%E2%80%93-rumor.1249854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the lack of an announcement, the rumored Starfield Playstation 5 port is reportedly still happening, but it could take a while longer to launch.</p>



<p>Replying to a follower's question on X regarding the long-rumored port of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda, known insider NateTheHate stated that the port is still happening, but the release may have been slightly delayed than originally planned. The insider added that a proper update on the matter will be provided when possible.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Still happening; but release may have slipped a touch later than originally planned. Will update when I can.</p>‚Äî NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1947449269893665134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The Starfield PlayStation 5 port releasing later than initially planned, while disappointing for those who are waiting to experience Bethesda's latest big role-playing game, is not exactly surprising, as it isn't the only project related to the game that will take longer to release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/">A few days ago</a>, NateTheHate revealed that a second DLC is in the works, but it's unlikely to be released this year. If this DLC ends up being more substantial than the Shattered Space DLC, bringing new features that could improve the base game's experience as well, it wouldn't be surprising for Bethesda to launch the port alongside the new expansion, which could be called <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>.</p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my review.</p>
