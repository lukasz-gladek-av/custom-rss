			<p>Hello Games is back today with a new No Man's Sky update called RELICS. As you might assume from its title, this patch introduces a way for players to become palaeontologists. They'll be able to excavate the skeletal remains of alien creatures that once inhabited the various worlds. As they discover new bones, players can then assemble them according to their own designs. They can even create their own museums or share their collections with other players.</p>
<p>There is a huge variety of procedurally generated prehistoric bones of all shapes and sizes to excavate and collect. It's up to the No Man's Sky community to assemble them, and the studio reckons fans will have a lot of fun creating increasingly outrageous skeletons to display in their bases-turned-museums or share with other players.</p>
<p>The relics out there to be discovered vary in rarity, so you never know what you're going to unearth. There's a real thrill when you find something really rare. The most unusual finds are worth a lot, too, and for those looking to complete the collection, Hello Games introduced a specialist to barter with at the Space Station.</p>
<p>A new RELICS themed community expedition will be launched soon, focusing on palaeontology and challenging players to compete for the rarest finds. This expedition also unlocks an exclusive living fossil companion, which was described as a loyal, fleshless creature of animated bone.</p>
<p>That said, it won't be just a simple matter of collecting old bones. Sometimes, there might even be dangerous creatures guarding some of these treasures, such as Stone Spirits, the Stone Golem, and the skeletal Titan Worm.</p>

<p>Hello Games then said the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/massive-update-releases-for-no-mans-sky-adding-new-storyline-deep-sea-diving-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Part II</a> update saw No Man's Sky spike to some of its highest player figures at this time of the year. Overall, the game continues to improve and expand at a steady rate. Meanwhile, the community's sentiment grows ever stronger, as evidenced by the fact that its user reviews <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are finally 'Very Positive'</a> on average after years in the Mostly Negative and Mixed ranges.</p>
