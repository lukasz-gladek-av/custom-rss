			<p>The Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Kickstarter campaign is launching today to further expand the action role-playing game in development by The Farm 51 with new features, including a highly requested one.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, The Farm 51 listened to and analyzed fan feedback regarding the game, noticing how the switch from the first-person combat view of the first entry in the series to the new third-person perspective of the sequel was the most critical issue. As such, the studio decided to fix the issue by introducing a switchable third-person and first-person combat perspective, but to do so, it is asking fans for support. More information on the fundraising campaign can be found on the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefarm51/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-an-open-world-sci-fi-rpg/">Kickstarter page.</a></p>
<p>To celebrate the beginning of the Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Kickstarter campaign, The Farm 51 also released a new gameplay trailer showcasing some of the game's most prominent features. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

			<p>Today, NC America (the US publishing division of NCSoft) announced Blade &amp; Soul NEO, an Unreal Engine 4 remaster of the classic Wuxia-themed MMORPG originally released in 2016. The game will be released soon in Europe and North America via NCSoft's PURPLE platform, with pre-registration already open <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/opt-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. As an incentive, pre-registration provides access to a visually enhanced character outfit, some in-game currency, and other perks.</p>
<p>Here are the official features as they were shared in the press release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remastered Graphics and Animations</strong> - NCSOFT’s graphic overhaul of the original MMORPG highlights enhanced textures and lighting, improved animations, and more environmental details and atmosphere. The team took full advantage of Unreal Engine 4’s took kit, faithfully retaining the original game’s stylized visual details and distinct charm that attracted players in the original.</li>
<li><strong>New Feature: Infinite Windwalk + Limitless Exploration</strong> - Obtainable from the start of the game, “Windwalk”, once limited to a stamina bar, is now infinite and can be used as a new mode of long-form transportation. Players will be able to reach high speeds, jump higher, and even perform dynamic acrobatics.</li>
<li><strong>New Feature: New Skill Customization -</strong> This new system enables players to enhance combat customization with more ways to expand their own distinct fighting style. Through gameplay, players earn Skill Books with unique benefits that can be applied to build custom combat techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Action-Based Combat</strong> - Blade &amp; Soul NEO's action-based combat enables players to truly feel like a martial artist, with ability combos, counters, and flexible party roles. Likened to some of the combat systems traditionally found in fighting games, Blade &amp; Soul NEO offers a real skill-based combat system. With fluid movements and stunning effects, one can prove their martial prowess through mastery of their timing and split-second reactions to their enemies’ attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive PvP</strong> - Players can engage in numerous different PVP activities, ranging from Field Combat and Faction Combat to organized 6v6 Battlegrounds.<br>
• Field Combat: There are designated areas on the World Map where, once entered, everyone but your Party Members are flagged for PVP.<br>
• Faction Combat: Early in the game, players choose one of two factions. During the campaign, if players are wearing their Faction Costume, they can kill players of the opposing faction. This is PvP mode is opt-in.<br>
• 6v6 Battleground: Organized PVP played at pre-set hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO also features an extensive and highly customizable character creation tool where players can stylize their hair, facial structures, eye color, height, and body, among many other options. Their character template can then be exported and shared with friends.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the game was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/blade-and-soul-unreal-engine-4-update-lands-on-september-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated to Unreal Engine 4</a> some three years ago, but this remaster does add some other features. Whether that will be enough to reignite interest in the MMORPG remains to be seen.</p>
