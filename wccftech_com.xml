			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has just reported its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors">third-quarter financial results</a> for its 2025 fiscal year, which covers the last three months of 2025, ending right at the end of the year on December 31, 2025. This is an important distinction to make, only because these results do not include all of the layoffs and restructuring that happened at the start of this year when the company announced its "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>."</p>



<p>This means that Ubisoft went forward with its plan to reorganize the entire structure of the company and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">layoff hundreds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">workers across</a> multiple of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">its global branches</a> and its own <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">headquarters in Paris</a> while the company was actually doing well on paper. The company reported <strong>double-digit growth</strong> in the quarter, with net bookings coming in at <strong>€338 million,</strong> a <strong>12% increase</strong> from the third quarter of its previous fiscal year.</p>



<p>It was the "<em>overperformance</em>" of the <strong>Assassin's Creed </strong>franchise that drove the increase, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-hands-on/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong> and <strong>The Division</strong> helping push the increase behind it. Its new historical sim, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></strong>, was able to deliver net bookings that outpaced its predecessor, <strong>Anno 1800</strong>. Though its only major live service title, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-10-year-anniversary-celebration-interview-joshua-mills-alex-karpazis-ubisoft-montreal/">Rainbow Six Siege</a></strong>, did not exceed or fall below expectations, it simply landed where Ubisoft thought it would, which Ubisoft partially attributes to a "<em>particularly crowded</em>" first-person shooter market.</p>



<p>"<em>We delivered a solid third-quarter performance, with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on-year, exceeding our expectations</em>," said Ubisoft chief executive officer and the guy who recently installed <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">his son in one of the company's highest-ranking positions</a>, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>. "<em>This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players</em>."</p>



<p>Guillemot went on to say that the company is "<em>making progress on the transformation announced in January</em>," with key positions within the new structure still being filled, with some of the roles set to be filled by <em>"external hires of experienced, respected industry veterans</em>." Which sounds exactly like <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">the kinds of people they lost</a> in this restructuring, either through layoffs or <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">individuals looking towards greener pastures</a>.</p>



<p>The one bit of forward-looking news we got was that the release date for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/">The Division Resurgence</a></strong> is set to be revealed "<em>soon</em>," according to the report, with no mention of the long-rumoured <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remastered-art-book-listing-spotted-on-amazon-uk-with-march-2026-release/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></strong> remake/remaster, or anything else coming up from the Assassin's Creed franchise.</p>
