			<p>The confirmation that <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was indeed a playable character in <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a>, as promised by CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem, was a soothing balm for series fans - especially after they saw what he looks like in the game.</p>



<p>Requiem takes place much further in the timeline. Thirty years have passed since the bombing of <strong>Raccoon City</strong>, when Leon was a rookie police officer who had a very bad first day at the local Police Department in <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> (canonically set in 1998) and barely escaped with his life. He later appeared in <strong>Resident Evil 4</strong> (canonically set in 2004) as an elite agent reporting directly to the president of the United States, and in <strong>Resident Evil 6</strong> (which takes place in 2013, according to the official timeline), he's still providing security for the president. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set in 2028 in the game's canon. Leon is now 51, so he's much older than when we last saw him, and yet <strong>his 'hot uncle' appearance was very well received by fans</strong>. How did that come about, though?</p>



<p>Automaton recently <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">participated in a joint media interview with CAPCOM</a>, where Game Director <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong> revealed <strong>it had a lot to do with the female staff taking care of his design</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals. Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details, like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, the women developers at Capcom did a really good job (laughs). Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone’s heart throb</em>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, the development team did not just focus on making him look good even at his age. They also had to come up with their own take on how his personality developed over the years; on that note, Nakanishi said <strong>every staff member had their own ideas on what Leon would and would not do in a given situation</strong>. Many discussions ensued, and eventually the developers agreed on how he should behave. </p>



<p>It won't take long before fans can judge this aspect, too. Resident Evil Requiem <strong>is out in less than a month</strong> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read our comprehensive info roundup here</a></strong>; if you need more Leon footage, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-leon-gameplay-ps5-pro-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check this story</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Is Out Now on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, But Nintendo Censored It]]></title>

			<p>The excellent adventure game <strong>Dispatch</strong> has just launched on <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as we already knew from last month's Australian eShop listing</a>. However, users quickly noticed that the game featured a lot of censorship mandated by platform holder Nintendo.</p>



<p>Those who played the game know that, at a certain point, protagonist <strong>Robert Robertson III</strong> (played by <strong>Aaron Paul</strong> and also known as <strong>Mecha Man</strong>) helps fellow hero and potential love interest <strong>Blonde Blazer</strong> with fitting a dress when a rogue nipple slips out of it. Well, that's censored in these versions of the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blonde-Blazer-Censored-Nipple-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>That's far from the only occurrence. Nintendo even censored curse words, 'bleeping' them out, and <strong>there is no way for an adult gamer to override the censorship</strong>, which is very disappointing. Users have pointed out that Nintendo has hentai games on its eShop, and yet this game is being censored for no real reason. </p>



<p>In the launch press release, Dispatch developer <strong>Ad Hoc Studio</strong> only provided this statement:</p>



<p><em>Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.</em></p>



<p>Dispatch <strong>is a fantastic game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dominated our Wccftech Awards '25 in the Best Adventure Game category</a></strong>, but if you own any other platform, we'd recommend playing it there instead to get the full experience.</p>



<p>If you do absolutely need to buy it on Nintendo platforms, though, know that there is a free upgrade from Switch 1 to Switch 2. The latter version features a substantial boost in visual clarity, as you'd expect, <strong>offering 1440P resolution and 60 frames per second</strong>, while the Switch 1 is <strong>locked at 720P resolution and 30 frames per second</strong>.</p>
