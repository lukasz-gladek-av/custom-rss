			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is having an incredible launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">selling 3.5 million units</a> in just four days, and selling twice as fast as the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to that incredible launch, Circana analyst and executive director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrj7u74vi22v">Mat Piscatella just reported</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 set a new record for launch week sales in the US, selling 1.1 million units in its first week on the US market, which beat out the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Piscatella also reported that <strong>79%</strong> of players who bought a Switch 2 during its launch week also bought Mario Kart World, either through the console bundle or separately. Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were the next two best-selling Switch 2 games behind Mario Kart World.</p>

<p lang="en">Nintendo Switch 2 set a new all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US, with over 1.1 million units sold during the week ending June 7, 2025 (excludes sales from the My Nintendo Store). The record was previously held by PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lrj7u74vi22v?ref_src=embed">2025-06-13T19:57:22.329Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Everyone expected the Switch 2's launch to be a major event for the year, but no one could have expected it to do this well so quickly. It'll be interesting to see how well sales keep pace throughout the rest of the year, and if the Switch 2 will be able to set even more records by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>While no one could have expected the Switch 2 to do this well, it's also not the biggest surprise. The new handheld has been extremely well-received by critics and fans alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">In his review, Wccftech's Chris Wray wrote</a>, "<em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy</em>."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">Stellar Blade</a> has been a huge success for its independent developer, Shift Up, which was previously a mobile game developer before it embarked on making a triple-A action game. With a sequel confirmed to be on the way, and Shift Up still working on the mobile series that helped grow the studio in the first place, the future should be incredibly bright for Shift Up.</p>
<p>And it largely still is, but some of the company's investors are fearful that Shift Up could lose its independence, putting a fog over the future of the studio and its current path. According to a report from the South Korean publication <a href="https://g-enews.com/article/ICT/2025/04/202504141448301089c5fa75ef86_1">Global Economic</a> (spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-ups-independence-at-risk-due-to-tencent-ties-investors-fear/">Automaton</a>), Shift Up's investors are concerned with how narrow the split is between Shift Up chief executive officer Hyung-Tae Kim's shares and Tencent's.</p>
<p>Hyung-Tae Kim currently owns 39% of the studio, while Tencent is just under 5% behind him, owning 34.58% of Shift Up. The concern is that Tencent could overtake Hyung-Tae Kim by buying up more shares, and combined with the fact that Tencent is the company Shift Up works with to publish its mobile games, the studio could lose its power to make decisions for itself.</p>
<p>Tencent has been making strategic investments in companies across the video game industry for years now, with their fingers in the pies of studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">Ubisoft</a>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/"> Remedy</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-china-tencent/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-become-funcoms-largest-single-shareholder/">Funcom</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/">FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa</a>. In the case of Riot Games, Tencent outright <a href="http://wccftech.com/tencent-buys-the-rest-of-riot-games-owns-league-of-legends-maker-outright/">bought the studio after consistently increasing its stake</a>.</p>
<p>It's still too early to tell if Shift Up is in real trouble of being acquired by Tencent, but considering that Tencent is a key factor in Shift Up's revenue through the studio's mobile games, and how close Tencent is to being the studio's largest shareholder, it does feel like Tencent is primed to add Shift Up to its internal portfolio of studios.</p>

			<p>KRAFTON revealed that inZOI, the life simulation game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> a few months ago in early access, has received its official ModKit update. Users can now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/inzoi-modkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> the tool via the Epic Games Store to craft and share mods.</p>
<p>The ModKit includes official plugins for the 3D design tools Maya and Blender, making it easier to create custom 3D assets. Players can upload their mods to CurseForge, a modding community platform operated by Overwolf, where they can be saved as separate files and shared freely.</p>
<p>Last month, KRAFTON announced plans to update inZOI’s modding features in three stages throughout the year. Alongside the inZOI ModKit, the update that's now live introduces modding tools for outfit sets and furniture and a data editor to simplify the editing of game data. The September update will introduce modding features for character appearances, architectural elements, and interaction-based content. Lastly, the December update will empower players to create deeper and more diverse content by enabling them to edit scripts and access localization tools.</p>
<p>To bolster the inZOI modding ecosystem, KRAFTON is hosting two global contests this month. In collaboration with CurseForge, the 'Next Top Modder' hackathon will be open from 19 June to 1 August, with modders competing for a share of $11,000 and a chance to have their creations featured as official in-game content. Categories include Best Dress Set, Best Furniture Mod, Community Favorite, and Most Mods Submitted.</p>
<p>KRAFTON is also collaborating with CONNECT, a 3D fashion creator platform operated by CLO Virtual Fashion, to launch the ‘Every Style Starts with You’ outfit design contest, also running from 19 June to 1 August. 15 winning entries will eventually be selected, with up to $26,200 in prizes available. The contest invites creators to design complete outfits, with categories including Ready-to-Wear, Fun &amp; Playful Designs, and Conceptual Outfits inspired by fantasy worlds and imaginative storytelling.</p>

<p>CEO CH Kim stated:</p>
<p><em>With the inZOI ModKit update, we’ve laid the groundwork for players to take the lead in shaping the game’s narrative. We will continue to make updates to the game based on various player feedback.</em></p>
<p>The developers haven't planned any Steam Workshop integration for the time being. However, they may reconsider the feature depending on community demand.</p>
