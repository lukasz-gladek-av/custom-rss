			<p>11 Bit Studios has announced the console launch date for Frostpunk 2, which will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles on <strong>September 18, 2025</strong>. </p>



<p>While the release date was announced with a new trailer for the console's launch, it seems like the news has accidentally gone live early, since the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whxlgvwTZIk"> trailer published to YouTube is now set to private</a>. That doesn't mean you can't see the trailer elsewhere, since it was still downloaded and published by others before it was private.</p>



<p>And to match the fact that Frostpunk 2 is available in Xbox Game Pass for PC, it'll be available in Xbox Game Pass for console players when it launches in September.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Frostpunk 2 | Console Date Reveal Trailer</p><p>Coming to Day One on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on September 18th, 2025 <a href="https://t.co/oOaop5H5ow">pic.twitter.com/oOaop5H5ow</a></p></div>— VGT Gaming News (@GAMERNEWSonX) <a href="https://twitter.com/GAMERNEWSonX/status/1948392802900979880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Along with the console launch, there are still <a href="https://wccftech.com/11-bit-studios-reveals-revised-roadmap-for-frostpunk-2-console-ports-arriving-in-summer/">two more DLC expansions </a>currently scheduled to arrive before the end of this year as part of a previously revealed roadmap for the game, and a third, unnamed DLC set to arrive in 2026.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate for 11 Bit Studios that an announcement which seemingly wasn't meant to go live today has done so, but exciting for console players who have been eagerly awaiting its arrival on PS5 and Xbox Series devices since the game first launched on PC last September to strong reviews. </p>



<p>Wccftech's Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/">adored it when he reviewed it last year</a>, writing, "<em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others."</em></p>

			<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6ogkWkxq1HusqpqGtQvCpn/assassins-creed-shadows-summer-roadmap-update">announced</a> its summer update for the Assassin's Creed Shadows roadmap, including the reveal that new game plus is getting added to the game next week, the player level cap is getting an increase, and the Claws of Awaji DLC is launching on <strong>September 16, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>As far as what's coming next week, on July 29, 2025, Ubisoft is pushing an update for Assassin's Creed Shadows that will add new game plus, a level cap increase from 60 to 80, and some new Animus-related collectibles, and the arrival of Project 3. For new game plus, it'll be available once you've played through the final story mission and seen the credits roll, and all your gear, hideout progression, skill points, and character level will stay the same when starting a new game plus run. Discovered location, objective, and storyboard progression will all be reset. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Later in the summer in August, Ubisoft will push another update that adds a few quality of life updates players have been asking for, like being able to unfog the entire map by synchronizing every viewpoint in the game, and for PC players, Ubisoft is uncapping the framerate in cutscenes, so the game won't be swapping back and forth between a capped and uncapped framerate. Ubisoft is also giving players the chance to voice their concerns and feedback directly to the development team, with a Reddit AMA set for August 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The last highlight of today's announcement is the Claws of Awaji release date, set for September 16, 2025. This is also when a few more quality of life updates will go live, like being able to swap the time of day on the fly, and plenty of new gear rarities and equipment that'll come alongside the DLC.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ubisoft celebrated Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/">hitting 5 million players</a> since launch, amid one of the company's other major franchises, Rainbow Six Siege, performing below expectations.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Release Date Indirectly Confirmed by Official Website]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/</link>

			<p>Yesterday, renowned leaker billbill-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> details on the Battlefield 6 release date. According to the insider, the game would be released on October 10, priced at €69.99/79.99 for the Standard Edition and €99.99/109.99 for the Phantom Edition, with the PC version being €10 cheaper as with most games.</p>



<p>Today, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut trailer</a> and the news that the reveal event would take place on July 31, eagle-eyed spotter Wario64 has already <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1948404850288427225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> some fine print on the official Battlefield 6 website that practically confirms the aforementioned release date as correct.</p>



<p>On the legal disclaimers, it is confirmed that pre-order offers will expire on October 10, which makes perfect sense if that's the game's release date. Moreover, the codes can be redeemed for two years through October 10, 2027, as with most games. If rumors are to be believed, fans should get their hands on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta test</a> much earlier than that, though, possibly in early August.</p>



<p>As to the game itself, the developers did not reveal much today, except that the bad guys are the so-called Pax Armata, a private military corporation 'bankrolled by former NATO states' whose agenda threatens to plunge the world into global conflict. This sets the stage for what players can expect on the battlefield, in both multiplayer and the series's return to a single-player campaign, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being handled by Motive Studios</a>. </p>



<p>The press release also confirms a veritable return to the core tenets of the franchise in Battlefield 6: visceral combat, epic warfare, and player freedom. Players will be able to blow through walls, bring down entire buildings, and take to the skies in dogfights for a tactical advantage, but working together with your squad will still be the secret to victory.</p>



<p>Next week, all will be revealed through a series of live events taking place in Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris, and London, with another scheduled in Singapore on August 2. We'll have Kai on the ground in LA to report his first impressions on the long-awaited next chapter in the Battlefield series. Stay tuned for his hands-on!</p>
