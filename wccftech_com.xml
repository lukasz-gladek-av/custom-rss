			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/electronic-arts/">EA</a> has announced the release dates for both Madden NFL 26 and EA Sports College Football 26, and confirmed that there will be no Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions of both games, leaving behind the last-gen versions five years after the launch of the current generation.</p>
<p>EA Sports College Football 26 will launch on&nbsp;<strong>July 10, 2025</strong> and will be available three days earlier for players who purchase early access through the Deluxe Edition, while Madden NFL 26 will arrive on <strong>August 14, 2025,</strong> and will also be available three days earlier for those who grab the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>If you were already planning on grabbing both games, EA has a<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/bundles/mvp-bundle/buy"> bundle</a> you can grab that'll get you both games when they release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Madden 26 &amp; College Football 26 Announce Trailer | The Call" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIp9SMjNH1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition for Madden NFL 26 nabs you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 Madden Points</li>
<li>Season 1 Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Cover Athlete Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Superstar Legendary XP Boost</li>
<li>Franchise Coach ability points</li>
<li>Player card exclusive item</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Deluxe Edition for EA Sports College Football 26 gets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 College Football Points</li>
<li>Top Prospect Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>All Hands Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>Dynasty Coach Points</li>
<li>Road to Glory Skill Points</li>
</ul>
<p>The MVP Bundle, which is what you'll want to get if you were getting both games anyway, gets you all of the above along with a few bundle exclusive items for either game. If you pre-order the bundle ahead of April 29, 2025, you'll always get the Travis Hunter 99 OVR player item in both Madden NFL 26 and College Football 26.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> was a smash-success for EA last year, with the series returning after being on hiatus for a decade. It'll be interesting to see if that same success can be repeated, or even surpassed this year. Sports games are a consistent seller every year, and it's doubtful that the same fans who flooded to buy the first official college football video game in 10 years are satiated by just one new release.</p>

			<p>During a special livestream that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just aired</a>, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment announced the final release date for its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak. The cooperative first-person shooter game for up to three players will be launched for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on June 17, priced at $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it will also be available on day one via Microsoft's PC Game Pass/Game Pass Ultimate and Sony's PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers in a bid to maximize the player base from the get-go.</p>
<p>Remedy is also releasing a Deluxe Edition, priced at&nbsp;$49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99. This edition includes exclusive cosmetic items and voice packs that allow players to customize their audiovisual identity.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak Deluxe Edition includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li>Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li>Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li>Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items, including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Owners of the base game can upgrade to the Deluxe Edition at any time for $10.00 / €10.00 / £7.00.</p>

<p>During today's live stream, Remedy also briefed fans on the post-launch support. Two new Jobs (missions) will be released later in 2025, while even more updates will be made available throughout 2026. As the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, all post-launch content will be free, and monetization will be limited to cosmetic-only items.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is powered by Remedy's proprietary Northlight engine, previously seen in Control and Alan Wake 2. However, being a multiplayer game first and foremost, the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken care to optimize it</a> to be more accessible to a wider range of PC configurations. Even so, high-end features like path tracing (already implemented in Alan Wake 2) and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be supported on PC.</p>
