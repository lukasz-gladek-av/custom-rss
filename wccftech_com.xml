			<p>Back in April, ARC Raiders and Marathon both hosted playtests that coincidentally overlapped with each other, and according to Embark Studios' technical director, while that was entirely a coincidence, it proved beneficial for ARC Raiders and for Embark Studios.</p>



<p>Embark Studios just got done hosting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">'Server Slam Test' this past weekend</a>, where the game was available for free on all platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S) for players to hop into from October 17-19. As far as we know, it went well, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2427520/charts/">game's Steam concurrent players peaking at 189,668</a>, and it'll be interesting to see what Embark Studios takes from this playtest to implement in the final game.</p>



<p>Some learnings however didn't come from feedback on ARC Raiders at all. When speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">PC Gamer</a>, technical director on ARC Raiders, Virgil Watkins, admitted that Marathon overlapping playtest worked as a good compare and contrast for what Embark Studios was doing with ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>"<em>It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen</em>," said Watkins. "<em>It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours</em>."</p>



<p>Watkins doesn't identify any concrete examples, or claim that he and the rest of Embark Studios have been watching over Marathon like hawks, but it makes perfect sense that both teams would be eying each other, if only because they're both making extraction shooters.</p>



<p>While this past weekend's server slam test was undoubtedly popular, it'll be interesting to see how ARC Raiders does when it's on shelves. Unlike Embark Studios other major title, The Finals, it is not a free-to-play experience, so it doesn't have that same appeal of players being able to just give the game a try to see how they like it.</p>



<p>And with regards to Marathon, we know that Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">is hosting a closed test later this month</a> that is invite-only and under an NDA, though the future for that game is far more uncertain than the future for ARC Raiders.</p>

			<p>Following the launch of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally handhelds, not to mention the rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft's own handheld projects are dead in the water</a>, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Variety</a> that the company is absolutely still looking at making new hardware in the future: </p>



<p><em>We are 100% looking at making things in the future. We have our next-gen hardware in development. We’ve been looking at prototyping, designing. We have a partnership we’ve announced with AMD around it, so that is coming. What we saw here was an opportunity to innovate in a new way and to bring gamers another choice, in addition to our next-gen hardware. We are always listening to what players and creators want. When there is demand for innovation, we’re going to build it.</em></p>



<p>Specifically with regards to the Xbox/Windows handheld experience, Bond said Microsoft is already looking at many software improvements:</p>



<p><em>There’s a ton more innovation to come, including things like further optimizing the experience here, scaling out the handheld compatibility program, offering more benefits and improvements to the experience and other features and adds that we’re going to give to people and more choices and more games.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the ROG Xbox Ally X got a 7.5 out of 10 score. Reviewer David Carcasole pointed the high price and lack of support for actual Xbox games as negatives:</p>



<p><em>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful, capable, and comfortable PC handheld device, with a smooth user experience thanks to the new Xbox UI. It's really like taking your computer on the go, with all of your PC games in your hands. For its mix of improved hardware, user experience, and battery efficiency, it's arguably the best PC handheld device to buy on the market. It's not an entirely smooth experience though, with plenty of PC gaming hiccups interrupting the 'console-like' experience the device is supposed to provide, the fact that it actually doesn't let you play all your Xbox games, and what I still believe to be an exorbitant price tag, when cheaper devices can provide comparable experiences.</em></p>

			<p>EA is shutting down The Sims Mobile on January 20, 2026, with the game set to receive a final update today (October 20) followed by a series of limited-time events from now until just before the shutdown on January 20.</p>



<p>The Sims Mobile first launched on March 6, 2018, and by January 21, 2026, after seven years of updates and content that players paid for, the game will be rendered entirely unplayable. A post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/515222130291376715?l=english">official X (formerly Twitter) account announced the news</a> of the game's shutdown, but <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update">a blog post on the official EA website</a> further dug into what this shutdown means.</p>



<p>Unlike previous examples of games being shut down where they will available to players who still have the game downloaded and on their device, not only will The Sims Mobile be unavailable for players to redownload from their library after January 20, it won't be playable for those who have it downloaded. </p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey Simmers,</p><p>We have some sad news today. After seven years and more than 50 updates, The Sims Mobile is releasing its final update. From January 20, 2026, at 1:59 PM UTC, TSM will no longer be accessible to play and will be sunset.</p><p>From today, all in-app purchases have been… <a href="https://t.co/quUA1UcPzF">pic.twitter.com/quUA1UcPzF</a></p></div>— The Sims Mobile (@TheSimsMobile) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSimsMobile/status/1980122238981665180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The game's servers are shutting down as of 1:59pm UTC, making the game entirely unplayable and players saved data inaccessible. The game will be delisted from digital stores tomorrow, October 21, and as of today, players can no longer make in-game purchases for The Sims Mobile. On January 6, 2026, the entire content library for the game will be unlocked for players, giving anyone still around free reign with all of the game's content for two weeks, before it disappears forever.</p>



<p>There's no explanation or even a suggestion as to why The Sims Mobile is shutting down after seven years. The blog post concludes with the development team writing, "<em>On behalf of the entir</em><em>e Sims Mobile</em> team, thank you for sharing this amazing journey with us. We hope you enjoy the final update and that these final months allow everyone to finish projects, make memories, and celebrate their Sims."</p>



<p>What might be a reason for its departure, however, is the coming of a new Sims mobile game to take its place. Last year, per a report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/ea-only-plans-to-make-concentrated-bets-in-mobile-following-a-flurry-of-cancellations/">MobileGamer.Biz</a>, EA briefly spoke about a new Sims mobile game in the works codenamed "<em>Project Stories</em>." A release window was not shared, but it could be the case that we'll see a full reveal for this new title in 2026, hence the shutdown of The Sims Mobile at the start of next year.</p>



<p>Or, it could also be that this is the first of what could be multiple project shutdowns as EA finds a way to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">pay the $20 billion in debt from its $55 billion buyout</a>, and in fact the aforementioned unrevealed Sims mobile game is also set to be cancelled, with development teams waiting to learn if they've been laid off or not.</p>
