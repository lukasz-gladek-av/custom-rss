			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Showcase</a> that will take place at the beginning of next month, developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/">Alkimia Interactive</a> has published its latest 'Making Of' video going behind the scenes on the development of the Gothic Remake, this time focusing on the studio's approach to the game's art style.</p>



<p>"<em>We also decided very early on, we are not making an HD version of the art style of the original, that's not our goal</em>," says the game director and studio head at Alkimia Interactive, Reinhard Pollice, at the top of the video. Pollice and the studio's art director, Daniel Candil, continue to elaborate on how they were working with opposing forces in developing this remake, as they wanted to make it look grounded and realistic, while also properly displaying the more fantastical and magical elements of Gothic.</p>

<p>The Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019 with a surprise teaser demo being released for players to check out. It wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020, however,</a> that we knew for sure that the remake was in development, and it has been in the works ever since. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/">May 2024</a>, we learned that the remake was meant to be out by March 2025, though all we've received so far this year is a new demo that debuted during the year's first Steam Next Fest event in February 2025. Alkimia Interactive has even taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/">feedback from players who checked out the demo</a> and committed to making several significant changes. </p>



<p>Currently, there's still no proper release date set for the Gothic Remake, though it's entirely possible that we'll finally learn of when it'll be on store shelves during the upcoming THQ Nordic Showcase in August.</p>
