            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-steam-console-steam-frame-trademark-rumor/">several rumors</a> surrounding Valve, claiming that the company would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-may-announce-steam-frame/">launching a new VR headset, controller</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-rumored-to-announce-something-big-shortly/">potentially even a new console-like PC</a>, those rumors were proven true today when Valve announced all three of the rumored hardware devices in one big swing. The Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">were all debuted at once, and they're all going to arrive sometime in early 2026</a>.</p>



<p>What has followed since the official reveal is a slew of interviews and videos from publications that got the chance to speak with Valve ahead of the reveal, including a particularly interesting interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-how-did-valve-design-the-steam-machine-it-started-with-the-fan-of-course">Eurogamer</a> where Yazan Aldehayyat, a hardware engineer at Valve, spoke candidly about how the company settled on the design of the Steam Machine.</p>



<p>Before you ask, no, it did not come from Valve wanting to make its own Nintendo GameCube (though that hasn't stopped people online from referring to the device as the Gabe Cube or Steam Cube). It began with Valve seriously considering the cooling and heat challenges that the Steam Machine would face, whether on a person's desk or, more likely, on a TV stand in their living room.</p>



<p>"<em>If you know how much heat you need to remove and what temperatures you're dealing with, then you know how much air you need</em>," said Aldehayyat. "<em>And if you know how much air you need, you can lock in a fan design pretty early on. And if you know how big the fan is, everything else kind of falls [into place] from that</em>."</p>



<p>Aldehayyat goes on to say that "<em>Living rooms are actually one of the most challenging thermal environments you can think of</em>," due to how devices, whether they're consoles or a small media box, are usually tucked into cabinets or surrounded by other sources of heat, and not just things like a TV, but potentially a fireplace warming someone's living room and giving devices like the Steam Machine a greater cooling challenge.</p>



<p>Obviously, Valve can only do so much to try and accommodate for those kinds of variants, but it's not surprising that the design for its new console-like PC came from wanting to both improve on the performance capabilities of a Steam Deck, without shipping a massive device that might as well just be a desktop at a certain point. Besides, Nintendo proved years ago that consoles don't need to be these giant boxes or towering configurations of plastic and technology to be popular and perfect for the living room.</p>



<p>Lastly, just as a comparison, the Steam Machine is 152 mm tall, 162.4 mm deep, and 156 mm wide, while the Nintendo GameCube is 110 mm tall, 161 mm deep, and 150 mm wide. It's flat-out impressive, and a huge sign of how far technology has come, that with a few more millimetres of space compared to a console that launched in 2001, Valve can make a device capable of playing modern games 25 short years later.</p>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-november-grand-theft-auto-v-pacific-drive-still-wakes-the-deep-and-more/">announced the full lineup of games</a> joining the PS Plus Extra Games Catalog for November 2025, and the big headlining title is one that we already expected, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-reportedly-heading-back-to-ps-plus-extra-catalog/">thanks to a leak from last week</a>. As expected, Grand Theft Auto V is indeed making a return to the library of PS Plus Extra titles, and it's doing so alongside BAFTA-winning games like Still Wakes the Deep and Thank Goodness You're Here. </p>



<p>There are eight titles joining the library of PS Plus Extra games, and one game entering the library of PS Plus Premium Classic games. </p>



<p>Starting with the games entering the Extra tier library, while GTA V is the big headlining title that is also re-entering the service ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI launching next year in November 2026, it's not the only interesting title joining the library. Thank Goodness You're Here, for example, is arguably one of the funniest video games ever made and a BAFTA-winning title from 2024.</p>



<p>Pacific Drive is another notable title entering the service, as it excellently captures the Pacific Northwest in a mysterious journey where players build a strong bond with a mystical station wagon that you customize the more you explore. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> is another BAFTA-winning title from 2024 that's entering the library, and another game that's well worth checking out if you haven't already.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games entering the PS Plus Extra Games Library for November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Pacific Drive (PS5)</li>



<li>Thank Goodness You're Here (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>The Talos Principle 2 (PS5)</li>



<li>Insurgency Sandstorm (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Still Wakes the Deep (PS5)</li>



<li>Monster Jam Showdown (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>MotoGP 25 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>



<p>The lone game joining the PS Plus Premium Classics catalog this month is Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which will be playable on PS5 and PS4.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-and-new-steam-controller-all-coming-in-early-2026.1351720/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-rumored-to-announce-something-big-shortly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As hinted by the latest rumors</a>, Valve has just dropped three big announcements: the new Steam Frame Virtual Reality headset, a new Steam Machine, and a new Steam Controller, all of which are coming early next year. No pricing details have been disclosed yet, though.</p>



<p>Let's start with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Frame</a>. The project codenamed Deckard is much more than a mere upgrade of the Valve Index. This is instead a wireless 'streaming-first' headset that features a 6GHz wireless adapter for a dedicated link. Moreover, its dual radios promise to make the connection even more stable, as one radio is dedicated to streaming audio and visuals, while the other connects to the local Wi-Fi network, thus avoiding bandwidth competition.</p>



<p>The headset, designed for both VR and non-VR gaming, can function as a standalone PC, thanks to the 4nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and the SteamOS environment. Equipped with 16GB of Unified LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB/1TB storage options, it supports standalone play on certain games, and you'll see the Steam Frame Verified tag on those games that can work that way, similar to Steam Deck Verified.</p>



<p>The Steam Frame is very light (around 440g, lighter than Meta's Quest devices), has a built-in microphone and high-fidelity audio powered by dual speaker drivers per ear (integrated into the headstrap). Its display's optics support 2160 x 2160 LCD resolution per eye and a refresh rate range of 72-144Hz (with 144Hz currently labeled as experimental). The lenses are custom pancake with a large Field of View of up to 110°, and there's support for IPD (interpupillary distance) customization from 60 to 70 mm.</p>



<p>For VR applications, the Frame takes advantage of inside-out camera-based tracking. This means you won't need to set up cumbersome base stations around the room anymore. Instead, the headset has been designed with four outward-facing monochrome cameras for controller and headset tracking, and two interior cameras for eye tracking and foveated streaming.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You won't need to worry about cumbersome wires or base stations with the new Steam Frame.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The latter is one of the main innovations of the VR gaming experience. By tracking exactly where your gaze is directed, it optimizes detail in that area, offering an improvement in image quality and effective bandwidth of over 10 times. Valve stated that the Steam Frame utilizes low-latency eye-tracking data to direct the highest-quality pixels to the user's line of sight. Foveated streaming will work across all games.</p>



<p>Of course, there are also new controllers that can be used both in VR and non-VR games. For VR games, the controllers support capacitive finger tracking. For traditional games, users will find a D-pad, thumbsticks, triggers, bumpers, and ABXY face buttons. The controllers are powered by AA batteries, which are expected to last approximately 40 hours of playtime.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Next, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Following the ill-fated venture of the first iteration (which launched ten years ago, in November 2015), this new console-like PC is a 6-inch, 2.6kg cube that Valve says is more than six times more powerful than the Steam Deck. It's powered by a semi-custom AMD Zen 4 processor with 6 Cores and 12 Threads. Its frequency goes up to 4.8 GHz and it consumes up to 30W TDP. The GPU is semi-custom, powered by the AMD RDNA3 architecture, and features 28 Compute Units with a maximum sustained clock of 2.45 GHz and a 110W TDP. Memory-wise, there are 16GB of DDR5 RAM and 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM.</p>



<p>Clearly, this is no monster PC. In fact, even the PlayStation 5 Pro has it beat with a combination of RDNA 3 and 4 architecture and a lot more Compute Units (60). That said, it supports up to 4K@60 FPS gaming through AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, according to Valve. One of its perks is that it should run 'whisper quiet' even in the most demanding games. It can even be used as a host PC to stream to other devices, like Steam Link, Steam Deck, or the Steam Frame.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Steam Machine features an LED strip that can be customized through various animations and colors.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Steam Machine is, of course, powered by SteamOS and designed to be paired with the new Steam Controller thanks to a built-in wireless adapter. Users can pair up to four controllers that way, in fact. The hardware will be available with 512GB and 2TB storage options, though it can be further expanded via microSD. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>I/O</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Displays</td><td><strong>DisplayPort 1.4:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining<br><strong>HDMI 2.0:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 120Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, CEC</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>- Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 front<br>- Two USB-A 2.0 High speed back<br>- One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 back</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6C/12T<br>- Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28CUs<br>- 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Two models:<br>- 512GB NVMe SSD<br>- 2TB NVMe SSD<br>- Both include a high-speed microSD slot</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 (dedicated antenna)</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Controller</a> (not to be confused with the controllers for the Steam Frame) features next-generation magnetic thumbsticks powered by TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) technology. They support capacitive touch, enabling motion controls, and include high-definition rumble for an immersive haptic experience. The major new feature is Grip Sense, a new input for the Steam Controller that enables gyro aiming with capacitive touch. Users can hold and release to enable or disable the gyro, and this can also be mapped like any other button.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Steam Controller will include a 'Puck' wireless transmitter and charging station.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The Steam Controller, which weighs 292g and enables up to 35 hours of wireless gameplay, also comes with a 'Puck', a transmitter that enables a fast and stable wireless connection and doubles as a charging station, connecting to the Controller magnetically. Again, the Steam Controller can be used with the Steam Deck, Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and regular PC. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games has been involved in intense <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-returns-to-iphone-in-australia-after-epic-games-wins-legal-battle-against-apple-and-google-marking-major-shift-in-app-store-rules-and-player-freedom/">legal battles with both Apple</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wins-landmark-anticompetitive-lawsuit-against-google-with-unanimous-verdict/">Google for years now</a>, though last week, it seemed like this era of Epic's battles with Google was coming to an end. The two sides <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-google-finally-reach-settlement-open-android-platform-lower-service-fees/">reached a settlement last week</a> that seemed to please everyone involved, and all that was left was for the presiding judge, Judge James Donato, to slap his stamp of approval on the deal.</p>



<p>In the proposed settlement, the Android platform would become more open, and Google would lower its service fees for Google Play. Epic Games chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, called the settlement "<em></em><em>a comprehensive solution</em>" to the dispute and would have definitively concluded the legal battle between the two.</p>



<p>Except Judge James Donato is not exactly convinced that he can approve this settlement, and has a few lingering concerns, including a concern around why Epic and Google, after years of legal vitriol back and forth, "<em>are suddenly BFFs</em>."</p>



<p>Reported by <a href="https://80.lv/articles/epic-games-google-settlement-under-review-as-us-judge-raises-concerns">80 Level</a>, Judge Donato's concern, besides the fact that the two juggernaut companies suddenly seem like best friends, is that the proposed settlement does not reach the legal threshold needed for Judge Donato to revise a court ruling.</p>



<p>"<em>The only changed circumstance that I can see right now is Epic and Google - two mortal enemies who pounded each other relentlessly in this courtroom for many years - are suddenly BFFs</em>," said Donato, per 80 Level.</p>



<p>Another hearing has been set for sometime between December 2025 and January 2026, giving Judge Donato time to review the proposed settlement and its potential implications, should he approve it as it currently is.</p>
