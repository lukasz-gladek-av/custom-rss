			<p>For those who had the chance to play the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sword-and-fairy-7-is-the-latest-stunning-nvidia-rtx-graphical-showcase/">Sword and Fairy games</a> when they were younger, it has now been confirmed that Sword and Fairy 4 is being remade. This has been announced with a debut trailer, which showcases the game with new graphics, as the title has been made in Unreal Engine 5. The developers are using the latest technology to recreate the original Sword and Fairy 4 experience. At the moment, details about this game are very slim. However, it's known that the game will be available on console and PC in the future when it eventually releases.</p>
<p><iframe title="《仙劍奇俠傳四》重製版前導PV（繁中）" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hG4_GqYnKs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This title is being developed by Up Software and published by Cube Game. Again, it's relatively hard to find any information about these studios and their history in the game industry, as it will bring up a lot of irrelevant results on the search engine.</p>
<p>Sword and Fairy 4 is a single-player RPG that is "reborn" using Unreal Engine 5, where you get to go on a journey full of adventure and battle to try and find the immortals with Tianhe Yun's team. On this journey, a hidden truth that has managed to remain hidden away from the public is starting to unravel, with people finding out the truth.</p>
<p>Sword and Fairy as a franchise is the most famous Chinese RPG series, but outside of South East Asia, it's unlikely that you will have heard of it, as it's not widely available internationally. As a result, people have had to turn to emulation and YouTube videos or Twitch streams to see more of Sword and Fairy.</p>
<p>For South East Asian gamers, it's very clear that this franchise means a lot, especially to the Chinese audience. From the comments alone that you can translate via Google, a lot of people are overjoyed and incredibly emotional about the game being remade, showing that the game has had a lot of emotional impact on gamers over the years. Many of the comments even refer to the original game as a masterpiece, so it seems that players are in for a great experience.</p>
<p>As the entire trailer is in Chinese, it's uncertain at the moment whether this game will be available globally or just be accessible to the Asian audience. Minimal details about the game have been revealed, as this is the first sighting of the Sword and Fairy 4 Remake.</p>
<p>The original Sword and Fairy 4 game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621680/Sword_and_Fairy_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on Steam</a>, a title that was first released in 2007. However, if you want to play it, the game is only available in Chinese.</p>

			<p>This week, several Polish websites <a href="https://www.gram.pl/news/microsoft-wycofuje-xboxy-w-polsce-konsola-stala-sie-niedostepna-w-sprzedazy#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Xbox Series X consoles were nowhere to be found in stores. These reports sparked rumors that Microsoft would essentially retire from selling the hardware in the European country.</p>
<p>We reached out to Microsoft and received the following comment from a spokesperson:</p>
<p><em>While we expect to have limited Xbox Series X supply in Poland this holiday due to player demand, Xbox Series S consoles will still be available. Players can visit <a href="http://xbox.com/regions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xbox.com/regions</a> to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
<p>Fans of the Green team have been increasingly antsy following Microsoft's big policy change around first-party games. More games are getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ported</a> to other consoles (chiefly Sony's PlayStation 5) right away, and there's a growing concern that this, coupled with the consistently low sales for the past couple of years, might eventually persuade Microsoft to just give up on its own console ecosystem and focus on making games for all platforms instead.</p>
<p>It does not seem like there's much to worry about on that front for the time being. At the same time, there's no guarantee that the situation will not change in the future.</p>
