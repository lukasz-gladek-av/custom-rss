			<p>Nintendo is bringing back the Virtual Boy. No, really. Nintendo will once again sell the Virtual Boy, this time as an accessory for your Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 device, to play Virtual Boy games through a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-game-boy-game-boy-advance/">Nintendo Switch Online Plus Expansion Pack</a> subscription. It'll be available on February 17, 2026.</p>



<p>The Virtual Boy accessory is required to play any of the Virtual Boy classic titles added to Nintendo Switch Online, as this is technically the latest 'classic console' Nintendo is adding to the subscription. Your Switch or Switch 2 slots into the Virtual Boy headset with the joycons removed, and with your face in the headset, you'll be able to play games like Mario's Tennis, Galactic Pinball, Teleroboxer, and more.</p>



<p>All 14 of the Virtual Boy titles released in North America will be making their way to the subscription service over time, though the three mentioned above were the only ones that showed some gameplay, so expect Mario's Tennis, Galactic Pinball, and Teleroboxer to be among the first games released for the new version of the Virtual Boy when it arrives in February 2026.</p>

<p>You'll have to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber to buy one in the first place, and while it's not clear yet how much it'll cost, there will be a classic cardboard version also available, that will hopefully be cheaper than the plastic version shown in the above trailer.</p>



<p>Whatever the cost, Nintendo has already proven it can <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-labo-vr-kit-announced/">make money by selling cardboard to its players</a>. And while it's great for people who were fans of the headset when it first launched and catastrophically bombed, it can't help but be a little comical, considering that this iteration of Nintendo's foray into VR will last longer than the original did, since it will almost certainly be on sale for longer than a calendar year.</p>

			<p>Resident Evil Requiem, the next entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM announced earlier this year, is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 as well as on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>A new trailer shown during today's Nintendo Direct provided a first look at the Switch 2 version of the game, which seems to look fine despite a noticeable visual downgrade over the other versions of the game and 30 FPS gameplay, and confirmed the game will hit the new generation Nintendo system on February 27, 2026, the same day it launches on the other systems. Additionally, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ports-of-every-re-engine-game-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">rumored</a>, Resident Evil VII Biohazard and Resident Evil Village will also launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day.</p>

<p>Although we have yet to see any combat, Resident Evil Requiem is setting out to be one of the best entries in the series. During Gamescom last month, I had the chance to try out the game, and I was thoroughly impressed by the game's visuals and sound production, which create an amazing atmosphere that will only feel more eerie and scary when I finally will be able to experience the game under the proper conditions in a few months. You can learn more about what else the game seems to be doing really well in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"> preview.</a></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p>
