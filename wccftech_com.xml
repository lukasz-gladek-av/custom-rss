			<p>We're now in August, the launch month for <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-shown-new-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, and the developers have now released a brand new trailer to show off all the available weapon options in the game.</p>



<p>The first one is of course the sword, which allows for fast, 'split-second strikes'. The greatsword, on the other hand, is slower but capable of 'earth-shattering power'. The third weapon is the poleblade, which is said to deliver a 'piercing storm' to enemies. The fourth and final option is the scythe, which enables 'cutting-edge control' of its strikes. The trailer also demonstrates how Lost Soul Aside allows seamless weapons swapping even mid-combo. Players can, for example, launch an enemy in the air with one weapon and then slam it back down with another. </p>



<p>The unique stats of each weapon can significantly influence the player's tactical approach. The weapons can also be enhanced and customized by using special weapon fragments discovered throughout Lost Soul Aside. These fragments can alter the weapons' appearance, enhance combat or healing capabilities, and upgrade Kaser's fighting style. Players can attach fragments to their weapons and experiment with unique combinations to discover thrilling and powerful effects.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside wears its inspiration (mainly games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta) on its sleeve, although technically it is described as having roleplaying elements, too. Indeed, protagonist Kaser will grow even stronger throughout the game by attaining new skills and abilities unlocked via a dedicated Skill Tree. These powerful skills, which can boost damage, enhance healing, and generate protective shields, are granted by the dragon-like creature Arena.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to further intensify attacks with precise, high-impact bursts of strength by timing button presses during weapon combos to achieve devastating results. Finally, the Fusion Gauge can be filled through attack combos and abilities to summon Arenaâ€™s claws and fiercely strike enemies. This upgradeable skill unlocks new combat techniques as Kaser progresses in his mission.</p>



<p>After over ten years of development, the game that started as a solo project by Yang Bing is scheduled to launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 29. You can find the PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>
