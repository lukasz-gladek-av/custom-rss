			<p>Xbox is reportedly working on its Classics programs together with the team behind a popular emulator to bring original Xbox and 360 games to PC and Game Pass, complete with enhancements.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today, known Xbox Game Pass leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eXstas1s</a> revealed that Xbox is working with the Xenia Canary development team on a sort of Classics program to create an emulation platform that will bring old games to Series X and S, PC, Game Pass, and xCloud, complete with visual and performance enhancements. The launch of this program will coincide with the brand's 25th anniversary, and games will reportedly launch in multiple waves that will be announced throughout 2026. Among the games that will launch via this new emulation platform will be Fable 2, Skate 3, Gears of War 3, and Batman: Arkham Asylum. Many other titles, however, are also under consideration, with the team evaluating potential technical and licensing issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="EXCLUSIVA üî• XBOX + XENIA se UNEN para revivir juegos de XBOX 360 en PC, nube y GAME PASS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uub8TghbVSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Considering how much importance Microsoft placed on backward compatibility in the past few years, what Exstas1s revealed today sounds reasonable enough, and pretty exciting as well, as this program would bring to PC games that are not available to play natively, like the aforementioned Fable 2, and the original versions of Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden 2, to name a few. Still, we must take everything with a grain of salt until an official announcement is made.</p>
<p>Though we don't know if Microsoft is indeed working on this Classics program, we do know the company is hard at work on its next-generation hardware. Together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/">AMD</a>, Microsoft is building gaming silicon that will deliver the next generation of graphics innovation with better visual quality, immersive gameplay, and improvements offered by AI while maintaining compatibility with the existing library of Xbox Games.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/">Dune: Awakening</a> has only been out for a little more than a week (even longer if you've been playing since its premium early access release), and players are already looking towards what's coming next for the game.</p>
<p>It'll still be a while before Funcom releases any major content updates, but one element we can expect, according to the studio's community manager, Ignasis Mir√≥ Sastre, is that the team will add more "<em>Hagga-Basin-like</em><em> maps</em>" in future updates.</p>
<p>Writing on the Dune: Awakening Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">Eurogamer</a>), Sastre wrote, "<em>I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content.</em>"</p>
<p>Hagga Basin is the starting area in Dune: Awakening, where players can start finding their <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/">sand legs</a> before traveling further into the desert, and eventually to the deep desert and the game's more PvP-focused areas.</p>
<p>It's an area of the game that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcojf7/to_the_surprise_of_nobody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">players have a strong fondness for</a>, if only because it doesn't have the same potential for the kinds of horror stories players have experienced with a trip into the deep desert. A new area like Hagga Basin would be more than welcomed by Dune: Awakening players, to have that same well-curated exploration on Arrakis that Hagga Basin delivers in a fresh way.</p>
<p>And it'll feel even better since it'll likely be free, as Sastre later comments that "<em>Content will come as part of free updates, as far as I am aware. If it ever comes as part of a paid package, I imagine it would be because it's something big. But for now I think we have said we plan to release content for free, and then optional stuff via optional DLCs so we can actually afford rent, lights, and pineapple on pizza</em>."</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll be able to hear about whatever the next Hagga-Basin-like map is soon, and it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we did, since the studio also just confirmed in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/comment/mymv65a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit AMA</a> that it plans to release PvE-focused content "<em>every 3/4 months</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out,</em>" Funcom wrote in response to a question about PvE plans. "<em>Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months</em>."</p>
<p>So for now, we can look to sometime in September/October for when the next major batch of content is out for Dune: Awakening. Though, the studio also stipulates <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/comment/myn27y3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">elsewhere in the AMA</a> that while it will always communicate its plans for what's next in the game with the community, it might not necessarily publish a static roadmap.</p>
<p>So far, Dune: Awakening is having an incredibly strong launch, with a new concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">189,333</a> players that was reached this past weekend. It'll be interesting to see how the game continues to grow with the coming updates.</p>
