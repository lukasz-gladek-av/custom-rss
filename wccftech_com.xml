			<p>The new Oblivion Remastered patch released <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-patch-1-2-reduce-stutters/">earlier this week</a> brings some performance improvements over the previous version of the game, but the game is still very far from being in an optimal state, as even hgih-end hardware struggles running the game at high native resolutions without Frame Generation.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by MxBenchmarkPC compares the 1.2 version of the game with the launch version, highlighting how the performance improvements promised in the patch notes are indeed noticeable, but the overall situation is still not optimal. In a GPU-limited scenario on an RTX 5080, with NVIDIA DLSS in quality mode, ultra settings, and no Frame Generation, one of the most powerful GPUs on the market struggles to hit the 60 FPS mark at 4K resolution, and the 70 FPS mark at 1440p resolution, but even in a CPU-limited scenario, performance is far from being optimal, given the hardware. Things don't fare any better at native resolution, as the game runs at barely above 30 FPS at native 4K resolution, and in the 40s FPS range with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode. To hit anything past the 60 FPS mark, Oblivion Remastered needs Frame Generation, which is baffling, considering the GPU the game is running on, but sadly not surprising, considering the remake of the fourth entry in the series is most definitely not the only game powered by Unreal Engine 5 that doesn't run well on PC.</p>

<p>After being rumored to be in the works for a while, Oblivion Remastered was finally revealed and launched this April. Although the shift in atmosphere may be difficult to ignore for some players, and the performance leaves a lot to be desired, the new version of the classic RPG by Bethesda is one worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake is reportedly launching next year, but it may not feature the experience offered by the original in its entirety.</p>



<p>In a recent video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming">Rebs Gaming</a> reported to have talked with two unnamed sources who have connections with Halo series developers. Both have reported that the remake of the first entry in the series will be released to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary next year. The remake, whose development reportedly began in 2023, however, may only feature the single-player campaign, as both sources have heard nothing about multiplayer. Nothing has been said if the yet-to-be-announced remake will also launch on consoles other than Xbox Series X and S, but if it indeed is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unrevealed-new-halo-game-could-launch-on-playstation-5-according-to-new-information/">unrevealed project discovered last month by dataminers</a>, there's the chance it will also mark the series debut on PlayStation 5, much like <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War Reloaded</a> is marking the debut of another of Xbox's tentpole franchises on Sony's console next month.</p>



<p>Besides talking about the Halo Combat Evolved remake, Rebs Gaming also provided an update on Project Ekur, the rebranded battle royale project originally in development as part of Halo Infinite's multiplayer offerings, which was reportedly given to Certain Affinity. While the state of the project is unknown at the moment, known Halo series dataminer grunt.api recently teased some news by posting a new ID code for the game, which was confirmed to be for the project and that is seeing consistent updates in the past few days, indicating that work is continuing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although the Halo Combat Evolved remake has yet to be announced, it will not take long to learn if the project is indeed real, as Halo Studios will reveal what's next for the series at <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">HaloWC 2025</a>, which is taking place in October 2025. Hopefully, we will better understand how the future will shape up for the series that has represented Xbox the most since Microsoft entered the console market after the teased reveals.</p>

			<p>The games industry is undergoing some radical changes, and the challenges it is facing are caused more by the dominance of Fortnite and other popular live service and forever games than subscription services like Xbox Games Pass, according to a well-known analyst.</p>



<p>Commenting on recent video game sales data, Circana (NPD) Executive Director and Video Games Industry Analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Mat Piscatella</a> mentioned how video game subscription spending in the United States reached an all-time high in May 2025 with $0.6 billion spent and achieving the third consecutive month of growth. The analyst speculates that the spending increase in subscription services could be related to inflation and general economic uncertainty, making users look for value, which a service like Xbox Game Pass definitely provides.</p>







<p>Replying to a user mentioning the narrative that subscription services are killing the video games industry, Mat Piscatella highlighted how top live service games like Fortnite are more of a threat to the industry than services like Xbox Game Pass. The top 10 live service games are sucking nearly half of all gaming hours from the PlayStation and Xbox ecosystems before any other game can even get a taste of their popularity, so much so that, in every presentation given, the analyst points out that the biggest competitor to any new game or service is Fortnite. Compared to what the Epic Games' title, Minecraft and Roblox are doing, nothing else really matters.</p>







<p>This isn't the first time this week that we have heard how competing with games like Fortnite will become increasingly difficult. <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-games-industry-is-facing-a-fundamental-realignment-june-2025/">A few days ago</a>, Square Enix's former Director of Business provided a rather in-depth analysis of the gaming industry's current state and how its transition to a social network of games phase is likely to shape its future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Subnautica 2 Leaked Document Allegedly Shows Why KRAFTON Delayed the Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-leaked-document-allegedly-shows-why-krafton-delayed-the-game.1241244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The delay of Subnautica 2 has sparked into somewhat of a controversy between developer Unknown Worlds and parent company KRAFTON. Let's take a minute to recap what happened, chronologically:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game was originally meant to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-is-getting-a-new-game-by-june-2025-says-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by June 2025</a>, but that clearly didn't happen</li>



<li>Earlier this month, KRAFTON <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced</a> the Unknown Worlds studio leadership (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) with industry veteran Steve Papoutsis</li>



<li>This week, Bloomberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that KRAFTON had delayed Subnautica 2 to 2026. They also added that this would cause Unknown Worlds to lose a $250 million bonus linked to reaching a certain amount of revenue by the end of the year.</li>



<li>The delay was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>. However, KRAFTON claimed that it was not at all influenced by financial or contractual considerations.</li>



<li>Shortly afterward, the Korean publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked</a> the former leadership directly, stating that they had abandoned their responsibilities and caused the game to slip. For example, they said Charlie Cleveland focused on a personal film project of his instead of working on the game. </li>



<li>The studio leads would have allegedly received 90% of that $250 million bonus.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, some Reddit user has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an internal KRAFTON document that shows exactly why the publisher didn't want the game to launch. In the current state, Subnautica 2 lacked the 'level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion.' The document also adds that content was removed from the original plan for the early access launch, such as two biomes, one type of Leviathan, certain creatures, several tools, about six hours of narrative content, and even the character customization feature. </p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>Basically, KRAFTON highlighted that the current version of Subnautica 2 wouldn't make users happy, thus the need for the delay to add more content and polish before making the game available to the public.</p>



<p>The former Unknown Worlds executives aren't taking those accusations lying down, though. A few hours ago, Charlie Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Reddit community</a> that he and the other execs are filing a lawsuit against KRAFTON:</p>



<p><em>Weâ€™ve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my lifeâ€™s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</em></p>



<p>Cleveland also denied that the $250 million bonus would have gone almost entirely to them. He said that they had always shared profits with the team and this would not have been different. </p>



<p>Needless to say, KRAFTON is likely to respond in kind to the lawsuit. We'll keep you apprised of any further updates.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-producer-talks-turn-based-combat-viability-final-fantasy-xvi-learnings-and-more.1241223/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy producer, director, and designer Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Anime News Network</a> at last week's Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, California. One of the first questions was about the viability of turn-based combat for future installments in the series. It was Yoshida himself who infamously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that, as the visuals get more realistic, it is increasingly challenging for some gamers to stomach turn-based combat without feeling a dissonance. That's one of the reasons Final Fantasy XVI went with action combat only, angering some fans in the process.</p>



<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which does feature turn-based combat (albeit spiced up with real time elements), did Yoshida change his mind? Not quite, based on his answer, though he did not exclude the possibility that the next Final Fantasy might have turn-based combat.</p>



<p><em>With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system. That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based. I'm not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail.</em></p>



<p>Yoshida was chosen as the producer of Final Fantasy XVI after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-naoki-yoshida-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his excellent work as director of Final Fantasy XIV</a>. What did he learn during the development of the single player game?</p>



<p><em>There's a lot, but if I were to pick one, we were able to learn how to produce a high-end video game. There were a lot of learning points through that, and I feel like we gleaned a lot of know-how through the process. I want to challenge myself or apply to future works on how we can swiftly produce something of high quality and minimize the development period without lowering the quality.</em></p>



<p>Yoshida then said that he and his Final Fantasy XIV already have plans up to version 10.0 (the game is currently at version 7.0 with the Dawntrail expansion). Lastly, he expressed the desire to make a new online game based on a brand-new intellectual property at some point, and he added he doesn't feel anywhere near his retirement (he's currently 52).</p>
