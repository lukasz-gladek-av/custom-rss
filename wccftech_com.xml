			<p>If you were old enough in 2000 to follow video game news, you probably remember an <strong>urban tech legend</strong> regarding <strong><a href="https://gaming-urban-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Iraqi_Super-Computer">Saddam Hussein's attempt to purchase thousands of PlayStation 2 units</a></strong> to link them into a <strong>supercomputer capable of missile guidance</strong>, which supposedly leveraged the console’s <strong>Emotion Engine</strong> chip.</p>



<p>While it was eventually proven that this was just a legend, a recent statement from a lead <strong><em>Final Fantasy IX</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-hopes-reignited/">Chrono Trigger</a></em></strong> developer confirmed that the <strong>Japanese government</strong> of the time was concerned the <strong>Sony</strong> console could indeed be used for <strong>military purposes</strong> due to its unusual power for consumer hardware at the time.</p>



<p><span>Speaking in an interview conducted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61817" target="_blank"><em><strong>Famitsu&nbsp;</strong></em></a>to celebrate the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-website-remake/" target="_blank"><em><strong>25th anniversary</strong></em></a><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>of the ninth entry in the Square Enix series last year, spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-9-lead-says-the-ps2-was-so-so-overpowered-its-cpu-sparked-military-concerns-so-he-struggled-to-get-an-emergency-dev-kit-during-his-stay-in-hawaii-it-was-a-very-difficult-situation/" target="_blank"><em><strong>GamesRadar+</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Kazuhiko Aoki</strong>&nbsp;commented on the development of&nbsp;<em><strong>Final Fantasy IX</strong></em>, which was conducted at a&nbsp;<strong>Square Enix</strong>&nbsp;development studio in&nbsp;<strong>Hawaii</strong>, providing a rather interesting revelation.</span></p>



<p><em>"Come to think of it, towards the end of my time in Hawaii, I was asked to check whether <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">FFIX</strong> would run on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS2</strong> by sending some sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 2</strong> test equipment,"</em> Aoki-san said. <em>"However, at the time, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS2's CPU</strong> was so powerful that there was a possibility that it could be diverted for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">military use</strong>, and so <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">exports were restricted</strong>."</em></p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Saddam Hussein</strong> nor anyone else ever launched a missile with the help of a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 2-based supercomputer</strong>, concerns were grounded, as already mentioned, in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 2’s</strong> unusually high performance for a consumer device of the era. A single <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS2</strong> unit with its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">128-bit SIMD-capable Emotion Engine</strong> was capable of a theoretical <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">6.2 Gigaflops</strong>, considerably more than a high-end <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Intel Pentium III PC,</strong> which was capable of roughly <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1.0 Gigaflop</strong> in comparable workloads.</p>



<p>In addition to its <strong>theoretical max power</strong>, the <strong>PlayStation 2</strong> was made potentially appealing for military applications by its two <strong>Vector Processing Units</strong>, which were well suited to <strong>highly parallel mathematical workloads</strong> such as <strong>trajectory calculations</strong>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, what raised the most concern was the <strong>PlayStation 2's</strong> unusual <strong>price-to-performance ratio</strong>. <strong>Sony</strong> was selling "<strong>supercomputing</strong>" power for just <strong>$299</strong>, a price point achieved by selling the hardware at a loss to recoup costs via game sales. This created a unique loophole where a foreign military could theoretically acquire significant processing power at a very low price.</p>



<p>As <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Aoki-san’s</strong> experience in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Hawaii</strong> illustrates, the idea of consumer consoles attracting military interest was not entirely fanciful. That concept later became reality when the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">US Air Force</strong> built the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://phys.org/news/2010-12-air-playstation-3s-supercomputer.html">Condor Cluster</a></strong> in 2010 using <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1,760 PlayStation 3</strong> consoles.</p>
