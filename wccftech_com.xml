			<p>2K turns 20 this year, and as a way of celebrating 20 years of 2K, some of the most popular titles and franchises will be on sale on Xbox and Steam. If you've been wanting to pick up some of 2K's well-known franchises, now is the perfect time to do so. Additionally, if you want to get even more savings, there is a "20 for 20" bundle, which will have 20 of 2K's digital legacy titles, including Civilization IV, Mafia, Borderlands, and more. If you want to purchase the 20 for 20 bundle, you have until 10 AM PST / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT to purchase it. This bundle is only available on Steam, so you, unfortunately, will not be able to find it on Xbox.</p>
<p>Plus, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-2k-launcher-is-gone-forever-so-you-can-launch-everything-from-steam-and-epic-games-store/">2K Launcher is no more</a>, meaning you won't have to worry about opening another launcher if you are playing your games through Steam, making it a more seamless gaming experience.</p>
<p>For those on PC, the Steam sale starts on February 6 and will end on February 20. For those on Xbox, the sale starts on February 6 and ends on February 17.</p>
