			<p>Yesterday, Skyblivion Project Lead Rebelzize has shared the first fifteen minutes of the fan-made Oblivion remake in Skyrim's engine. This is the iconic tutorial section of the game, where the imprisoned main character accompanies Emperor Uriel Septim in his failed bid to escape from the Mythic Dawn's fated assassination. </p>



<p>The video's narrator notes the improved character models, including textures and hair, compared to the original Oblivion. Moreover, when picking ingredients in Skyblivion, they are visually removed in real time. The modding team has remade every armor, weapon, clothing, and miscellaneous item. The lockpicking mixes the original with some elements from the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online. Sound design has been enhanced, too. Weapons will feel more impactful when hitting foes, and there's new ambient music.</p>



<p>The Skyblivion team even worked hard to make the dungeons fit the region they're supposed to be in. For example, in the tutorial dungeon, players will spot the Imperial Isle above and hear local birds chirping through an opening in the ceiling. The remake's loading screens portray new 'interactive layered art,' while a combination of original and updated tooltips offers players guidance to the game's various systems. Both the birth sign user interface and class selection menu have been remade and look much improved over those in the original Oblivion game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This was just a taste of the remake and more will come soon, but the team is also still seeking volunteer help, especially from those users with experience in nav mesh, quest implementation, and UI design. Still, the 2025 release window (<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank">unveiled initi</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/">ally</a> in early 2023) remains the goal, as the modders prepare for one final push.</p>



<p>In other Elder Scrolls modding news, InfernoPlus has somehow <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-morrowind-running-elden-ring-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to port The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to the Elden Ring engine</a>, though the project is far from done.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-will-launch-at-19-99.1285449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Adelaide-based independent developer Team Cherry has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:njcr3moahtid7crxdjtu26jp/post/3lxqi3epy3s2p?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the launch pricing of Hollow Knight: Silksong: $19.99/€19.99/¥2300. The studio also shared the unlock time with the fans, confirming that the game will be playable starting Thursday, August 4, at 7 AM Pacific Time | 10 AM Eastern Time | 4 PM Central European Time | 11 PM Japan Time.</p>



<p>It must feel almost unreal to Hollow Knight aficionados. It's been eight and a half years since the first game won widespread critical acclaim and became so popular that it has sold over 15 million units over time. Silksong was announced just two years later and was already playable at E3 2019. Still, for a long while, there were no updates from the team, who would later say they preferred to focus all energies on the development instead of communication. </p>



<p>Originally conceived as a DLC for the first installment, Hollow Knight: Silksong has since become much bigger than its predecessor, boasting more enemies, bosses, and 'benches'. It also features a full-fledged quest system and a journal to track those quests. In the narrative, Hornet, the former princess of Hallownest (the region featured in the first game), is captured and brought to the haunted Kingdom of Pharloom, described as a place "haunted by silk and song." She then embarks on a deadly pilgrimage to ascend its peak and discovers ancient secrets tied to her very nature and past.</p>



<p>The game's release date announcement forced several indie games (CloverPit, Aeterna Lucis, Baby Steps, Demonschool, Faeland, Little Witch in the Woods, and the demo of Stomp and the Sword of Miracles) to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay their own launches</a>, as they feared being overshadowed by the long-anticipated sequel. As a reminder, Hollow Knight: Silksong is being released on PC (Windows, macOS, Linux), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Hell is Us is the latest game from Montreal-based studio, Rogue Factor, which has greatly emphasized that this is a game not looking to hold your hand. There are no map markers, no quest trackers, none of the usual open-world comforts modern video game players enjoy.</p>



<p>The game will even remind you of this before it starts, to try and make it land that you're meant to find your way through the game by using your instincts, and paying close attention to your environment. After reviewing it for Wccftech, I can say that Hell is Us does a great job at making that experience feel fun and smooth. I can also say there are a few bits of knowledge that would've been nice to have going into the journey.</p>



<p>That's why this guide will break down the five most important things you'll want to know to be ready to jump into Hell is Us, that also don't ruin the mystery and fun of discovery that's so core to the experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-things-to-know-before-starting-hell-is-us-guide">5 Things to Know Before Starting Hell is Us Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-1-have-a-notebook-and-a-pen-at-the-ready">1. Have a notebook and a pen at the ready</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sometimes it's just easier to write details like this down instead of running back and forth if you can't remember them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You don't need to be writing everything you see and do down, this isn't Blue Prince. But it is helpful to have a notebook beside you with a pen ready to jot down potential clues you come across and parts of a puzzle solution as you try to solve the several puzzles you'll face in Hell is Us. The puzzle gameplay is arguably more important to the game than the combat, and unless you have an incredible memory, or swap back and forth between your game and screenshots you take, you'll need a notebook by your side.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-you-can-t-always-solve-the-puzzle-in-front-of-you-the-first-time-you-see-it">2. You can't always solve the puzzle in front of you the first time you see it</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You won't be able to get into every building and solve every puzzle when you first find them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There will be a few puzzles you come across, one even in the very first area of the game, that you can't solve the first time you see them. You'll need an item or some piece of knowledge that you'll acquire later on in the game, so the only thing to do is to move on and come back to it later.</p>



<p>With Hell is Us lacking any map or quest trackers, it's tough at times to know what will help you progress the main story, what's optional, and what you need to be doing next. All of that packed together means it's easy to spend far too long smashing your head against something you literally cannot solve the first or sometimes even the second time you come across it. Again, another reason why it's good to have a notebook with you, so you can make a note remembering to go back when you have the item or knowledge you're missing.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-spec-into-crowd-control">3. Spec into crowd-control</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Combat encounters are often 3-or-more-against-1. Image credit: Rogue Factor</figcaption></figure>



<p>You have a few different weapon varieties you can choose from, and between those varieties, you can tweak them by infusing abilities based on four core emotions that are central to the game's story. It all comes down to what you prefer to use, because I found that there are things to appreciate with weapon variants for each emotion. But succeeding in the combat is less about the specifics of your gear, and more about how the weapons and abilities you select let you control the flow of combat.</p>



<p>Hell is Us doesn't feature a lot of boss fights; more accurately, it features several combat encounters with a few or sometimes large quantities of enemies that are designed to try and catch you off-balance. That's why whatever weapon you choose, whatever emotional variant you infuse it with, you'll want abilities and a weapon that can help you even out the odds.</p>



<p>A larger weapon, like a greatsword or the halbred-esque polearm are helpful physical tools for crowd control, but area-of-effect abilities that can be added to any of your weapons are going to be more important in helping you keep the advantage in a fight. So even if you go with the shorter-ranged twin axes, as I did for a good chunk of my playthrough, having abilities that stunned and damaged enemies within a certain area of impact helped even out the fact that I could only really focus my blows at one creature at a time, instead of taking wide sweeping attacks against a group.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-talk-to-everyone">4. Talk to everyone</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Details on where to go and what to do next will commonly come up in conversations you have.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This one should be a little more obvious due to how puzzle solving works in Hell is Us, but it needs to be said: talk to every NPC you see. If you can ask them questions, ask them as many questions as you can. Even the six general knowledge topics you'll see appear with every NPC you can have a direct conversation with.</p>



<p>Most of the time, answers pertaining to your investigation and the puzzle you're trying to solve will come through the unique questions you can ask for each NPC. But there are answers to be found when asking the general knowledge questions.</p>



<p>Even beyond just asking to try and help solve a gameplay-related issue you have, it's worth talking to them because Rogue Factor has done a wonderful job in making everyone you meet feel like a real person. Half of the enjoyment there is in Hell is Us comes from the strength of its supporting cast. Spend as much time with them as you can.</p>



<p>Also, you'll have objects you can 'Trade' with NPCs, which is to say there are things you'll find in the world that, if you listen carefully, are items you can deliver to NPCs who have indirectly asked for them. If you're not sure if you've matched the right object to the person, there's no harm in asking, since the wrong person will just tell you they don't need the object or whatever it is you're offering.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-keep-your-head-on-a-swivel">5. Keep your head on a swivel</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You'll always want to be looking at what's on the walls.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hell is Us is not an open-world game. There are several places you'll go to in the game's setting throughout the story, and each is a contained zone that you can explore to the extent of its boundaries.</p>



<p>Because there's no active map for you to rely on, nothing that will tell you in real-time where you've gone and where you're going, you'll need to learn how to get around each zone. Sure, you can make notes and jot directions for yourself, but it's worth keeping in mind that each zone has been designed with the intention that you should be able to find your way naturally.</p>



<p>On top of paying attention to everything people tell you and making notes of the clues you'll read or pick up, looking at the details of your environment is vital to figuring out where to go next and how to solve the puzzles you'll come across. Keep your head on a swivel and don't stop looking around until you're sure you have all the information you need as you move from room to room and place to place within each zone. Since they're all contained, you don't have to worry as much about getting lost and winding up somewhere too far from where you want to be, like how taking the wrong path in an open-world game can mean an hour of backtracking if you're not paying attention.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Hell is Us</h5><p><span>September 4, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>I've been intrigued by the third major release from Montreal-based developer <a href="https://rogue-factor.com/?lang=en">Rogue Factor</a>, Hell is Us, ever since I first saw its debut in 2022. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-is-an-unreal-engine-5-action-adventure-game-due-next-year/">teaser trailer</a> didn't give away much, and frankly, there's a lot about that original trailer that looks very different now, even if I can look back on it and recognize what every element of it refers to now that I've hit credits on it days ahead of its full release. But I've kept the game in the back of my mind for years now, which has its own layer of expectation building, even though I realistically knew very little about the game.</p>



<p>My expectations only rose with its marketing push in the last year, with the first gameplay debut last <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynk7LyKGNHM">September</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-gets-15-minute-extended-gameplay-video/">more detailed look</a> at the puzzle and combat elements in that same month, and again this <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-dungeon-gameplay-trailer/">past July</a>. I purposely avoided the demo to be as devoid of spoilers as possible regarding how the game would actually feel, but I've more or less followed each step of its public development, and in all that time, I've been particularly interested in the studio's emphasis on how Hell is Us has "<em>no hand-holding</em>" for players.</p>



<p>"<em>There's no map, no quest markers, and no hand-holding. Just organic exploration asking you to trust your senses</em>," the game's art and creative director, Jonathan Jacques-Belletête, said in July. The game even reminds you about all of this before it starts.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Hell is Us warns you from the start.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I love that kind of game, challenging me to think outside the box consistently and pay attention to my surroundings more than the map in a menu screen.</p>



<p>And for the most part, I'm glad to say that Hell is Us delivers on that experience in spades. At least until you start to recognize commonalities within its various puzzles, and, as what happened in my case, years of experience with games like Resident Evil and Uncharted kick in to help solve the several puzzles that require you to match symbols with environmental landmarks or figure out the path to odd and uniquely shaped objects that just so happen to fit into a concave spot in the centre of the door you're trying to open.</p>



<p>But even after seeing the patterns, the puzzles are still fun to solve. Paired with a strong combat system, a gameplay and narrative structure that lets you go at your own pace, a thick atmosphere, stunning visuals, and an intriguing lore to the game world that makes me want to read each item description, Hell is Us is, without a doubt, one of 2025's best games.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Acasa Marshes is the second major zone you visit.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's not perfect, though, faltering with its core character, narrative, and the unfortunate reality that faces many modern games, which is the fact that they really didn't need those light RPG elements that seem to have little to no impact on how you progress.</p>



<p>I want to start by talking about its story, Remi, and the fictional country of the game's setting, Hadea. Some basic context for Hell is Us: you play as a man named Remi. Born in Hadea, he was sent away by his mother when he was just five years old, with her final words to him being "<em>I love you. Never come back</em>." Despite growing up in the outside world to be a military man, Remi shows a distinct inability to follow orders and smuggles himself into Hadea years later to find his parents based on a small set of facts he remembers.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You don't have maps or quest markers, but you do have a device that you can check at all times with records of who you've talked to and what you learned from them.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>He was born in Hadea, his family lived in a town called Jova, and his father was the town's blacksmith. He doesn't know if his parents are still alive, but armed with those three facts, he's determined to find them. We begin our journey with Remi after he's officially made it in under the guise of being part of a peacekeeping force trying to do its best to stop the two peoples of Hadea, Sabinians and Palomists, from killing each other off in a brutal civil war.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Remi wears gear he picks up from a mystery person who saved his life.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>But that's not the only element of the game's opening. It more accurately begins with Remi strapped to a chair, with a truth serum currently being administered into his bloodstream. A man who could be a relative of the Baron Vladomir Harkonnen in Villeneuve's Dune sits across from him in a suit, sporting a hat and a bolo tie, and in one of those bits of exposition dialogue that's more for the audience, he tells Remi (us) about Remi. We're told that, according to his file, Remi is a 'high-functioning sociopath,' a cold and calculating man who cares about his own objectives and little else. A man not led by emotions, and honestly, even though it becomes clear that Remi is not without human emotion, I found that, despite Elias Toufexis being behind his voice, Remi is the most boring part of the whole story.</p>



<p>I can understand that Rogue Factor might've intended for players to have a blank sheet in Remi upon which they will write their own emotional journey, but he's not a character I created. He's the central piece of a crafted narrative, and I think it's boring to have your character be emotionless, or for them to at least present a state of emotionlessness. His brooding stare can join the legions of leading characters who are like that to look cool, I suppose? Like I said, he's not actually emotionless, but his range as a character is lacking, and it made it difficult for me to care about him beyond his place within the lore of the game's world. Link has more emotional range without ever saying a word, and in a game absolutely chalk-full of characters you speak to that feel like real people, with real emotions, I found myself stunned by the fact that Remi lacked what I found everywhere else in the game.</p>



<p>Maybe that's another reason why Remi is as boring as he is, because you're supposed to care about everyone else more. You'll talk to Sabinians and Palomists, you'll hear about their traditions, their histories, their cultural views, and perhaps most importantly, you'll hear how they talk about each other.</p>


<figure>

<p>Some Sabinians will tell you the Palomists aren't even people, and that they deserve to have their homes pillaged, destroyed, be sent to work camps, and stay under the Sabinian boot until they die. Some Palomists will tell you, "<em>The only good Sabinian is a dead one</em>," that they are of a lesser stock compared to Palomists, and that they deserve to be treated as such. You'll see graffiti of a group of people having been lynched, which Palomists call "<em>the Sabinian family tree.</em>" Some, from either side, will express disgust at the hatred, the fighting, and the atrocities committed. They'll argue they're all Hadeans first, and beyond that, they are all human. The atmosphere built by what you see and hear in the environmental storytelling weighed on me constantly, with signs of hate and violence that remind me too much of real-world news and the worst examples of what people are capable of.</p>



<p>Both will argue an original claim to Hadea, with the Palomists' argument generally carrying more religious reasons than the ones given by the Sabinians. And again, there are a select few on both sides who believe the two can coexist peacefully and that this fighting has to come to an end.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Palomists and Sabinians call anyone not born in Hadea 'an outsider.'</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Children are the future.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Almost everyone you talk to will give you an opinion on the same six topics.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>
<div>

</div>
</figure>



<p>It was impossible for me to hear all of this and not think of the ongoing genocide in Gaza, particularly due to how the fighting between the Sabinians and the Palomists is depicted between its historical and religious origins. I'm not saying that Rogue Factor mapped the conflict between Sabinians and Palomists based on the generations of fighting between Palestinians and Israelis, or that Sabinians were mapped to Palestinians and Palomists to Israelis or vice-versa. In fact, key differences in how the situation in Hadea is depicted seem to avoid those one-to-one comparisons purposefully. The studio's technical designer, Simon Girard, even discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/history-is-repeating-itself-the-real-world-inspirations-of-hell-is-us-are-as-relevant-today-as-they-were-30-years-ago">in an interview</a> that went live days before this review, how Hadea is meant to represent no singular conflict, just the reality of civil wars in a brutal way. "<em>The nature is of neighbours-against-neighbours. It's not one country against another. It's people who are the same, right? They're divided amongst either geographical or cultural or religious lines, but they're one in the same</em>."</p>



<p>Even still, the comparisons between what's presented in Hell is Us and our current world were impossible to ignore, particularly when some of the characters laid blame at the lens through which the media reported on issues between the two peoples, and how the role of the media in causing and perpetuating the civil war is discussed.</p>



<p>Rogue Factor front-loads all of this and the importance of the ongoing civil war in Hadea and the divide between Sabinians and Palomists, with your introduction to the town of Jova being a Sabinian-occupied town with a few Palomists trying to stay hidden, held in captivity, or, as is the case for the man who upgrades your weapons, not held captive by ropes and chains, but by being put to work for the occupying force. The rest of the town was either taken to the forest to be shot or sent to work camps.</p>



<p>It's a violent, terrifying introduction to Hadea, with dark displays of hatred in every house you walk into, some of which feature displays of sexual violence that are particularly dark.</p>


<figure>

<p>Almost everywhere you go in the game is like this. One area is spared, with its design being that of a warm blanket and all the comfort it can provide. It's a safe haven from the fighting, where you can see NPCs end up by making certain narrative choices, but the rest of the game's locations don't let up.</p>



<p>To say that it's a lot to kick things off is an understatement, so I found it disappointing that it all took a backseat in the narrative to focus on the more fictional elements. The history of Hadea and the fighting between Sabinians and Palomists are all woven through the lore, but Remi's personal quest drives the bus for the story. It was a heavy narrative opening with no real payoff, and ultimately landed on 'War is bad, humans are capable of awful things.' That's a fine message, but it felt lacking when compared to the opening and what follows with every other city you go to in Hadea, and the complexities of the characters you meet.</p>



<p>The game even has an added layer to the narrative with examples of the creatures you fight being less monstrous than the people of Hadea, but it's once again not leaned on enough.</p>

<p>There was also a core element of the gameplay that I found a tad narratively incongruent with the positive side of any message its narrative has, which is centered around helping people who need help. You can return to a key NPC to receive a reward every time you complete a side quest that's called a 'Good Deed.' You'll get a gameplay-focused reward when you do so, and getting a reward each time feels like it misses the point of doing the good deed in the first place.</p>



<p>This is all to say that Hell is Us gets a lot of things right with its narrative. The lore of the creatures and the history Rogue Factor has built is really interesting, and I have a lot of time for a game that tells its story through environmental design and item descriptions more than it does cutscenes. But it doesn't stick the landing, and doesn't go as deep as I expected it to based on its heavy opening.</p>



<p>The gameplay, on the other hand, is actually pretty much the same, just on a different scale. It's good, sometimes really good, sometimes great, but it doesn't succeed in crossing the line to amazing. The combat is fairly solid. I really appreciate a key mechanic that lets you get your health back by being aggressive. But, at least when playing on its normal, balanced difficulty setting, it was never challenging enough that I had to really engage with the various buffs and slight build changes you can make with passive and active abilities and special attacks.</p>

<p>Once you find what works between your weapon choice, abilities, and drone attacks, sticking with it is all you need to do, and you can practically ignore everything else that's not just 'upgrade your weapon to hit harder' afterwards. I found a passive relic that, when equipped, made it so that I did 200% damage to enemies after a successful parry. Paired with a halbred-esque weapon called a Polearm, I got through every combat encounter with little trouble. There are a few cool-looking killing blows you can deliver, though. I also appreciated that even though there were only a few variations of the creatures you fight, later-stage versions of them get new attacks to switch things up.</p>



<p>The best part about playing Hell is Us, though, is its puzzles, partly because the whole world is a puzzle, as you're constantly trying to put context clues together to figure out where to go next. Sometimes you solve that problem by talking to people, sometimes by looking at your surroundings, and sometimes the answers come through objects you find. Like I said before, you start to notice the pattern to it, but that doesn't make it any less fun.</p>

<p>The puzzles kept me glued to Hell is Us. Walking around one of the major dungeons, exploring each new zone for clues about the story or where I'm supposed to be going. It's where I had the most fun, and the design that went into every puzzle, particularly in making each zone and the world you explore a giant puzzle, is why I truly think, despite my problems with its narrative, Hell is Us will remain as one of 2025's best games.</p>



<p>I can only fault it so much for falling short of its introduction, and I was absolutely glued to it throughout my playthrough. It only took me 26 hours to hit credits, but you can easily spend double that time looking into every nook and cranny, and I intend to keep digging further.</p>



<p>There's no question that Rogue Factor has made a great game. Hell is Us is an amazing accomplishment for the studio, and especially for a core team of 55 developers. It fumbles in places, but I was so engrossed with all the things it does well that those fumbles don't overshadow the whole experience.</p>

<p>Hell is Us might not go as far as I want it to in more ways than one, but it doesn't entirely drop the ball either. Overall, it delivers a package to be missed for anyone looking for a deep narrative and a solid action game, with a lot of puzzles and a rich atmosphere tying it all together.</p>

				<p>Hell is Us is an amazing accomplishment, and will easily remain one of 2025's best games, though it falls short of amazing, and reaching the status of some of its influences.

			<p>A <a href="https://streamable.com/ydlo9l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked footage</a> shared earlier today on the popular Chinese online video sharing website Bilibili provides the first look at the Battle Royale map that Battlefield 6 players will eventually find in the game.</p>



<p>It was early 2024 when we first <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-to-launch-in-october-2025-with-f2p-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> on a rumor that the new Battlefield installment would include a Battle Royale mode. That rumor, from renowned leaker Tom Henderson, correctly predicted the game's October 2025 launch date and also guessed that the mode would be available at launch. However, since then, it's become obvious that this would not be the case. First, there was a report from <a href="https://twitter.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1948529831911821481?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content creator rivalXfactor</a>, and then, more importantly, EA did not make any mention of Battle Royale modes when describing the modes that will be there when Battlefield 6 is released. </p>



<p>On the other hand, dataminers <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-nvidia-dlss-4-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found mention of the mode in the game files</a> over two months ago, and the Battlefield Labs account recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1950993144205680912?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a Battle Royale mode that would be coming to the testing program soon. It looks like the mode has finally been made available to testers, leading to the leaked video mentioned above. The obvious conclusion is that BR will be introduced to Battlefield 6 at some point after launch; perhaps the developers wanted to focus on the core modes first while they ironed out Battle Royale, which is obviously very different from all the other modes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A free-to-play BR mode is going to be critical to even attempt to reach the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lofty 100 million players target shared internally by publisher Electronic Arts</a>. As much as long-time fans of the franchise loved the Battlefield 6 beta, it was still very much a classic, albeit refined, Battlefield experience, and there aren't anywhere near 100 million BF aficionados out there. It will take a very solid Battle Royale mode to pull at least part of that audience away from the likes of Apex Legends, Call of Duty Warzone, Fortnite, et cetera.</p>



<p>In other Battlefield 6 news, the developers have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that ray tracing has been left out of the game in order to focus on performance instead.</p>

			<p>As any PC gamer who played some Battlefield 6 during the recent beta test weekends will have already noticed, there is no trace of ray tracing options whatsoever in the graphics settings. That, alongside the complete absence of any mention from the developers, was already more than telling. However, just to be absolutely certain, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-bf6-no-ray-tracing-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comicbook.com</a> got the chance to ask Christian Buhl, who is the Studio Technical Director at Ripple Effect (formerly known as DICE LA, the team working primarily on the Portal mode). Buhl confirmed that ray tracing was not considered and is probably not making it into the game in the near future, either.</p>



<p><em>No, we are not going to have ray-tracing when the game launches and we don’t have any plans in the near future for it either. That was because we wanted to focus on performance. We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as optimized as possible for the default settings and the default users. So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we just weren’t going to do ray-tracing and again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else.</em></p>



<p>Needless to say, it does feel a bit of a downgrade when you consider that Battlefield V was one of the first PC games to support ray tracing back in 2018, specifically for the reflections. Three years later, the ill-fated Battlefield 2042 offered ray traced ambient occlusion. However, Buhl is definitely right that a competitive multiplayer shooter should focus first and foremost on performance.</p>



<p>Players have clearly appreciated that, turning the Battlefield 6 beta into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest ever registered for this franchise</a>. GeForce users can <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further accelerate performance</a> with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. AMD users can enable FSR 3 with FSR Frame Generation, and Intel users can select Intel XeSS with XeSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10.</p>
