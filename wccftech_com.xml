			<p>After a few years of quiet, French developer Midgar Studio has announced Edge of Memories, a sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/edge-of-eternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edge of Eternity</a>. However, while that game was a traditional JRPG, this one will be a full-fledged action RPG with real time combat, although still inspired by Japanese games in terms of art style and animation. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it will be published by Nacon, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-eternity-developer-midgar-studio-acquired-by-nacon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> the studio in 2022.</p>
<p>This time, the game takes place on the other side of the world of Heryon, on the continent of Avaris, where the nomadic inhabitants are also now battling the Corrosion plague. The protagonist is Eline, an itinerant Soul Whisperer who fights relentlessly against this force that is turning the once-thriving flora, fauna, and people of this lush land into grotesque abominations. After a mysterious encounter, a dark power awakens within her that may hold the key to ending this apocalypse: the ability to control the corrosion within her own body. She won't be alone in her journey, thanks to the presence of her mentor Ysoris and Kanta, the shaman prince of a lost tribe.</p>
<p>Edge of Memories features a combo-based combat system where players will have to alternate quick strikes and devastating techniques to be more efficient. Customizing companions and using their abilities in the most appropriate way will also be crucial to success. Lastly, Eline can transform into a berserker to deliver powerful blows and executions.</p>
<p>The continent of Avaris features various vibrant biomes, including the idyllic sandy shores of the port city of Sarlah-Durah and the snow-capped peaks of the Kezal Mountains. Players will traverse them with the help of a Nekaroo, a rideable and agile feline companion that helps the player reach otherwise inaccessible areas.&nbsp;According to the developers, as the story moves forward, the game transforms the places the player has traveled before, creating strange new paths for them to take. Midgar Studio also promises that there won't be any filler quests, each mission adding depth to either the story, the characters, or the relationships between them.</p>

<p>Lastly, there's good news on the soundtrack front, too. CÃ©dric Menendez is taking care of it, and the final theme features the voice of Emi Evans, known for her work on NieR: Automata, and the work of Yasunori Mitsuda, known for his work on games such as Chrono Trigger, Xenoblade Chronicles, and Sea of Stars. Edge of Memories is slated to launch in Q4 2025 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738170/Edge_of_Memories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>Pathologic 3: Quarantine is a free prologue for <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathologic 3</a>, and it will be released in just a few weeks, as revealed yesterday by developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher Hype Train Digital. It's been described as a story-driven adventure about a young scientist, Daniil Dankovsky, and his quest for immortality and a mysterious plague outbreak in a small town.&nbsp;Players will learn how the scientist's story began and what drove him to leave his acclaimed lab. They'll examine patients, uncover strange secrets, and take their first steps toward defeating death.</p>
<p>The developers have prepared a significant narrative twist: the narrative is told through unreliable narrators, including Dankovsky's subjective lens and the lens of his persecutors. The story is also said to be non-chronological. That is to say, it will be told out of order.</p>
<p>As a doctor, Dankovsky will try to fight the Sand Plague by examining and diagnosing patients, but also by investigating their lives to find out the unpleasant truths they may be hiding. He can also issue decrees based on new findings to save more lives. Moreover, Dankovsky has a sharp mind, and everything he sees can tell a story and become part of his mental map of the world, encouraging Pathologic 3: Quarantine players to pay attention to everything in the environment.</p>
