			<p>Today, Crosswind Crew has announced that its eponymous debut game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crosswind-is-an-upcoming-f2p-pirate-survival-mmo-in-development-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Crosswind</a>, will debut at some point next year <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041230/Crosswind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. The studio also revealed a shift from the previous plan to deliver a free-to-play survival MMO to a more traditional premium survival game. Following the recent Alpha test, the developers surveyed players' preferences and behaviors and reached this conclusion.</p>



<p>New content, features, and gameplay will be added based on player feedback, such as the new biome and crew improvements shown in the summer teaser below. Crosswind Crew is also exploring new options available thanks to the transition to a paid experience, like the potential for mods and dedicated servers.</p>

<p>Crosswind is a survival game set in an alternative Age of Piracy. Featuring the classic "build, craft, survive" formula, it offers challenging boss fights, sea battles, boarding actions, and seamless ship-to-land gameplay. Driven by real-world characters and supernatural powers, the story unfolds as an epic fight against an ancient evil.</p>



<p>Players assume the role of a freelance captain who has been betrayed and stranded after a job gone wrong. What starts as a grounded story of survival and revenge quickly puts them in a conflict between empires, pirate clans, and mysterious dark powers looming on the horizon.</p>



<p>Crosswind lets players seamlessly continue their adventure from sea to land and vice versa: bombard coastal forts from afar, then close in and engage the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Many different ships are available, from nimble cutters to frigates and even massive galleons.</p>



<p>Crosswind aims to be a refined and comprehensive survival experience at its core. Players will explore the game world's biomes to gather resources and then unleash their creativity through building and crafting. At first, they might build a shelter, which can eventually turn into a fully operational outpost. It is also possible to recruit and expand the crew to speed up harvesting and production.</p>



<p>In combat, a vast arsenal of melee weapons and firearms will be at the player's disposal. Movesets include parrying and dodging enemy attacks while using different strikes to the player's advantage, as well as managing food, potions, and oils to gain powerful buffs. Players will also find challenging bosses and defeating them will provide access to their juicy treasures. Of course, when in trouble, they might call on the aid of their friends via the co-op feature.</p>

			<p>Publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-publisher-annapurna-interactive-entire-team-has-reportedly-resigned/">Annapurna Interactive</a> has announced the release date for LEGO Voyagers, a co-op game developed by the studio behind <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1544360/LEGO_Builders_Journey/">LEGO Builder's Journey</a>, Light Brick. Imagine what It Takes Two might look like if it starred two tiny LEGO bricks instead, and you're on the path to picturing LEGO Voyagers. First revealed during this year's<a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/"> Summer Game Fest</a> showcase, it'll arrive on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC this coming September 15, 2025.</p>



<p>The news of the release date was revealed with a new trailer, showing off a bit more gameplay to add to what we saw back in June. LEGO Voyagers is a two-player co-op game, where a small orange and blue brick attach to and form a myriad of shapes with the LEGO environment around them to overcome platforming obstacles, solve puzzles, and embark on a picturesque adventure, brick by brick.</p>

<p>It's an entirely non-verbal narrative, as the two colored bricks will just make expressive noises throughout the whole journey to communicate, and you'll have to solve all the game's challenges by figuring out what you can build to keep moving. </p>



<p>There doesn't seem to be any elaborate narrative embedded in LEGO Voyagers, with the journey being more about the themes it touches on. A press release for the game details that the adventure begins with the two bricks deciding to "<em>rescue an abandoned spaceship</em>," and along the way they discover "<em>the value of being connected</em>."</p>



<p>It all together seems like a charming game that will be up for Best Family Game at the end of the year for The Game Awards, and it might even have a few noteworthy puzzle and gameplay challenges for LEGO fans to dig into. We'll see what the whole adventure has in store on September 15, 2025.</p>
