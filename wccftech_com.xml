			<p>Amazon's God of War TV series is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">set to start filming in March 2026</a> after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/">show was rebooted with Ronald D. Moore</a> now at the helm as showrunner. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/">Deadline</a> reveals that Amazon has ordered two seasons of the show, and that the first two episodes of season one will be directed by Emmy award-winning director Frederick E.O. Toye of Shogun and The Boys.</p>



<p>Moore is still leading the charge on the show as its showrunner, writer, and executive producer, but Toye will take the directing reins for the first two episodes, the two episodes that, arguably more than the ones that will follow, will set the tone for the series.</p>



<p>Deadline's report also adds that, ahead of filming in March, the show has already started pre-production in Vancouver. It's currently unclear what elements of the God of War series the show will pull from, though we know that the show will pull from God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok, rather than the original Greek mythology-focused God of War games.</p>



<p>Casting for Kratos and Atreus is currently underway, as the big question around the show is who will be chosen to fill those iconic roles. Christopher Judge, who plays Kratos in the new rebooted version of God of War, has previously talked about throwing his hat in the ring, but also adds that he has no animosity towards whoever gets the role. </p>

			<p>At the time of this writing, The Game Awards is only ten days away, which means that we're getting close to the end of 2025 and that we're potentially days away from seeing the biggest reveals for the video game industry in 2025. The nominees for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">almost every category were already announced</a>, save for the only category that is decided entirely by public vote: the Player's Voice Award.</p>



<p>The Player's Choice Award is decided over three rounds of voting, and the first round <a href="https://thegameawards.com/brackets/players-voice">was pushed live to The Game Awards website today</a> for players to check out and vote on. It starts with 30 games, of which players can pick their favourite 10 to potentially move into the next round.</p>



<p>You can head to the website to select your preferred 10 now, and it's recommended that you do so sooner than later if you want your vote to count in each round, since the voting for round one will end as of Tuesday, December 2, at 6pm PT / 9pm ET. </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, all six games nominated for Game of the Year made the cut for the Players' Voice. In fact, most of the 30 games are nominated in at least one other category for this year's Game Awards. There are, however, a couple of games that aren't nominated anywhere else save for Players' Voice, including Delta Force, Genshin Impact, Warframe, and REPO.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Remnant II Publisher Arc Games Now Independent After Splitting from Embracer Group]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-publisher-arc-games-now-independent-after-splitting-from-embracer-group/</link>
            <guid>1369636</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Embracer Group <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/">shed two more companies it had scooped up during its acquisition spree</a> that led to a major collapse when <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/">a massive $2 billion deal fell through</a>, and the company was unable to recover. This time, it was Remnant II publisher Arc Games and developer Cryptic Studios who were able to escape Embracer Group before the company shut them down, as it did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/">Volition Games</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/timesplitters-fans-have-their-hopes-crushed-once-again-by-new-closure-of-developer-free-radical-design/">Free Radical Design</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Arc Games is the newest independent publisher of double-A games on the block, thanks to a successful buyout from Embracer with the help of XD Inc., which provided financing support to make the buyout possible.</p>



<p>The publisher's current organizational structure will remain the same during the transition, and the company will not be laying off any members of its team. It's the ideal scenario where Arc Games doesn't collapse under a larger parent company that made some pretty callous decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>This milestone marks a major new chapter for Arc Games</em>," said chief executive officer Yoon Im, in a press release. "<em>We appreciate our time being a part of Embracer Group and the accomplishments achieved since the company's inception over 15 years ago. These</em> <em>experiences have shaped who we are today. As an independent publisher,</em> <em>we are now positioned to more fully pursue our vision - collaborating with exceptional developers worldwide and bringing standout games to market. 2026 is already shaping up to be one of the most ambitious and innovative years in our history, and we are excited for what lies ahead</em>."</p>



<p>Along with publishing both Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant II, Arc Games is also known for publishing the Torchlight series, Star Trek Online, Neverwinter, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-gets-slight-delay-early-access-debut-avoid-battlefield-6/">recently released Fellowship</a>. It has also published titles like Have A Nice Death and Hyper Light Breaker.</p>
