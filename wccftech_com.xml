			<p>Plenty of studios make horror videogames, but fewer are dedicated to only making horror games in the way that Bloober Team is. They've had a few stumbles along the way, but are clearly finding their stride after its stunning Silent Hill 2 Remake, and what appears to be another success with the coming Cronos: The New Dawn, which is also heading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-september-5/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> alongside other current-gen consoles and PC.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">The Game Business</a>, Bloober Team's chief executive officer Piotr Babieno indicates that it was no mistake that the studio made the effort to put Cronos, its latest horror adventure, on the Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the fact that it gets the game in front of players who might not have the option to grab Cronos: The New Dawn on other platforms, Babieno grew up a Nintendo fan, and wants to bring back an era where Nintendo was known for more than just the place to get child and family-friendly games.</p>



<p>"<em>I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true</em>. <em>I am a huge Nintendo fan. I grew up with Nintendo consoles. The most important horrors, like Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 4… were available on Nintendo GameCube. It was a gold time for Nintendo fans. In some ways, we would like to be the one to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now</em>," Babieno said. </p>



<p>"<em>We have some plans. We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team.</em>"</p>



<p>The Switch platform is not entirely devoid of horror games. Alien: Isolation is arguably one of the best horror games in the past two decades, and there's an excellent port of it available on the Switch. That said, the Switch isn't exactly brimming with horror games. Horror doesn't even come up as a genre filter when <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/games/#games-by-genre">browsing for games on the eShop</a>.</p>



<p>Babieno has a long way to achieve his personal dream, but it doesn't sound like he'll be giving up anytime soon. He's even looking to the Japanese company for inspiration on how to keep Bloober Team together through the tough times the video game industry is currently experiencing. </p>



<p>"<em>We didn’t cut any staff at Bloober Team for the last few years</em>.  <em>This is really important because I believe that if we have teams that are making great games and understand our DNA, it's much easier to create new projects. And I think that this is another parallel with Nintendo, because [it has] a similar spirit of how we are trying to do things.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It isn’t our goal to be the biggest player on the Polish stock exchange</em>," he added. "<em>Our goal is to be the best horror game developer.</em>"</p>

			<p>Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have announced the Year 2 roadmap for Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, which will include the addition of a new playable class, new game modes, new operations, and more.</p>



<p>A trailer debuted today goes over everything to expect for the second year of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 updates, that'll kick off next week on September 4, 2025, which is days ahead of the one-year anniversary of Space Marine 2's launch.</p>

<p>The new additions to gameplay, including the new modes, the new playable class, the Techmarine, and the new operations, additional weapons, enemies, and bosses, will all be added as part of free updates that will arrive throughout Saber's Year 2 plans for Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>There will also be a bevy of additional paid cosmetic content that will be delivered through the season pass for year 2, but of course cosmetics are always an optional bonus. You won't be missing out on any additional playable content if you skip out on the season pass. </p>

<p>This past June, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment celebrated Space Marine 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/">surpassing 7 million copies sold</a> in the game's first year, and while it's clear from this roadmap that Saber is still hard at work on keeping Space Marine 2 updated, the studio has already confirmed that work has begun on<a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/"> Space Marine 3</a>.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Wccftech reviewed Space Marine 2 last year</a>, we enjoyed it, even if the gameplay fell into a rut after some time with it. "<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a decent game, but one that becomes repetitive quite quickly, though fans of this sort of action combat could find it enjoyable.</em>"</p>

			<p>Even though the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over, you can still get the chance to play it again ahead of its launch on October 10, 2025. Alongside a new trailer for the PC version of Battlefield 6 that debuted today, EA and Battlefield Studios also resumed sign-ups for its Battlefield Labs playtesting program, where new maps, gameplay modes, and adjustments from the beta will be tested ahead of launch.</p>



<p>The trailer is a feature highlight reel of the experience PC players will be able to have, so long as they have the hardware for it, of course. With ultrawide monitor support, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/">NVIDIA DLSS multi-frame generation support</a>, along with support for Intel XeSS and AMD FSR, and boasting 600+ customization options for PC. If you played the beta on your PC, then you're probably already aware of this. You're also probably aware of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">secure boot issue</a> that plagued many players just trying to get into Battlefield 6, which, in its own way, gets a mention in the trailer as it highlights the game's Javelin Anti-Cheat protection.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>What's more exciting is the fact that there's still a chance to play more Battlefield 6 before its launch, with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing">Battlefield Labs sign-ups resuming again</a>. If you weren't already in the playtesting program, you're getting another shot, with the collective Battlefield Studios looking to test all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">changes previously discussed based on feedback from the beta</a>, along with new functionality for Battlefield Portal and server browsing.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs playtesters will also get to try out new maps like Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley, and be able to test out Hardcore Mode for the first time.</p>



<p>If you loved the beta and are dying to play more Battlefield 6, then the Labs playtesting program is your best bet to jump in as soon as you can. Beyond that, you'll have to wait until it launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025, to jump back in the fight.</p>
