			<p>It looks like Microsoft's big decision to switch to a multiplatform policy could start paying dividends soon if the PlayStation Store pre-order charts are to be believed. As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-topping-the-pre-order-charts-on-the-playstation-store-with-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-forza-horizon-5.1144932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra user Red Kong XIX, two games that are due to launch in April, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5, are taking the top spots across various countries with their various editions.</p>
<p><em><strong>United States</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #14</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Canada</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>

<p><em><strong>United Kingdom</strong></em></p>

<p>It seems like PlayStation users are eager to get their hands on two of the best Microsoft games released in the past few years. Forza Horizon 5 might be the most surprising since it's now nearly four years old. Still, it's arguably the finest open world racing game ever made, having won several Game of the Year awards in 2021. Here on Wccftech, the game earned a 9.5/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Wray's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Let's keep it simple. Forza Horizon 5 is a fantastic game. It's outstanding, and I can unashamedly say that if it's not my favorite, it's in my top five games of the year. I recommend it for anybody and everybody.</em></p>
<p>When the game launches on PS5 on April 29, all users in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40-million-strong community</a> will be able to access the new Horizon Realms update that allows drivers to relive the post-launch Evolving World updates at their leisure.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will debut twelve days earlier despite being much more recent. Still, it's just every bit as great as Forza Horizon 5 in its own genre, as I outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my 9/10 review of the PC version</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>It is perhaps a bit ironic that both games will be played best on consoles on Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro, but that's entirely on Microsoft for choosing not to make another mid-generation console refresh like they did with the Xbox One X.</p>
<p>Anyway, as The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-more-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a>, this is just the beginning for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch users. Microsoft-owned studios are expected to release many more titles on 'rival' consoles throughout the year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly Bethesda's Starfield</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian's Avowed</a>, and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%93-how-to-change-seasons.1145013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-change-seasons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows enhances the open-world formula seen in previous entries in the series by introducing some dynamic elements that make the world feel more alive than ever. Some of these elements also have a considerable impact on the gameplay, such as Seasons. Depending on the current one, Naoe and Yasuke will have to deal with different weather and environmental conditions that can make certain quests easier or harder to complete. Other mechanics, such as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/"> Scouts mechanics</a>, are also tied to the cycle of Seasons, so knowing how they change is extremely important to take full advantage of all the mechanics tied to them.</p>
<p>The changing of Seasons in Assassin's Creed Shadows depends on the<strong> actual passage of time</strong>. <strong>Spring, Summer and Autumn last 140 minutes</strong>, while <strong>Winter 180 minutes</strong>. No matter which activity you complete in the game, <strong>there's no way to speed up the changing of Seasons</strong>, altough there are ways to prevent a Season from changing automatically, or initiate a change manually when the time is up.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250326114317_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To learn when a Season will end, all you need to do is open the main menu and access the World tab. In the upper right corner of the map, you will find<strong> a compass</strong> with a circulation progression bar. Once it is filled with the passage of time, <strong>the Season will change if you either fast travel, complete a mission or hold the right directional button while in the World menu</strong>. The same will happen if you do any of the things above when the progression bar is halfway full. In this case, you will trigger a mid-season refresh that won't change the Season, but will refresh locations, local factions and alerts.</p>
<p>Even if the Season has ended, if you do not fast travel, complete a mission or trigger the change manually via the main menu, <strong>it will not change</strong>, so you can use this to your advantage. During Spring, for example, you will find additional vegetation all over the world, which you can use to better conceal yourself if needed. During Fall, to make another example, weather will change more often, and you can use a heavy downpour at night to have an easier time sneaking inside enemy strongholds or camps. Being able to change the Season at wish might have been better for some, but this new Assassin's Creed Shadows system, if used correctly, can still be a strong tool to help Naoe and Yasuke in their quest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunning reveal trailer</a> for The Witcher IV at The Game Awards 2024, fans might have hoped to see the game in the not-too-distant future. However, CD Projekt RED has now confirmed that there's still a long wait ahead.</p>
<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4?t=1175s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscal year 2024 earnings conference</a>, they announced that the game won't be launched until at least 2027. Here's the full quote:</p>
<p><em>Regarding the expected release date for The Witcher IV, we are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet. All we could share for now to give more visibility to investors is that the game will not be launched within the timeframe of the first target for the incentive program, which ends on 31 December 2026.</em></p>
<p>It isn't inconceivable, then, that the two most anticipated fantasy open world roleplaying games, The Elder Scrolls VI and The Witcher IV, might be launched in the same year or at least in relative proximity. Bethesda's game might also debut in late 2027, given that Starfield <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in September 2023</a>, and there is usually a four-year timeframe between their titles.</p>
<p>Following the aforementioned reveal of The Witcher IV, the Polish studio provided some info on the first installment in the new saga:</p>
<ul>
<li>As most fans had surmised following the end of the previous chapter, Cirilla Fiona Riannon will be the protagonist. The previous actress (Jo Wyatt) has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by Ciara Berkeley. Having Ciri leading the game also allows the development team to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase player agency</a> since she's just starting her journey as a Witcher, as opposed to Geralt, who had a lot of experience on the job.</li>
<li>There will be 'super compelling, very meaningful' <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-has-super-compelling-very-meaningful-romances-in-store-for-ciri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">romances</a> in store for her throughout the game.</li>
<li>Gwent <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in the game</a>.</li>
<li>The Witcher IV will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-will-be-around-the-same-size-of-wild-hunt-devs-aim-for-quality-over-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around the same size as The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</a>, although the team aims for quality rather than quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the financial report, CD Projekt RED revealed that 2024 was a solid year despite the lack of new releases. The studio almost reached $260 million in revenue, and the net profit line was the third-best in the group's history. CD Projekt RED also announced that it will soon become the owner of 100% of shares of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Molasses Flood</a>, the Boston-based developer that's working on The Witcher spin-off called Project Sirius. As you might remember, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> a couple of years ago. Following the total control of the shares, The Molasses Flood will be fully merged into CD Projekt RED.</p>
