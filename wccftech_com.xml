			<p>Bill Roper, a Blizzard veteran who worked on the first games in the Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo franchises in various capacities (producer, design, voice-over, etc.), has announced that his studio has secured funding for Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>The studio, Lunacy Games, was actually supposed to produce <a href="https://wccftech.com/hellgate-redemption-ue5-sequel-hellgate-london-details-sketchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellgate: Redemption</a>, a sequel to Hellgate: London, a cult classic Diablo-like game that Roper created after departing from Blizzard, and a game called Skinwalkers, which would merge the Weird West and Cthulhu settings, with players acting as cowboys. However, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/bill-robers-lunacy-games-raises-500k-from-accelerator-for-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to GamesBeat</a>, Roper said the studio couldn't find anyone who would fund this project, which required between $15 million and $20 million. </p>



<p>They did find someone to fund Innsmouth Mysteries, though. <a href="https://www.bbx.games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Bang Accelerator</a> agreed to provide $500K for the project, which is a cooperative horror extraction roleplaying game inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. In a mysterious 1920s seaside town, a team of player-controlled supernatural investigators must uncover the truth, collect arcane artifacts, and stop an ancient evil from being unleashed before midnight strikes.</p>



<p>Ying Sha, co-founder of BBX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Lunacy Games has a clear and compelling vision for a Co-op Horror Extraction RPG, and it's backed by a team of veterans whose track record speaks for itself. We are proud to support studios like theirs that are pushing the boundaries of games. We see Innsmouth Mysteries as a project that perfectly aligns with our mission to support talented teams to bring high-quality, deeply engaging experiences to players.</em></p>



<p>For his part, Roper believes there's a significant middle ground between triple-A and indie games that is currently underserved, a place where exciting gameplay mixes with deep, immersive, and story-rich experiences, which the studio aims to deliver with Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>Lunacy Games currently has just 13 employees, and Roper himself contributes to the audio work as well. There's no release window yet, but we'll keep track of the progress.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's game director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has been clear about a few things in 2025: that <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">development on Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is "<em>coming along really well</em>,"</a> and that Clair Obsucr: Expedition 33 is an excellent game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-goty-votes-phil-spencer-naoki-hamaguchi/">It's his pick for Game of the Year</a>, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-would-love-to-make-a-aa-game-with-a-similar-scope-to-clair-obscur-expedition-33-thats-really-focused-on-one-area/">GamesRadar</a>, he's gone a step further to say that he "<em>would love</em>" to make a game at the scope and scale of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>The comment came up when Hamaguchi was discussing how with triple-A development, there's so much that goes into a game at that scale. "<em>Whatever direction you look at it, whatever element you take, it's a very high quality</em>."</p>



<p>Smaller, double-A games, however, can be more focused in Hamaguchi's view. They have the ability to "<em>pick one aspect of one element and really push that and...take that to a high level</em>."</p>



<p>It's within that vein that Hamaguchi said that he "<em>would love to try and make a game like that [AA], which is really focused on one area, pushing the boat out, and making that one aspect as fun as possible</em>."</p>



<p>Though he's also clear that this isn't exactly realistic with his current role at Square Enix. Fulfilling his desire to make this smaller-scoped game would only work if he "<em>completely ignored the reality of it - the position I have in the company, what they want me to make, the requirements of my position and that kind of thing</em>."</p>



<p>While Hamaguchi is right, that the idea of him spending his time making a much smaller scoped game within Square Enix is not feasible when you account for all the responsibilities he has and the amount of money Square puts into its games, it would be really interesting to see what he and his teammates at Square Enix could come up with if they were given free reign to make a much more focused, double-A style game. </p>

			<p>Just Cause creator Cristofer Sundberg left Avalanche Studios, which he had co-founded, in late 2020 to create his own company, Liquid Swords. The studio is working on a GTA-like open world game that was first shown to the world last year. Recently, it has shared around ten seconds of new in-game footage to keep players intrigued about the untitled project.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Liquid Swords Untitled Project - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj03nvr0DiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, a few hours ago, Sundberg returned to the topic of Just Cause. In a series of tweets <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1985287755199352973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on X</a>, he stated that it is unlikely we'll see a fifth mainline installment from Avalanche Studios.</p>



<p><em>Me and my team pitched Contraband back in 2017 to MSFT (and signed it). It's changed quite a lot since then, obviously, but it would have been fantastic to see it being released one day somehow. Just Cause 5 would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.</em></p>



<p><em>It's a qualified guess. The problems with JC4 was partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise.</em></p>



<p>When a follower told him that Just Cause 5 would save the company, Sundberg replied:</p>



<p><em>I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off and make games the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not to fit into one. </em></p>



<p>Indeed, the Swedish development studio has fallen on hard times lately. The aforementioned Contraband project was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down by Microsoft in August</a>, which led to the closure of the Liverpool office and to layoffs at the Stockholm and Malmö teams. In June 2024, Avalanche Studios had already closed offices in Montréal and New York, laying off another fifty employees. </p>



<p>The last franchise entry to be released is 2018's Just Cause 4, which received mixed reviews. In Wccftech's review, Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/just-cause-4-workmanlike-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ultimately, I found Just Cause 4 was most satisfying when I hopped in a chopper or found a good gliding spot and just took a minute to appreciate the world Avalanche has built. These quiet moments were a nice vacation from the rest of the game, although the fact that I needed that escape maybe isn’t a rousing endorsement.</em></p>



<p>The game also failed commercially. Publisher Square Enix would later admit that its sales did not cover development costs.</p>
