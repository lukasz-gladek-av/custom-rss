			<p>Today's AWS Outage <a href="https://wccftech.com/aws-outage-snaps-chatgpt-fortnite-down/">took down about half of the internet</a>, with apps and services across industries suffering issues throughout the day. Thankfully, we're starting to see the service slowly crawl back to life, which means that major gaming services that were taken down, like Fortnite, Roblox, and PSN are starting to recover.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Epic Games is reporting "<em>All Systems Operational</em>" <a href="https://status.epicgames.com/">on its service status website</a>, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-halloween-sale-2025/">Epic Games Store</a>, Fortnite, Rocket League, and Unreal Engine. Roblox is still reporting the issue as an "<em>Active Incident</em>" at the top of <a href="https://status.roblox.com/pages/history/59db90dbcdeb2f04dadcf16d">its service status page</a>, though the last update on the timeline of the issue does state that AWS has informed Roblox it is back online and operational.</p>



<p>Regarding the PlayStation Network (PSN), PlayStation is <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">also reporting that all of its services are up and running</a>, and EA is also reporting its services across all of its games, including Battlefield 6, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/server-status/">are back online</a>, after players were reporting issues seemingly caused by the AWS outage.</p>



<p>The actual <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS Service page</a> is currently only reporting "<em>Impacted</em>" service in North Virginia, with other regions all listed as being operational. That said, if you do continue to encounter connection issues when trying to matchmaker in a game or even just connect to the PlayStation Store, and you've already ruled out your own internet as being the issue, then there might still be some lingering issues.</p>



<p>Hopefully, any outages will be cleared up soon, and these signs of recovery are already an indication that anyone looking to get some gaming time in today shouldn't have a problem, even if you're planning to play online.</p>

<p>Some other major titles on sale include Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced at 50% off, Red Dead Redemption 2 at 75% off, Cyberpunk 2077 at 65% off, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt at 80% off.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in April, ARC Raiders and Marathon both hosted playtests that coincidentally overlapped with each other, and according to Embark Studios' technical director, while that was entirely a coincidence, it proved beneficial for ARC Raiders and for Embark Studios.</p>



<p>Embark Studios just got done hosting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">'Server Slam Test' this past weekend</a>, where the game was available for free on all platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S) for players to hop into from October 17-19. As far as we know, it went well, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2427520/charts/">game's Steam concurrent players peaking at 189,668</a>, and it'll be interesting to see what Embark Studios takes from this playtest to implement in the final game.</p>



<p>Some learnings however didn't come from feedback on ARC Raiders at all. When speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">PC Gamer</a>, technical director on ARC Raiders, Virgil Watkins, admitted that Marathon overlapping playtest worked as a good compare and contrast for what Embark Studios was doing with ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>"<em>It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen</em>," said Watkins. "<em>It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>[It] was quite interesting to follow in what players thought about those certain things, or what did work in their context and didn't, and what may have worked in ours</em>."</p>



<p>Watkins doesn't identify any concrete examples, or claim that he and the rest of Embark Studios have been watching over Marathon like hawks, but it makes perfect sense that both teams would be eying each other, if only because they're both making extraction shooters.</p>



<p>While this past weekend's server slam test was undoubtedly popular, it'll be interesting to see how ARC Raiders does when it's on shelves. Unlike Embark Studios other major title, The Finals, it is not a free-to-play experience, so it doesn't have that same appeal of players being able to just give the game a try to see how they like it.</p>



<p>And with regards to Marathon, we know that Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">is hosting a closed test later this month</a> that is invite-only and under an NDA, though the future for that game is far more uncertain than the future for ARC Raiders.</p>
