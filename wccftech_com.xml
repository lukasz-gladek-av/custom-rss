			<p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will be among the Xbox games that will launch on other platforms in the near future, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during a recent podcast, well-known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a> talked about the Xbox games that will launch this year on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the obvious, the insider confirmed he heard that Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will launch on the other systems this year. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">yet-to-be-announced Oblivion remake/remaster</a> will be another game launching on consoles other than Xbox systems, although this is more speculation than an actual rumor based on the fact that there is no reason for the game not to be a multiplatform release. At the same time, the "loss" of two exclusives will be compensated with the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, which will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively, not only on Xbox consoles but also on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 probably won't have much trouble running the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, it will be very interesting to see how the much more demanding Flight Simulator will run on the next Nintendo system. If recent rumors are any indication, these ports may be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">scaled-down versions of the Xbox Series S versions</a>, which would make sense considering the system is currently the less powerful current generation console.</p>
<p>The launch of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 would be a landmark moment for Microsoft, further highlighting the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-xbox-fans-are-being-redefined-into-enjoying-games-on-all-their-devices-i-feel-very-good-about-the-gaming-division/">shift in strategy. </a>Hopefully, it won't take much longer to know if PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo Switch 2 owners will be able to experience the first few entries in the series on their platform of choice.</p>
