			<p>UK-based studio Maze Theory (which previously made several Doctor Who VR games and Peaky Blinders: The King's Ransom) and publisher Vertigo Games have just announced the release date of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thief: Legacy of Shadow</a>, a new stealth action game coming out on December 4. Unfortunately, the game will only be available for virtual reality devices, which still comprise a minuscule portion of the overall gaming industry. That said, if you are a VR aficionado, chances are you already have a PlayStation VR2, Quest 2 or 3, or a Steam VR-compatible headset.</p>



<p>Legacy of Shadow will bring players back to The City eleven years after the 2014 reboot by Eidos Montréal. Just like in previous Thief games, The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the powerful and feared by the oppressed. Its rooftops form a maze above the narrow, winding streets. The City Watch prowls the streets relentlessly, enforcing the iron will of Baron Ulysses Northcrest — a tyrant who crushes any hint of rebellion.</p>



<p>In Thief: Legacy of Shadow, you won't play as Garrett, the protagonist of the franchise's previous entries. Instead, you'll step into the shoes of Magpie, a cunning thief who was orphaned by Northcrest's brutality and then shaped by the streets. Stealing is Magpie's only means of survival. That is, until she uncovers a legendary artefact holding a legacy from the past. That's when she is forced to unravel The City's darkest secrets and expose the sinister conspiracy looming over its very foundation.</p>



<p>The developers have implemented immersive VR-centric game mechanics to allow players to steal, evade and outsmart the forces controlling the city. </p>

<p>Players can look forward to pickpocketing guards, prying open hidden compartments, and bypassing locks using tactile VR interactions. Thief: Legacy of Shadow promises players a range of arrows and tools to distract, disable, or eliminate threats through immersive VR archery. Additionally, Maze Theory stated that every heist offers multiple paths and playstyles, allowing players to decide whether to sneak past guards unseen or take them down from the shadows.</p>

			<p>Today, Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that the Call of Duty movie has secured a director and a writer: Peter Berg and Taylor Sheridan. Berg will direct and also co-write alongside Taylor Sheridan.</p>



<p>Berg is known for directing several action thriller movies, including 2007's The Kingdom, 2013's Lone Survivor, and 2018's Mile 22. Sheridan, on the other hand, is primarily known as the creator of the Yellowstone franchise (as well as Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, and Lioness), but he also wrote the two Sicario movies. Berg and Sheridan worked together on Hell or High Water, the acclaimed 2016 crime drama film that garnered four Academy Award nominations.</p>



<p>Presumably, the news means the Call of Duty movie adaptation is being fast-tracked. That is because the rights were picked up by Paramount, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed last month</a>, and Sheridan's time with Paramount will come to an end in 2028. From January 1, 2029, he will be busy working on film and TV shows for NBCUniversal as part of a five-year deal. Still, there is no official news on casting yet, so it may be a while before we hear who Berg and Sheridan have in mind for their story. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Call of Duty is preparing to launch Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14</a>. The game features a story campaign that picks up the narrative thread of Black Ops 2. Set in 2035, the story will follow JSOC Commander David 'Section' Mason (played by actor Milo Ventimiglia) and his Specter One team as they investigate the return of the deceased Nicaraguan terrorist Raúl Menéndez, who threatens to 'burn the world down' in three days. Specter One also includes operatives Mike Harper (Michael Rooker), Eric Samuels (John Eric Bentley), and Leilani '50/50' Tupuola (Frankie Adams), as well as Colonel Troy Marshall (Y'lan Noel), who oversees JSOC's Tier 1 operations. Also involved in the Menendez investigation is 'The Guild', a former criminal organisation turned technology corporation, led by its CEO Emma Kagan (Kiernan Shipka).</p>
