			<p>Rainbow 6 Siege X will launch in June 2025, opening up a new era for the game with the biggest and most transformative evolution in its ten-year history.</p>
<p>The new trailer shared today, which can be watched below, provides a new look at what Siege X will bring, such as a major visual overhaul, an enhanced player experience, and some gameplay changes that will improve the game's tactical core.</p>

<p>Some of the new features that will come with Rainbow 6 Siege X this June include a new play mode called Dual Front, a permanent 6v6 game mode that will be set in the game's biggest map to date. In this mode, players will be able to form squads by picking between 35 different operators and proceed to secure enemy sectors while defending their own. While this new play mode will only be available when Rainbow 6 Siege X launches, players will be able to test it out this week with a limited-time closed beta that will run from March 13th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET to March 19th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET. To get access to the beta, players will need to connect their Twitch and Ubisoft Connect accounts and watch either the Showcase on the<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Official Rainbow 6 Twitch channel</a> or other <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">livestreams</a>.</p>

			<p>Focus Entertainment Publishing and Saber Interactive have just <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1900226944853004392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the surprise announcement that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 is already in development.</p>
<p>Now, don't get us wrong—there was never any doubt that a sequel would be made, given the resounding commercial success of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, which, last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold five million units in less than three months on the market</a>. However, the timing is definitely sooner than anticipated, especially as the development team is still updating and expanding Space Marine 2. Indeed, the press release makes it a point to stress that an ambitious content roadmap is still planned for Space Marine 2, including the upcoming release of the Horde mode.</p>
<p>Anyway, Saber is promising even more spectacular and more large scale battles in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3. Here's what John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years. Today, we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with Space Marine 3. Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular.</em></p>
<p>Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive, added:</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber. ​ It is the culmination of everything we have learned about game development in our 25 years in the business. ​ We are now starting to develop Space Marine 3, a game that carries with it tremendous expectations from our rapidly expanding fanbase. ​ While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third installment. We view this as an opportunity to create a true love letter to the Warhammer 40.000 universe</em>.</p>
