			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2025, independent developer Raw Power Games unveiled its debut title called Chronicles: Medieval.</p>
<p>The studio is headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, although it has employees all over Europe, with a total headcount of around 100. Most are industry veterans, having worked on blockbuster games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Assassin’s Creed, Hitman, Red Dead Redemption 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and Grand Theft Auto.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 and the studio's proprietary 'Asgard' technology, Chronicles: Medieval is described as a 'dynamic medieval sandbox RPG' set in Europe's 14th to 15th centuries. Raw Power Games promises that players will get to write their story and forge their destiny in a living, breathing realm where every decision echoes through history and every sword swing could change their fate. Players will find intense combat where they fight for land, glory, and legacy, leading massive armies into tense battles.</p>
<p>Andrzej Zawadzki, Senior Designer at Raw Power Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Whether players dream of carving out a kingdom, leading armies into battle, or becoming the most prosperous trader, history is written by their hand in Chronicles: Medieval. As we unveil the game and move towards an early access release, we plan to listen and work with our community to make our first game a truly epic adventure.</em></p>
<p>Clemens Koch, Senior Community Manager, added:</p>
<p><em>We believe the best ideas often come from players themselves, and we look forward to building the game with our community, offering early playtests and feedback sessions. To learn more about Chronicles: Medieval and engage, we encourage players to join our dedicated Discord channel.</em></p>

<p>In the game, players will create their own character before embarking on a journey filled with struggle and opportunity in equal measure. They'll be able to recruit, train and lead troops into epic battles, enjoying full customization and control. They can take command of large-scale battles and also fight directly on the front lines in third-person view. There are even custom battles available in co-op mode.</p>
<p>Chronicles: Medieval features historical units such as the sharp-shooting English longbowmen, the devastating French cavalry, and the formidable Imperial polearm infantry. The combat aims to deliver an engaging and authentic medieval experience, featuring fluid weapon mechanics with a focus on realism. To achieve that, Raw Power Games has partnered with Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) expert Björn Rüther to capture the precision and weight of authentic historical martial arts. The game does not have a fixed narrative, allowing players to make their own choices and even pursue diplomacy.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the developers promised players the freedom, support and technology they need to create, share and reshape the game world. This sounds a lot like modding, although Raw Power Games did not elaborate further at this time.</p>
<p>Chronicles: Medieval is set to launch next year on PC in early access.</p>
