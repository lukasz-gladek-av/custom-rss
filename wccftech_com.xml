			<p>Xbox has confirmed through <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1937133550869876827">a post on X</a> that it will be attending Gamescom 2025, which likely means another showcase from the company sometime between August 20 and 24.<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1937136830014754891"> Bethesda</a> and the <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24215994">World of Warcraft team at Blizzard</a> will also be attending the event.</p>
<p>We've had a Gamescom showcase from Xbox each year since 2021, with last year's attendance including <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-3-days-of-livestreams-for-gamescom-2024/">multiple livestreams for Xbox games</a>. While we don't yet know what we'll see at this year's show, there are a few games we should look forward to seeing.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> event the company hosted, we now have a clearer idea of what's due out in the fall from Microsoft, meaning there's a good chance we'll learn more about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, which is currently set to release sometime before the end of the year. It could also be where we get the official announcement of the recently leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-leaked-ahead-of-announcement/">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</a> VR headset, and potentially some VR ports of Xbox games.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> could very likely get one more big marketing push before its October 29, 2025, release date. The same is likely for the recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle DLC</a> that's due out on September 4, 2025.</p>
<p>There's also a strong chance we'll see more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Black Ops 7</a>, after Xbox capped off its Summer Game Fest showcase with this year's entry in the Call of Duty franchise. Each game in the series is usually out sometime between October and November, so it's likely we'll get a release date reveal during whatever showcase Xbox hosts.</p>
<p>There's also a chance we see a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, which was also featured during the SGF event that Xbox hosted. We got a release window with its SGF trailer, so it's possible we'll get a proper release date with a new trailer for Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>And now that we have a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, it wouldn't be a surprise if Team Ninja and Platinum Games have a new gameplay trailer set for Gamescom 2025, and potentially a show-floor gameplay demo for those in attendance.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that even if Xbox doesn't host a livestream event, however unlikely that may seem, its attendance at Gamescom 2025 does make it likely that anything we've seen from the company that we know is coming this fall will likely be available to demo ahead of that fall release date.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll find out more official information soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Seoul-based game development studio Shift Up has finally released Stellar Blade for PC earlier this month. The game, originally codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-eve-looks-stunning-in-first-playstation-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project EVE</a>, was actually supposed to launch on PC right away alongside PlayStation 4 and even Xbox One.</p>
<p>However, when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-new-name-project-eve-visually-stunning-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resurfaced</a> in September 2022's State of Play stream as Stellar Blade, it did so as a PlayStation 5 exclusive with Sony Interactive Entertainment set to publish. Back then, the developers still hoped for a 2023 launch, but the launch had to be delayed until April 2024, when it became <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> for the PS5.&nbsp;<span>Shift Up&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a PC port and a sequel only a month later</span>, although this version of the action game took over a year to be released.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, quality is all that matters, especially given the current state of the games industry. Therefore, I'm happy to say that Stellar Blade on PC is a very solid port on all accounts. It doesn't even seem like Shift Up got any help from Sony's dedicated PC porting team, Nixxes Software, which makes the port's quality all the more impressive.</p>
<p>First things first. This PC version includes most of the technical bells and whistles we expect from a 2025 triple-A launch, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full support for Ultra-wide and Super Ultra-wide display (21:9 and 32:9), cutscenes included</li>
<li>Support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution (with the latest transformer model), AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, NVIDIA DLAA and FSR Native AA</li>
<li>Support for the DualSense controller's haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and controller speaker features</li>
<li>Support for High Dynamic Range displays</li>
<li>Six predefined frame rate limiter options (30 FPS, 45 FPS, 60 FPS, 120 FPS, 144 FPS, 240 FPS, and of course, unlimited frame rate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a few things are missing, like Intel XeSS, a 165 FPS frame rate limiter option, better HDR calibration options (they're the same for SDR: brightness, contrast, and UI brightness), and possibly a field of view slider, although the latter isn't really standard for third-person games.</p>
<p>Overall, though, there's more than enough here to be satisfied, especially since the game itself runs very smoothly. Powered by the Unreal Engine 4, Stellar Blade can run <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-gets-added-to-marvels-spider-man-2-mecha-break-rematch-and-dragonkin-the-banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at an average of 540 frames per second</a> on a GeForce RTX 5090 with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade PC 4K Gameplay Max Settings, NVIDIA DLAA" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T3gCmP8DXyI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this case, however, there's little reason to use Performance Mode when the frame rate is already so high. In our testing, we used NVIDIA DLAA while also maxing all the graphics settings and still registered a maximum frame rate of 423 FPS, an average frame rate of 377 FPS, and a minimum frame rate of 313 FPS, in a custom benchmark run of the Wasteland level seen in the video above.</p>
<p>Being an Unreal Engine 4, Stellar Blade on PC is not entirely devoid of the all-too-familiar stuttering we've unfortunately come to expect from the technology. When analyzing the data captured with FrameView, nearly 12% is labeled as stuttering. On the other hand, the rest of the gameplay is buttery smooth, delivering a great action experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Stellar-Blade-PC-Benchmark-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Sure, the game isn't the most visually demanding in 2025. It doesn't have path tracing, or even just ray tracing, or UE5's Lumen global illumination. Even so, the art style goes a long way toward delivering an aesthetically appealing experience.</p>
<p>The upside of launching one year later is that the game has been improved through several updates. Furthermore, there are two expansion packs (one themed around NieR: Automata and another around Shift Up's first big hit, the gacha Goddess of Victory: Nikke) that can be purchased separately or as part of the Complete Edition.</p>
<p>Overall, I'm having a lot of fun playing Stellar Blade. While it is a fairly straightforward experience could certainly have used more complexity (and more narrative, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> recently by Shift Up's CEO), it understands the core of what's entertaining about an action videogame, and that's why it has reached so many players.</p>

			<p>Where we’re going, we don’t need roads. Oh, how I wish that notable quotable from Doc Emmett Brown held true in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Truth be told, in my sixty-some hours of playing, I perhaps spent most of those hours lugging massive quantities of metal and ceramics halfway across Australia, just to build out another mile-long section of tarmac to make my trip on Pickup Off-Roader. Sure, it’s a vehicle that should be used off roads, given the name, but the reward for fabricating a new stretch of highway is a smooth cruise past any pesky BTs or MULEs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250612213722-scaled.png"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> opens in a way that many Hollywood sequels do, years after the original: the protagonist, having settled down with the comforts of daily life and a family, is pulled out of retirement for one last job. In Sam Porter Bridges’ case, that’s to head south into the Mexican frontier to bring them into the chiral network, a post-internet-connection that permits the transfer of knowledge and resources across vast distances. It’s here that the player is onboarded back into the role of being a porter and bringing goods from one distant point to the next. It isn’t long before Sam’s daily life is upended by a new antagonist, forcing him out of early retirement for good and venturing out into an even further frontier: Australia.</p>
<p>Kojima Productions has leaned more into science fiction and the implausible with the concept of harnessing the power of The Beach, a metaphysical realm where the dead wait before proceeding into the afterlife. Despite a brief story recap before getting back into Sam’s boots, there’s still much to The Beach and how it connects worlds that would need an hour-long video essay to unpack truly. The narrative to <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> weaves together impossible concepts and strange interpretations on known supernatural forces so effortlessly into the story that it almost feels insane watching actors chat back and forth about bridge babies (BB’s, for short), stillborn mothers, timefall rain, and many other such examples as if these were commonplace in the world.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250621165148-1456x819.png"></a></figure>

<p>Some time during my time with Death Stranding 2 for review, after most of my articles from Summer Game Fest 2025 were put to paper and published, the online servers were intentionally shut down ahead of release. For that last week or two, I braved the Australian landscape all on my own with only a few remnants of players I had connected with prior still littering the paths. Each time I’d pass that introductory stretch of highway leading to the Western Environmental Observatory, I’d pass by a generator dedicated by YongYea or some other internet celebrity with early access to Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>Over time, I would see all of the likes and Legend of Legends grades dedicated to one of these monuments and make it my personal goal to surpass them. After all, these were my only connections outside of the world that I was helping to rebuild solo on hours 25-50 of what I’ve played thus far. Perhaps if I spent less time hauling cargo to build out a highway all on my own, I would’ve gone on to finish Death Stranding 2 in time to fill out a complete review. As it stands, I’ve only seen enough of the story to reach the cutoff point that Kojima Productions requested to keep any spoilers down to a minimum. Going by a chapter count in the trophy list, I’m roughly halfway through the story (which isn’t saying much, as Death Stranding 2 features a similar chapter progression to the first game, with some chapters being played out in just a couple of story missions).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250622214655-1456x819.png"></a></figure>

<p>Combat remains a sore spot for me in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, much as it did in the first game. While the actual gunplay has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-could-last-nearly-twice-as-much-as-the-original-has-more-combat-because-people-ask-kojima-for-mgs/">massively improved</a>, with a much wider selection of less-than-lethal weaponry (and explosive ordinance/live ammunition when needed) at Sam’s disposal, the act of using it still feels cumbersome in the end. When it came time to clear a MULE base out to take back a mine they had hijacked, I felt much better playing it stealthily at long range with a silenced sniper rifle than I did trying to hit boots on the ground and take these enemy rogues out in CQC combat or with rubber pellet shotguns. The big, bombastic set-piece boss fights are also a bit of a chore and drawn out to where I’d much prefer to see the action played out in a well-directed cutscene versus actually taking part in it myself. I know that I’m in the minority here, especially with how well the combat feels, but I much prefer the laid-back aspects of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach to some of Hideo Kojima’s contemporaries.</p>

<p>Trying to sum up what makes Death Stranding 2: On the Beach such an interesting title is a gargantuan undertaking. What starts as a simple porter job, carrying parcels with love by foot from one point to the next slowly evolves into an adventure of building out infrastructure and automated networks, mining out resources in one corner of the map while traveling about to find a new hot spring fount or Australian wildlife to rescue for the local animal conservation in the next. Each time you feel like you’re getting a grasp on the porter loop, Kojima Productions throws in another system to contend with.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore. Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online. This is one title that I’ve been taking my time with and enjoying at my own pace, even if that experience has been hauntingly lonely the past couple of weeks.</p>

				<p>As impossible to to describe as the first, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a culmination of some of Kojima's best (and worst) ideas all in one package that's more cohesive and less coherent than anything his team has done so far.</p>
