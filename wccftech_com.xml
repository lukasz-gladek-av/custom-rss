			<p>After it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/"> initially set to launch on May 26, 2026</a>, Rockstar Games has announced that Grand Theft Auto VI will suffer at least one more delay, as the game gets pushed from May 26, 2026, to November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a brief post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Rockstar Games account. No specific reason is cited for the delay; Rockstar just says that it needed the extra time to hit the level of polish and quality it wants.</p>



<p>"<em>Hi everyone,</em>" the post begins. "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026. We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026.</p><p>We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and… <a href="https://t.co/yLX9KIiDzX">pic.twitter.com/yLX9KIiDzX</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In a reply to the post, Rockstar continues, "<em>We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern-day Vice City.</em>"</p>



<p>Earlier this year, when Rockstar announced its May 2026 date, a little more than a year before it would arrive, it seemed like that could be the final delay for the game. Not only had Rockstar called its shot a year out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">but reports had claimed it had no chance of arriving in 2025 anyway</a>. It felt like it was always going to have been a 2026 release, so now that we had a 2026 date, it felt fairly set in stone.</p>



<p>That said, this delay is absolutely not surprising, considering how much time, effort, and money has been poured into Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar and Take-Two will settle for absolutely no less than what they deem perfect, and will take all the time it needs to hit that quality bar.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> published shortly after the delay was announced, Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick commented on the delay, saying, "<em>When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally, we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-is-reportedly-laying-off-staff-in-%E2%80%9Cnearly-all-areas%E2%80%9D-of-its-western-offices.1346173/</guid>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC</a> alleges that Square Enix is laying off staff in "<em>nearly all areas</em>" of its Western offices, with staff in its Europe and US offices hit. There's currently no word from Square Enix on how many have been impacted by this layoff, but sources told VGC that just from Square's London office, 140 employees are at risk of redundancy.</p>



<p>The news was delivered to staff through an internal video call as part of a restructuring that Square had mentioned <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">in the progress report it published today</a>, the same report where it boldly claimed that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/">wanted 70% of its QA work to be done by AI by 2027</a>.</p>



<p>In the progress report, Square writes, "<em>a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency</em>."</p>



<p>This aligns with VGC's report, which includes the same wording from Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu, who also added that this layoff is intended to make Square more "<em>lean</em>" and <em>"agile</em>." The cuts will save Square 3 billion yen annually, according to the company's projections.</p>



<p>Along with the cost savings, the cuts are meant to bring work that developers are doing at Square Enix closer to home, so to speak. In the progress report, Square says the decision came by intending "<em>To strengthen development capabilities from a Group-wide perspective and to optimize resource allocation for maximizing the value generated by IPs, a further review of the development pipeline was conducted. As a result, a decision was made to close overseas development studios and shift toward consolidating development functions in Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>Square is not the only Asia-based developer moving away from branching studios in other parts of the world. Shortly after a successful launch for Marvel Rivals, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">NetEase cut its California-based team</a> as part a restructuring to keep work on the game closer to its home studio. NetEase also shut down two of its subsidiaries, one yesterday, and one today, as part of its continuing restructuring to limit the number of branching studios it has in the Western world.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/">Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down with the loss of NetEase's support</a>, and today, NetEase closed Toronto-based studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-closed-yet-another-game-studio-funded-just-two-years-ago/">Bad Brain Game Studios</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-entertainment-announces-ambitious-plans-for-the-future/">Relic Entertainment</a> has announced that a new DLC for Company of Heroes 3 is set to arrive later this month on November 27, 2025. The Company of Heroes 3: Endure and Defy Battlegroup DLC expansion will add four new battlegroups, each with its own play styles, new powerful units, and more when it arrives on PC later this month.</p>



<p>Each of the new battlegroups has been designed for both multiplayer and co-op/skirmish AI modes, with US Forces getting the Italian Partisan Battlegroup, the Wehrmacht getting the Last Stand Battlegroup, the British Forces getting the Polish Cavalry Battlegroup, and the Deutsches Afrikakorps getting the Kriegsmarine Battlegroup.</p>

<iframe title="Company of Heroes 3 - Endure &amp; Defy Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ryr8UF4SX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The teaser trailer shows a bit of the new battle groups in action, though Relic Entertainment said in a press release that it will be putting out more information about the coming expansion as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>The Italian Partisan battlegroup is a class of resistance fighters and saboteurs to help enhance your ground forces in battle. They can sabotage your enemy with tunnel networks to plant underground explosives, steal resources, and wreak havoc behind enemy lines. The Last Stand Battlegroup is all about defending the line with new vehicles to bolster your defences, while the Polish Calvary battlegroup add strong lancer sections to the front line. They especially thrive against veteran enemies.</p>



<p>When the DLC arrives, it'll be available at a 10% launch discount for its first two weeks. For those who've not yet even jumped into the base game for Company of Heroes 3, it'll be 60% off for a limited time as part of a Black Friday sale.</p>
