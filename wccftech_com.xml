			<p>Sandfall Interactive announced that its debut smash-hit RPG, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, has hit <strong>3.3 million copies sold</strong>, 33 days after the game launched.</p>
<p>"<em>We couldn't make that up</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892">post on X</a> from the game's official account reads. "<em>Another entry on the long list of surreal moments that your support has made real. Thank you all.</em>"</p>
<p>It's the latest sign that the stars definitely aligned to help Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 reach the audience of players looking for RPG's like Clair Obscur. Even the fact that the week it launched, it did so days after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered arrived, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">ended up helping out Clair Obscur instead of overshadowing it</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond not getting overlooked by an Oblivion remaster, the other major aspect of this milestone is the fact that, like Oblivion Remastered, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also launched into Xbox Game Pass, so millions of players didn't necessarily need to buy it to check it out. All in all, for a small team like Sandfall Interactive, they couldn't have asked for a better launch for their debut game.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur</a>, he had nothing but praise for it, writing:</p>
<p>"<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive's first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself</em>."</p>
