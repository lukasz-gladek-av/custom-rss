			<p>After it was rumoured to appear during today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>, once the showcase started, it didn't take too long for <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong> to appear, with a new trailer showcasing the second entry in the FFVII Remake Trilogy on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, and a release date, with it arriving almost precisely as predicted: on <strong>June 3, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Two weeks ago, the reliable insider NateTheHate pointed to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-launch-this-year-xbox-switch-2/">arriving on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S sometime this year</a>. Following that, yesterday, ahead of today's Partner Showcase, NateTheHate pointed to Rebirth appearing at today's showcase, as it supported a theory they have regarding how <strong>Square Enix</strong> will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/">begin its marketing campaign for <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Well, NateTheHate was absolutely right about everything so far. Not only did Rebirth appear during the Partner Showcase, but it was also given a release date, which, as he predicted, falls in June, in close proximity to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest.</a></strong></p>

<p>For Final Fantasy fans who only have a Nintendo Switch 2 available to them and haven't been able to play any of the games in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy so far, this is great news. Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong> is on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, those players can look forward to jumping into Rebirth when it arrives on Switch 2 this June.</p>



<p>For all other Final Fantasy fans that have already rinsed Remake Intergrade and Rebirth on other platforms, this hopefully means that NateTheHate is also correct about his prediction that, at Summer Game Fest 2026, we'll get our first look at the conclusion of the remake trilogy, which will also hopefully be a multiplatform release.</p>



<p>Speaking of other platforms, the only thing left unclear at the time of this writing is the arrival of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Xbox Series X/S. Presumably, it'll arrive on June 3, 2026, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 edition, just like how Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade arrived on both Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S at the same time. For now, Rebirth's Xbox Series release date has yet to be confirmed. We'll update this article when that information goes live.</p>

			<p><strong>NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</strong> cloud gaming service <strong>is turning six this month</strong>. As you might recall, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidias-cloud-gaming-service-geforce-now-is-officially-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it launched right as the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong> started spreading globally in February 2020</a>. The service has undoubtedly greatly improved over the last few years, convincing more publishers to bring their games to the cloud and also continuously improving the backend technology to raise the bar for cloud gaming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as they did a few months ago with the <strong>RTX Blackwell</strong> upgrade</a>. </p>



<p>NVIDIA took the opportunity to confirm that <strong>GFN users have streamed over one billion hours of gameplay to date</strong>. Given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing memory shortage</a>, it wouldn't be surprising to see even more gamers turning to the cloud to play on PC.</p>



<p>Anyway, to celebrate the anniversary, <strong>NVIDIA is adding 24 PC games to the supported GeForce NOW list this month</strong>, starting this week with the following titles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Indika (New release on Xbox, available on Game Pass, Feb. 3)</li>



<li>Menace (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass, Feb. 5, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>



<li>World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade Classic Anniversary Edition (New release on Battle.net, Feb. 5)</li>



<li>PUBG: BLINDSPOT (New release on Steam, Feb. 5, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>



<li>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift (New release on Steam, Feb. 6, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>



<li>Delta Force (Steam)</li>



<li>Fallout Shelter (Steam)</li>



<li>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition (Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Roadcraft (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Wildgate (Epic Games Store)</li>
</ul>



<p>The best is yet to come, though, with <strong>CAPCOM's Resident Evil Requiem</strong> undoubtedly set to be the most played GeForce NOW game when it launches in late February. Here's the rest of the February 2026 list:</p>
