			<p>11 bit studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has revealed</a> its new revised roadmap for Frostpunk 2, a game that was released in September last year. Since it was released, it has been a huge success, with the developers saying that it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/">profitable three days</a> after its release, with sales topping 350,000 by that point. Since then, the team has been hard at work on updating the game, adding improvements and fixes to the game, while working on some of the upcoming major updates that would be added.</p>
<p>11 bit studios did initially release a roadmap in November, where it was announced that there would be a free update, as well as console ports in the future. Since then, the studio has released a revised roadmap, which can be seen on Steam. In the roadmap, those interested can get a more accurate timeline as to when the updates and ports will be added to the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>First and foremost, the free major content update will be released on May 8. The text that announces it reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>A day to be remembered: a&nbsp;<strong>Free Major Content Update</strong> that will adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first new Londoners.</em></p>
<p>After the first major update is released for Frostpunk 2, those on consoles can expect to get their hands on the game after waiting just under a year for it. It doesn't have a set release date for console, but the developers have stated that Frostpunk 2 is set to release on console in the Summer. It's set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but there is no mention of the game being ported to last-gen consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. Whether it will be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 when that console releases remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Aside from the free content update and the port of the game to consoles, Frostpunk 2 has a major lineup for 2025 at the very least. The Spectrum DLC is set to release in the Fall, and the developers have left the cryptic message with it that it will "help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one."</p>
<p>After the Spectrum DLC, the Aurora DLC is also slated to release this year, but depending on how the development and porting goes of the first three major highlights of the roadmap, it may end up pushed into 2026.</p>
<p>Looking into next year, there is a third DLC planned for Frostpunk 2, adding even more content to the game. It's not said yet what is planned for either the Aurora DLC or the third DLC, but more information is bound to be released by 11 bit studios in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. has released its <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/WBD-4Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial summary</a> for the final quarter of 2024, as well as an overview of the year as whole. While most of it does focus on its other subsidiaries, such as television and film, it does discuss the earnings of the gaming division.</p>
<p>For many, it doesn't come as a surprise to find that Warner Bros.'s Gaming division did not have a good financial year at all, and revenue was down overall. According to the report, the game division's revenue had decreased by 29%, which isn't too surprising considering that the company didn't have any major releases compared to when Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 were released in the prior year quarter.</p>
<p>Aside from the company's revenue, it has released some devastating news as of late, where it was announced that three of its studios were going to be closed. These studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith Productions</a>, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. Thus far, the reception to this announcement has not been taken well, as these studios had incredibly talented teams that produced some great games over the years, including F.E.A.R. and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, for example. A lot of the fan irritation comes from the fact that these companies were never given the opportunity to make further brilliant games like the Middle-earth titles and instead felt that they were being "sat on." Along with the news of the studio closures came the news that the Wonder Woman game that was in development would no longer be released.</p>
<p>The two major Warner Bros. games that were released in the last year both did not perform to expectations. So much so that both <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-ends-in-january-2025-offline-mode-and-deathstroke-out-now/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">MultiVersus</a> are both closing down as a result of this before the games had even been in general release for a year. Moreover, MultiVersus was technically in a bizarre beta-early Access limbo phase for a long period of its lifespan and spent even less time fully released to the gaming market.</p>
<p>In the report, it's also mentioned in the Q4 2024 highlights that Games content expense had decreased 20% ex-FX, which was driven by lower revenues, with it being partially offset by additional impairments. In total, it came to $50 million for the quarter, and $384 million for the year.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has been having an incredibly tough time with its gaming division as of late, and it'll need a really magnificent game to help the company pull through. There is the possibility of more potential Batman games, as James Gunn recently mentioned that he has been in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop further <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/">DC games</a>. However, it has not been stated what these games could be.</p>
