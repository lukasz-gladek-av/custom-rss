			<p>GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a few days after the debut of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl that over a million units of the game had already been sold. That is in addition to all the PC and Xbox users playing it through Game Pass. The game was in development for a very long time, though, raising questions about its&nbsp;profitability.</p>
<p>However, GSC Game World investor Maksym Krippa told <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes Ukraine</a> that STALKER 2 is actually already profitable, despite the company's expense of 'tens of millions of dollars' for development and marketing. Moreover, Krippa also revealed that talks are underway with Netflix for a potential adaptation. The game would join a growing list of game adaptations making it to the small and big screen, as film and TV production companies realize the intrinsic potential of the largest game franchises.</p>
<p>On TV, the most successful adaptations have been The Last of Us on HBO and Fallout on Amazon Prime Video. Twisted Metal and Like a Dragon: Yakuza got mixed receptions in their debut seasons, while Resident Evil and Halo have already been canceled after one and two seasons, respectively.</p>
<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog movies and Uncharted have recently been successful in theaters, though the real blockbuster was The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> all records for a film adaptation. On the other hand, the Borderlands movie was absolutely terrible in terms of box office revenue and reception alike.</p>
<p>Let's hope the STALKER 2 film or TV, if it does happen, is a quality one. Meanwhile, GSC Game World continues to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-0-3-delivers-more-crash-and-bug-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve</a> the game with updates. There's a lot more on the way, including modding tools, multiplayer, DLCs, and more enhancements to the experience. The Ukrainian developer is committed to supporting the latest entry in its flagship series for a long time.</p>

			<p>If you're looking for a way to celebrate the festive season in Mortal Kombat 1, then look no longer. It's been announced today by Warner Bros. Games that new holiday-themed in-game events will be arriving at the game from December 19 through to December 30. These events will be staggered across the days, with each event providing different rewards upon completion. The rewards come in the form of new character palettes, of which the details will be provided below. The events comprise five new Towers of Time events, which are free events available to all owners of Mortal Kombat 1. Below are all of the details you need about these events so you can pick and choose which ones you want to participate in based on the character palettes that you can unlock.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloody Snow&nbsp;</strong>Tower (December 19-25) - Yuletide Necromancer &amp; Christmas Evil character palettes for Quan Chi</li>
<li><strong>Naughty List</strong> Tower (December 21-26) - Souls of Winter &amp; Holiday Collection palettes for Ermac</li>
<li><strong>A Christmas Krampus</strong> Tower (December 23-30) Holiday Hero &amp; Winter Wonderman palettes for Takeda</li>
<li><strong>'Twas the Night</strong> Tower (December 25-30) - Angel on High &amp; Holidazzle palettes for Cyrax</li>
<li><strong>Final Present</strong> Tower (December 26-30) - Eat, Drink, and Be Lethal &amp; Bah, Humbug palettes for Sektor</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these character palettes, players will be given the option to purchase new holiday skins for Kameo Fighters Frost and Sareena, as well as the previously released festive skins Santa's Helper Reptile, Krampus General Shao and Mrs. Klause Kitana.</p>
<p>For those who aren't owners of Mortal Kombat 1 yet, there is now the option to purchase the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Kollection, which is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store. This collection includes the main Mortal Kombat 1 game, as well as the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion, the previous Kombat Pack, and 1,250 Dragon Krystals.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you already own the game but you don't have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/">Khaos Reigns content</a>, you can upgrade your version of the game with Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, which will provide you with a new story expansion, as well as Konbat Pack 2, which adds Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot to the game. There are also some new guest fighters on the way that will be added to the game via Kombat Pack 2. This includes Ghostface, who is already in the game, as well as one-week early access to guest fighter Conan the Barbarian, who is set to be released on January 21. T-1000 Terminator is also set to join Mortal Kombat 1 but doesn't yet have an official release date.</p>
<p>What character palettes will you be aiming for this year?</p>
