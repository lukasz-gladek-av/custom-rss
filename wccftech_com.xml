			<p>Grinding Gear Games released <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/">Path of Exile 2 </a>in early access last December, and hardcore ARPG fans have praised it for fulfilling their desire for a challenge that Diablo IV has been unable to satisfy. Today, in an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pathofexile">extensive live stream</a>, the studio delved into the many changes coming in its Third Edict update, which goes live at the end of this month on August 29, 2025.</p>



<p>It'll also be going live as part of a free weekend promotion, so if you've been curious about trying Path of Exile 2 for yourself, you'll be able to jump in alongside veterans of the game's early access period when the new update goes live.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest changes in this update include the removal of the Cruel difficulty level, with the studio introducing three interlude acts that players can go through as part of changes to the endgame experience. The introduction of trading is also, of course, major news for the player base.</p>



<p>The introduction of a new act, however, with Act IV being added to the game with this update, is the headlining addition for most players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the Third Edict is the addition of a new league, Secrets of Abyssal, which introduces a number of cool features for how players can adjust and re-adjust their character builds. </p>



<p>The full patch notes will reveal all of the specifics that hardcore fans of the series will want to dig into, but those won't arrive until a bit closer to the update's launch next week. For now, you can pore over the live stream and look forward to what's to come in Path of Exile 2 next week.</p>

			<p>The legal battle around Subnautica 2 between Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill and their former parent company KRAFTON continues, as the studio that Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire all co-founded, Unknown Worlds, has now <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM">filed a lawsuit against Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire</a>.</p>



<p>This comes <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/">a little more than a week after KRAFTON filed its own lawsuit</a> against Gill, Cleveland and McGuire, and since Unknown Worlds is wholly owned by KRAFTON, it appears that this suit is meant to pile on even more pressure on the three co-founders.</p>



<p>This new suit also includes what appear to be Slack messages meant to back KRAFTON's claims that Cleveland and McGuire were no longer working on Subanutica 2, and that they had moved on to personal projects while the rest of the team was left to pick up the pieces.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">filing their lawsuit against KRAFTON</a>, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire haven't added anything to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">long list of events </a>that encompass this story, and it's worth asking where this suit from Unknown Worlds originates.</p>



<p>It carries many of the same allegations that KRAFTON already laid out in its own filing, that Cleveland and McGuire allegedly "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at Unknown Worlds, which impacted development on Subnautica 2, and that the co-founders were prepared to release a sub-standard version of Subnautica 2 in the interest of earning the <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus</a> that has been at the centre of this entire dispute.</p>



<p>"<em>Acting out of pure self-interest, the Key Employees pushed to release any game - even one that was underdeveloped and had received a litany of disappointing reviews - into circulation on a timeline that maximized their earnout, even if it meant disappointing Subnautica's devoted fans and damaging the franchise</em>," the suit reads. </p>



<p>Is this just KRAFTON adding more pressure and filing a second time under the Unknown Worlds name, because it can, or does the driving force of Unknown Worlds filing its own lawsuit stem from members of staff genuinely taking umbrage with their former bosses? The truth of the matter is unclear, and though we tried asking KRAFTON about the intentions behind this suit and if it aligns with the views of Unknown Worlds staff, we received no response prior to publication. We'll update this story if we do hear back.</p>



<p>In the meantime, what is clear is that we are in the long haul for this dispute, and there are some questions about this situation that we may never learn the real answers to.</p>
