			<p>Following two <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-25-further-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delays</a>, Sports Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1887773293232668799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the cancellation of Football Manager 25 after 'extensive discussion with SEGA'. The development team said it will focus on developing the next installment in the football coach simulation franchise.</p>
<p><em>We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We have always prided ourselves on delivering the best value for money games that bring you countless hours of enjoyment, that feel worth every moment and every penny you spend. With the launch of Football Manager 25, we set out to create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation, laying the building blocks for a new era.</em></p>
<p><em>Due to a variety of challenges that we’ve been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven’t achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team. Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.</em></p>
<p><em>Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.</em></p>
<p><em>We could have pressed on, released Football Manager 25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that’s not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.</em></p>
<p>This cancellation affects all versions of the game, in case you were wondering. Automatic refunds will be issued to those who had pre-ordered the game. Furthermore, Football Manager 24 will not be updated with season 2024/25 data, as Sports Interactive said this would be a large effort that ultimately takes resources away from making the next installment.</p>
<p>A release window for Football Manager 2026 hasn't been shared yet, but the franchise has traditionally launched between November and December.</p>
