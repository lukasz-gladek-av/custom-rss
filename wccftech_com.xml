			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-video/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a> was released online a few days back, introducing new visual improvements in Central Yharnam and a few more areas.</p>
<p>Version 0.75, which can be downloaded for free from Nexus Mods, introduces some visual improvements via more gparam edits for each area, parallax occlusion mapping for certain surfaces in Central Yharnam, Cathedral Ward and a few other areas, and some upgraded textures.</p>
<p>Shortly following the release of the new version of the Bloodborne Remaster Project, the developer behind the project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, shared a new video on YouTube providing a look at the current state of development. Needless to say, the future is definitely looking good for the project, as the visual upgrades it will continue to bring wouldn't have looked amiss in an official remaster.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sony won't remaster Bloodborne, but I will" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zz5Nta-DB_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If it weren't for the quick development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-the-last-guardian/">ShadPS4 emulator</a>, Bloodborne would have continued to be playable only on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Unfortunately, despite the huge demand, Sony doesn't seem interested in officially bringing the game to PC anytime soon, so playing the game via the emulator seems like it will be the only way to go for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Bloodborne is now available on PlayStation 4 worldwide. The game can also be played on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, with some minor visual improvements.</p>

			<p>Arrowhead's Helldivers 2 made a big splash at launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling</a> over 12 million units between PC and PlayStation 5 in its first three months on the market. Player numbers dwindled afterward due to a few underwhelming patches, but they have since risen back slightly.</p>
<p>In a year without standard-setting game releases, it is not that surprising to see that Helldivers 2 managed to win the Game of the Year award (as well as the Best Visual Design and Best Technical Innovation categories) at the yearly TIGA Awards, hosted last week at Shoreditch Town Hall in London by the UK's games industry trade association.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Richard Wilson OBE, CEO of TIGA, stated: The TIGA Games Industry Awards 2024 showcase the incredible talent, innovation, and passion that define the UK games industry. Our Awards recognise excellence in studios of all sizes, super service providers and outstanding educational institutions. Congratulations to all the winners, nominees, and the entire community for making this such a vibrant and pioneering industry. Your achievements set the stage for an exciting 2025 in the UK games sector. I would also like to say a very special ‘thank you’ to our generous sponsors, who make the Awards possible.</em></p>
