			<p>Earlier this week, developers <strong>RocketWerkz</strong> and <strong>GRIP Studios</strong> announced that the console release for the popular survival game, <strong>ICARUS</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-console-edition-delay/">would be delayed by one month</a>, from its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-console-edition-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-february-2026/">February 26, 2026,</a> release date to <strong>March 26, 2026</strong>. Along with announcing the delay, the studios also confirmed that the team would host a Reddit AMA on<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivalGaming/comments/1r7k1p3/developer_ama_lets_talk_delays_survival_games/"> r/Survival Gaming</a>, during which <strong>DayZ </strong>creator <strong>Dean Hall</strong> (who is also the creator of ICARUS) called on consumers to help <strong>"<em>normalize delaying games</em></strong>."</p>



<p>The statement doesn't come in the form of an answer from Hall, but rather as a preface before the AMA even kicks off. Hall begins by writing, "<em>We need to talk <strong>frankly</strong> about delays</em>." He continues, "<em>Games cost <strong>a lot of money to make</strong>. Timing makes a tremendous difference to the cost of a game, so there can be huge impacts with delays [in] releasing a game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Players want quality and certainty, but it is my belief that developers latch onto this and get 'target fixation' about launches. Some of this is because of revene pressures, but much of it is wrapped up in perception. We are here today to <strong>break this perception</strong>. Failure to delay also leads to 'crunch culture.' So I am here today on a mission - <strong>let us normalize delaying games.</strong> You as consumers have the power to make it clear to platform holders (Xbox, PlayStation) that <strong>delays are okay</strong>."</em></p>



<p>When ICARUS: Console Edition was delayed earlier this week, the statement from the teams insisted that the game was in a "<em>strong and stable state</em>," but it chose to delay the game to give the team more time to polish it, "<em>rather than launch with known issues</em>."</p>



<p>In response to a question about game delays, Hall continued to discuss the issue, saying, "<em>I think most delays happen due to a failure to hit quality. And even when devs want to provide quality, they don't have the money they can spend to hit it. So they try to hide it, or ignore it. This is what happened with the ICARUS launch and we paid the price of going to 'Mixed.'</em> <em>As the studio got more fund security, we tried to break this cycle. <strong>But it is hard.</strong>"</em></p>

			<p>Today, Canadian developer <strong>Neojac Entertainment</strong> (known for the games <strong>Junk Survivor</strong> and <strong>Athos</strong>) announced that its next game, <strong>Frontier Legends</strong>, will debut this Spring on Early Access.</p>



<p>As you could probably guess from the title, <strong>it is a Western game</strong>, and also an open world title with survival and adventure elements. <strong>It casts players as a greenhorn settler</strong> fresh off the train, dropped into the rugged and unforgiving American West <strong>with nothing but ambition and a will to survive</strong>. Players can then become a hunter tracking game through dense wilderness, a trader running goods between settlements, a lawman keeping order on dusty streets, or even a bandit carving out a criminal empire, according to Neojac.</p>



<p>The game blends fast-paced survival mechanics with crafting, exploration, and base-building in an open world that features staples like dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and unscripted NPC encounters.<strong> One of the most ambitious features of Frontier Legends is its settlement-building system</strong>: players can grow their starting camp into a <strong>fully functioning frontier town</strong>, recruiting NPC settlers and assigning them roles in farming, crafting, gathering, and defense. The settlement's health reflects the player's leadership, so a well-managed town thrives, while a neglected one risks crumbling under the pressure of the frontier's dangers.</p>



<p><strong>Exploration is said to be central to the game's experience</strong>. Players will be able to venture beyond their settlements to discover ancient ruins, forgotten camps, legendary treasures, and hidden secrets scattered across the game world. There's also <strong>taming of wild horses</strong>, with each horse sporting unique attributes that make them valuable companions for travel, combat, and survival.</p>



<p>The game also supports <strong>cooperative and competitive multiplayer</strong>, though Neojac hasn't yet clarified how many players can play simultaneously. Anyway, <strong>players can team up to trade, build, and endure the frontier together</strong>, or take the darker path of raiding, betraying, and fighting rivals for dominance. Community events and seasonal challenges are planned to offer ongoing rewards and recognition.</p>
