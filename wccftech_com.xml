            <guid>1396084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Game Store's annual holiday daily giveaways have come to an end, and if you redeemed each of the games that were made free for 24 hours between December 18 and January 1 (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/">Hogwarts Legacy on December 11</a>), you just saved over $550 by not having to buy those games.</p>



<p>The giveaway ended with Epic giving away two games on January 1, 2026, instead of one: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-out-now-ps5-xbox-series-pc/"><strong>Wildgate</strong>, the PvP shooter from Dreamhaven that was released in 2025</a>, and <strong>Total War: Three Kingdoms</strong>. With those two games, and the fact that the Trine Collection was technically four games in one single day, the Epic Games Store gave away <strong>20 games this past holiday season.</strong></p>



<p>Totalling up the cost of the games at their non-discounted prices, you would have paid $567 USD to buy all of those games, including buying the four Trine games in a bundle as the Trine Collection. If you bought the Trine games individually, then the total goes up to $604.</p>



<p>That is not an insignificant amount of money saved if you're the kind of person who would have bought all of the games given away, which range in price and genre, from more narrative-driven and some smaller experiences that cost anywhere between $13-$30, to popular indies and even some triple-A titles costing between $40-$60. </p>



<p>Wildgate and Total War: Three Kingdoms will remain free for players to grab on the Epic Games Store until January 8, 2026, at which point the regular pace of one free game a week resumes, starting with Bloons TD 6.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games that were given away by Epic, starting on December 11, and then starting daily from December 18 through to January 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Dec. 11-18)</li>



<li>Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel (Dec. 18)</li>



<li>Eternights (Dec. 19)</li>



<li>Blood West (Dec. 20)</li>



<li>Sorry We're Closed (Dec. 21)</li>



<li>Paradise Killer (Dec. 22)</li>



<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Dec. 23)</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol (Dec. 24)</li>



<li>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Dec. 25)</li>



<li>We Were Here Together (Dec. 26)</li>



<li>Cassette Beasts (Dec. 27)</li>



<li>SKALD Against the Black Priory (Dec. 28)</li>



<li>Viewfinder (Dec. 29)</li>



<li>Trine Collection (Dec. 30)</li>



<li>Chivalry 2 (Dec. 31)</li>



<li>Wildgate (Jan. 1)</li>



<li>Total War: Three Kingdoms (Jan. 1)</li>
</ul>



<p>It's all together, not a bad list of games. It's not the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1plsdrt/epic_games_christmas_free_game_giveaways_leaked/">fake list that appeared on Reddit</a> that seemed to gain traction based on how people would've genuinely loved it to be real. But it's not a terrible bunch of 20 games.</p>



<p>That said, what is unfortunate is that several of the titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">including The Callisto Protocol</a> and Chivalry 2, were games that you might've already grabbed for free as a previous Epic Games Store giveaway. So you're not always getting something new to add to your library if you use the Epic Games Store.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-dlc-expansion-of-2026/</link>
            <guid>1396081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree alone</a>, 2025 did not reach the same bar<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/"> that 2024 did with regard to the DLC and expansions</a> released this past year. It wasn't a bad year, but it just didn't match up. Thankfully, there's at least one upcoming expansion that could be 2026's Shadow of the Erdtree moment, and a few more on their way that'll help round things out.</p>



<p>Here are our picks for our Most Anticipated DLC/Expansion releases set to come in 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/">Platformers</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hollow-Knight-Silksong-Sea-of-Sorrow-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight Silksong: Sea of Sorrow. Image credit: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Considering the fact that we went so long without any sign of Hollow Knight Silksong, it almost didn't feel real when its first expansion, Sea of Sorrow, was announced halfway through December 2025. Even more unbelievable (and exciting) was its 2026 release window.</p>



<p>We've gone from no Silksong to a lot of Silksong, and it is by no means a bad thing. The long-awaited sequel to Team Cherry's stunning 2D platformer Hollow Knight, Silksong was one of the defining games of 2025 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of the year's best, hands-down</a>. We don't know a lot about Sea of Sorrow save from this description Team Cherry gave: "<em></em><em>Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion, free for all players</em>."</p>



<p>Sea of Sorrow is sure to be one of the best expansions of the year, and is arguably the one expansion that could be 2026's Shadow of the Erdtree moment.</p>



<h2 id="h-super-mario-bros-wonder-meetup-in-bellabel-park-spring-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park (Spring 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Super-Mario-Bros-Wonder-Meetup-in-Bellabel-Park.png"></a><figcaption><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 last year, we got several upgraded versions of first-party Nintendo titles that didn't just arrive with visual overhauls, but with some small and some fairly-sized expansions along with them. It'll be Super Mario Bros. Wonder's turn to get the same treatment this coming Spring 2026, with the release of the Switch 2 edition and its expansion, Meet Up in Bellabel Park.</p>



<p>Meet Up in Bellabel Park doesn't exactly seem to be a new batch of 2D platforming levels, but something more along the lines of new challenges and mini-games that seem to really expand the co-op capabilities of the game. The whole of it could very well be greater than the sum of its parts. That was definitely the case with some of the Switch 2 versions of games already released.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-the-two-masters-early-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters (Early 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Two-Masters-DLC.png"></a><figcaption><em>Ninja Gaiden 4: The Two Masters. Image credit: Koei Tecmo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Koei Tecmo and Platinum Games' Ninja Gaiden 4 was one of the best action games of 2025. Not only did it make <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Wccftech's list for the Best Action games</a>, but it was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">nominated for Best Action game at The Game Awards 2025</a>. Now, at some point in early 2026, it'll get even better with the release of its first DLC, The Two Masters.</p>



<p>The coming DLC <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-get-two-masters-dlc-early-2026/">was revealed before the game's release in October 2025</a>, and while it is currently set for early 2026, we don't yet have a specific release date. When it does arrive, it'll add two new weapons for Ryu and Yakumo, along with new story content for players to dig into and most post-game challenges for those players who really want to test their ninja skills even further than the base game already does.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the new story content, weapons, and challenges come together for a solid DLC addition to what was already a stunning action game. </p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dlc-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl DLC (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stalker-2-Heart-of-Chornobyl.png"></a><figcaption><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Image credit: GSC Game World</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you're a fan of GSC Game World's intense survival shooter STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, then at the time of this writing, you might still be going through the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-new-free-content-on-december-16/">recently released free content update, Stories Untold</a>. While that update added eight new quests, seven new locations, six new characters, a new weapon and a new hub to dig into, it's not the first major DLC for STALKER 2.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-first-dlc-in-2026-no-news-multiplayer-cross-platform-mods/">That expansion is still to come</a>, which is what GSC Game World told <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/">Wccftech back in November 2025 in an interview with communications director Zakhar Bocharov and technical director Ievgen Kulyk</a>. We don't know a lot about this expansion, though having confirmation from GSC Game World on its 2026 arrival is what helps it make the list of our main picks over one of our picks for honourable mentions.</p>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-midnight-march-2-2026-pc">World of Warcraft: Midnight (March 2, 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/World-of-Warcraft-Midnight.png"></a><figcaption><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight. Image credit: Blizzard</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last but certainly not least, the final pick on our main list goes to World of Warcraft: Midnight, the eleventh expansion pack for the long-running MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">that is arriving on March 2, 2026</a>. Midnight introduces a few significant features, including player housing, a new opt-in Prey bounty hunting system, a new race, and a new Demon Hunter specialization. Four new zones, eight dungeons, three raids, eleven delves, and a new campaign to follow.</p>



<p>It's a whole bunch more World of Warcraft for players to dig into, and based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">conversation that Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo had with the team back at Gamescom 2025,</a> it'll be one of the more significant expansions in the game's history. </p>


<div id="democracy-1507" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1507,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Most Anticipated DLC/Expansions of 2026</strong></p></div>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>We can't include every upcoming DLC and expansion in our main picks, but the following honourable mentions still deserve your attention.</p>



<p>A note on our honourable mentions first. The first honourable mention is the Unannounced Witcher 3 DLC. While it seems likely that The Witcher 3 will get one additional expansion after all this time, we don't yet have the confirmation from CD Projekt RED that would make us confident to include it in our main picks. GSC Game World, however, has confirmed that STALKER 2 is getting its first proper DLC in 2026, which is what helps it make the list instead of The Witcher 3 potentially getting an expansion. </p>



<p>If CD Projekt RED were to confirm The Witcher 3 DLC, a return to The Continent would absolutely be one of our most anticipated expansions for the year. But since we don't even know if it's happening, we can only hope it does and represent that hope with the honourable mention below.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/">Unannounced Witcher 3 DLC</a> (We hope)</li>



<li>The Outer Worlds 2 DLC</li>



<li>Age of Empires IV DLC</li>



<li>DOOM: The Dark Ages DLC</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/if-the-duollistes-cant-defeat-you-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-will-clair-obscur-expedition-33-player-pulls-an-8-hour-shift-performing-over-10000-parries/</link>

			<p>Although modern video games can sometimes be too easy, some players still manage to find a challenge in them by performing extreme feats of mastery that attract the utmost admiration from each game's community.</p>



<p>Despite being a turn-based role-playing game where such feats often boil down to build-perfecting and long hours of grinding, with its parry mechanics, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em></strong> allows for some masterful play that can enable underleveled characters with an unoptimized build to defeat some of the most powerful bosses in the game... <strong>pulling an 8-hour shift.</strong></p>



<p>On the game's <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official subreddit Expedition 33</a></strong>, user <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Recordbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recordbreaks</a></strong> proved their name is no joke by sharing a screenshot of the result screen after their battle against the <strong>Duolliste Boss</strong>, the most difficult boss fight added to the game with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/"><strong>Thank You Update released for free last month.</strong></a></p>



<p>The numbers on the screenshot speak for themselves. <strong>Recordbreaks</strong> defeated the powerful boss in <strong>8:02:36 minutes</strong>, successfully <strong>parrying 10,545 times</strong> over the boss's two phases, a feat that is made even more impressive not only by the boss's moveset featuring some <strong>unnatural parry timings</strong> meant to throw players off but also by the <strong>huge pressure</strong> this player will have felt during the gruelling 8 hours spent fighting this boss.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AdHoc Studio’s Dispatch Reaches Over 3 Million Copies Sold to Close Out 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studio-dispatch-over-3-million-copies-sold/</link>
            <guid>1395925</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We're officially in 2026 at the time of this writing, and everyone across the world is simultaneously looking back at the year that was and ahead at what's to come. For Dispatch developer <strong>AdHoc Studio</strong>, that reflection took the form of a highlight reel showing off several in-game statistics about how active players have been in their debut game, and capping the video by announcing the game had sold <strong>over 3 million copies</strong> since launch.</p>



<p><strong><em>Warning! Spoilers for Dispatch to follow.</em></strong></p>



<p>The video was shared <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/2006757644250337294">across the studio's official social media accounts</a>, thanking players who dove in and dispatched <strong>over 1 billion heroes</strong> over the course of <strong>52.5 million completed shifts</strong> and <strong>727 million distress calls</strong> answered. It also included a few stats based on the choices players made, including 2.8 million players choosing to cut Coupe from Z-Team, and 1.6 million choosing Sonar.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 2.3 million players added Waterboy to the team, and 2 million added Phenomaman. Perhaps the more significant stat regarding the game's story was the fact that 2.4 million players chose to keep Invisigal on the team, while 1.1 million of them cut her. Invisigal was also the character that more Dispatch players romanced over Blonde Blazer by a margin of 0.9 million, while 164K players stayed single and didn't romance anyone.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ahead of the final stat (the over 3 million players), another key figure that popped up was the fact that people watched over 23 million hours of Dispatch-related content on YouTube and Twitch. Copies sold are one thing, but it's also incredibly significant in today's day and age to have a game with that much virality to it.</p>



<p>All together, it's clear that Dispatch has been an incredibly successful return <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-telltale-devs-the-wolf-among-us-2-adhoc-dispatch/">for the former Telltale developers at AdHoc Studio</a>. The game is currently not available on subscription services like PS Plus or Xbox Game Pass (it's not even out on Xbox yet), so those 'over 3 million dispatchers' the video lists each represent a copy of Dispatch sold. A huge achivement for any game, let alone one with an entirely narrative-over-gameplay focus.</p>



<p>Dispatch was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2025-weird-and-wondrous-tales/">Wccftech's Best Adventure games of 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of our Best Games overall</a>. Hopefully, this level of quality not only continues, but improves as AdHoc Studio moves towards its next project, whether that's more episodes of Dispatch or something else entirely. In any case, the game is due to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/">another injection of players when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 on January 29, 2026</a>.</p>
