<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon launched in late May after a sizable early access period. The game earned itself a decent fanbase on Steam, where it is estimated to have sold between 520K and 645K units. Steam user reviews are also very positive, with an 88% rating. However, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tainted-grail-something-wyrd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 6.5 out of 10</a> due to some severe bugs:</p>



<p><em>Alas, my fifty-hour playthrough of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon ended with a whimper as I could do little more than roam around the two maps I had fully cleared, a world thatâ€™s beautiful when you stop to examine the splendor but is interrupted by hitches and slowdown the moment you start walking forward. Perhaps in another few months time, once Questline has had the time to patch out the game-crushing bugs, this is one trip to Avalon worth checking out.</em></p>



<p>Hopefully, this patch has solved them.</p>

			<p>The original PlayStation console launched in North America on September 9, 1995, making today, September 9, 2025, the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> of the platform in this part of the world. PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/announcing-playstation-30th-memories/">announced</a> a 'Memories' campaign as part of its 30th anniversary celebrations, but a more interesting tidbit about PlayStation's history came from Circana executive director, Mat Piscatella, who revealed that, per Circana's extensive sales tracking data, almost half of the best-selling games on PlayStation consoles for the entire platform's history are Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u">posted</a> the sales chart as his own 'happy birthday' to the PlayStation platform, revealing the top-20 best-selling games on PlayStation devices in the United States for the past 30 years as of July 2025 by both dollar sales and units sold. </p>



<p>If we're looking at dollar sales, then 11 out of the top 20 best-selling games on PlayStation in the US are Call of Duty games. If we're looking at units sold, then Call of Duty games take up nine spots out of the top 20.</p>







<p>Interestingly, on the dollar sales side of the chart, the only first-party, PlayStation Studios titles to make the list are Insomniac's games from the last seven years: Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. On the units sold side of the chart, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Marvel's Spider-Man once again make the list, with Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and Sony Santa Monica's God of War (2018) being the only other first-party games.</p>



<p>Another interesting entry on the list is Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock making the dollar sales side of the chart in the number 10 spot. Guitar Hero was extremely popular in its day, though surely it's the added cost of having to buy the plastic guitar controller that boosts it to its place on the list.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the top spot for both dollar sales and units sold is occupied by none other than Grand Theft Auto V. For units sold, Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) make up the rest of the top five for units sold.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022), and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 make up the rest of the top five on the dollar sales side of the chart.</p>



<p>This chart is a clear example of how popular the Call of Duty series is in the United States, and that despite series like The Last of Us, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man being such key components of PlayStation's identity, they are unable to make a dent in the kinds of numbers that Call of Duty is able to pull, year after year. </p>
