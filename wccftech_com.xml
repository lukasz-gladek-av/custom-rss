			<p>When Paradox Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that two of the clans available in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, Lasombra and Toreador, would be locked behind a day-one DLC, Shadows and Silk (or the purchase of the Premium Edition), it was not hard at all to imagine a community uproar. </p>



<p>That is indeed exactly what happened. After a few days of mulling, it seems like Paradox is willing to make some fixes to that, as reported by Community Manager DebbieElla on the official Discord channel.</p>



<p><em>We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we're making adjustments ahead of Launch to reflect this.<br>We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible. In the meantime, please join us tomorrow on Twitch at 17:00 CEST, where we'll be showing off more of the game!</em></p>



<p>We'll have to wait some more time to learn exactly what Paradox plans to do to allow Bloodlines 2 players to select Lasombra or Toreador as Phyre's vampire clan without having to get the $21.99 Shadows and Silk DLC. </p>



<p>I recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pre-gamescom-2025-hands-on-a-tasty-morsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got my hands on a Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 demo</a> before Gamescom 2025, but there's more content coming from Gamescom itself, so stay tuned. Meanwhile, here's a quote that sums up my first impressions of the game:</p>



<p><em>There was much cause to worry about Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, especially after such a highly anticipated RPG sequel was given to a developer with no prior experience crafting roleplaying games. From the little taste I played, though, I think the folks at The Chinese Room have done well in most regards. It may not turn out to be a spectacular masterpiece like The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring, but I reckon it is likely to be a solid and fun action RPG with a great neo-noir story, at least based on the intriguing premise seen in this demo.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/itsuno-left-capcom-because-he-didn%E2%80%99t-want-to-make-dmc-and-dd-sequels-until-retirement.1281468/</guid>

			<p>Yesterday, news <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideaki-itsuno-brings-several-ex-capcom-developers-to-lightspeed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke</a> that Hideaki Itsuno had recruited several fellow former CAPCOM developers to his new LightSpeed Japan Studio, which is also opening a new office in Osaka in addition to the existing one in Tokyo.</p>



<p>Now, through <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-director-hideaki-itsuno-explains-why-he-left-capcom-and-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Itsuno has finally explained why he decided to leave CAPCOM around a year ago. As it turns out, it was mainly because the Japanese publisher would have put him on more Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma sequels, while the game designer wanted to do something new before he retires.</p>



<p><em>For me, based on my age, this is my last chance. The gaming industry has decreased the number of AAA releases, and I was asked to create a new AAA by Lightspeed. I’m not young anymore, so more than “now it’s the right moment,” it’s more like, “this is my last chance” to challenge myself. For Capcom, creating Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma sequels is always going to be the top priority, and keeping in mind that making a game takes 4 to 5 years, this might be my last big opportunity.</em></p>



<p><em>Before you realized you are working on making the Devil May Cry 6 or 7. It’s not like I don’t want to make them, I do, but it’s hard to balance the time it takes with the personal satisfaction of making them, and with Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon’s Dogma 2, I already did what I wanted to make.</em></p>



<p>It's definitely an understandable sentiment. Itsuno is certainly not the only veteran developer who recently decided to leave a big triple-A studio to work on something else of his own creation.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the developer says he is satisfied with how Dragon's Dogma 2 turned out (though personally, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I'd have to disagree on that</a>), and that he got more inspired by games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle than other action games after the release of Devil May Cry 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-sets-new-record-for-concurrent-users-on-a-gaming-platform-beating-even-steam.1281462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last Saturday, around 8 AM Pacific Time, Roblox <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bloxy.news/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> a new record for concurrent users on a gaming platform: 47.3 million users were online on August 23. That's 6.1 million concurrent users more than the peak registered by Valve's Steam platform in March: 41.2 million concurrent users. Earlier that month, Steam had <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-breaks-40-million-online-users-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the 40 million concurrent users milestone</a>.</p>



<p>Roblox's new peak is a massive jump compared to its previous record of 32.7 million users, which was set on another Saturday, July 19. Setting two records in the span of a month shows that the platform continues to grow nearly nineteen years after its original debut, which took place on September 1, 2006.</p>



<p>The game creation platform currently has two dominators: Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot. Together, they accounted for over 37 million of those concurrent users, meaning that more than 77% of the userbase was playing one of those games. Grow a Garden was the leader, with a peak of 22 million concurrent players, also a record for the highest concurrent peak ever recorded in a single game.</p>



<p>Originally developed by a sixteen-year-old player known only as BMWLux, Grow a Garden subsequently saw Splitting Point Studios and Do Big Studios purchasing shares and participating in its development. It's essentially an idle farming simulator where players start with a small plot of land and watch their plants grow into lovely flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Players can harvest and sell their produce to earn Sheckles, which can be used to purchase seeds, gear, eggs, and decorative items. They can also complete quests and participate in seasonal events to earn free seeds, gear, pets, and decorative items.</p>



<p>Steal a Brainrot also attracts many players to Roblox, with an estimated peak of 15 million concurrent players. This game was made by a user known as SpyderSammy, in partnership with another user known as do_small and developer Do Big Studios. It is described as a sort of tycoon experience where the goal of the game is to steal Brainrots from other players to earn money, which can be used to buy more Brainrots. However, others will try to steal yours, so you must defend them.</p>



<p>As a reminder, a couple of weeks ago, the state of Louisiana <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation, alleging that it is a breeding ground for sex predators and that its owners do not employ sufficient safety protocols to protect children.</p>
