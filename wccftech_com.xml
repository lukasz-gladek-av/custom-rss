			<p>Fellowship, a multiplayer online dungeon adventure game, or "<em>MODA</em>," as its developer Chief Rebel calls it, will launch in Early Access on Steam this coming October 9, 2025, developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have announced during the Future Games Show 2025 presentation. You'll be able to try it out ahead of that launch, though, as it'll have an open beta for players next month, from September 18-23.</p>



<p> "<em>All dungeons, all the time</em>," the trailer from today's Future Games Show boasts as it showcases new gameplay from the co-op adventure game, and that really is Fellowship's whole pitch. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo played the upcoming MODA earlier this year</a> ahead of one of its public playtests, he noted that "<em>strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to a press release, Chief Rebel plans to keep the game in early access for six months before reaching its 1.0 launch next year. While the early access version will include all the dungeons you might've already seen during public playtests or that you will see in the upcoming open beta, Chief Rebel is planning to have more playable content arrive as part of the 1.0 version. </p>



<p>The studio will also launch a cosmetics store with the full-game launch, though these cosmetics will remain optional and will not have an impact on gameplay. </p>



<p>Fellowship will be available for $24.99 USD on PC when it launches on October 9.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft doesn't have the biggest presence at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, but it's not entirely absent from the festivities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-xbox-game-pass/">The Rogue Prince of Persia was shadow-dropped</a>, and now a new province coming to Anno 117: Pax Romana has been debuted at the convention, alongside the news that fans will get their first chance to play it next month with a free demo launching on September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The new province is Albion, bringing its wet lands and expanding on Latium, the province that was first shown off and the one that houses Rome. </p>



<p>Albion is a Celtic province, and it'll be your choice whether you want to keep and encourage Celtic traditions or assimilate the province under Roman customs. Either is viable, but whatever you choose will require its own unique approach and will further shape your own journey in Anno 117: Pax Romana.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the demo coming next month, it'll only be available for a limited time, from September 2-16 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and of course, Ubisoft Connect. So if you want to check it out ahead of its launch this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">November 13</a>, then make sure to clear your gaming schedule for those two weeks, since there's no limit on how many times you can replay the demo.</p>

			<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is a new title from <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-developers-showcase-new-pvpve-extraction-shooter-hunger-in-first-gameplay-trailer/">Hell Let Loose</a> developers Expression Games and publisher Team17, bringing the tactical gameplay of Hell Let Loose and the massive 50v50 battles to "<em>a war with no front lines</em>."</p>



<p>Announced during the Future Games Show today, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026, as a specific release date wasn't announced. It builds on the original set in World War II with its signature strategy-focused gameplay, where you won't be able to win any battle on your own, and you'll need to communicate as best you can with the rest of your squad if you hope to stand a chance at victory.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam takes place during the Vietnam War from 1965-1973, and throws players into the country's jungles across six maps, and it introduces a new category of troops with aerial helicopter support troops, and the use of patrol boats. You'll also be able to take the fighting into the tunnels and construct them while playing as North Vietnamese soldiers.</p>



<p>Even with Hell Let Loose: Vietnam coming next year, Expression Games is clear that it will continue to be developed alongside new content for the original Hell Let Loose, according to a press release for today's announcement.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/high-on-life-2-launches-in-february-2026-new-gameplay-showcased-at-gamescom-2025.1276113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Squanch Games just debuted a new 42-minute gameplay demo for High on Life 2, the sequel to their <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/high-on-life-review/">comedy-driven first-person-shooter from 2022</a>, but more significantly for fans looking forward to the sequel, is that we also got an official release date announced, with High on Life 2 confirmed to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>February 13, 2026.</strong> It'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>



<p>Set five years after the events of the first game, High on Life 2 begins by charging you with killing a senator that the game swears is evil, who wants to turn humans into pills with his pharmaceutical company, and get even richer than he already is. As a human yourself, you (presumably) don't want that to happen, and so begins this new adventure. Simple enough, right?</p>



<p>Or at least that would be the case, if the real driving force behind the narrative wasn't the fact that there's a larger conspiracy in which you have been sent a bounty to go after your own sister, and the successful life you've been building as a bounty hunter gets thrown for a new chaotic loop as you unravel the mystery behind the latest threat to you and the rest of humanity. </p>

<iframe title="42 MINUTES OF HIGH ON LIFE 2 GAMEPLAY!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m__l_bB13UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One of the more significant changes in the sequel that the gameplay demo showcases is how the skateboard your character rides on has taken over the game's main movement systems. There will also be new weapons introduced, and new areas to explore as the game is set on a planet called ConCon that seems to be made up of a bunch of floating conventions.</p>



<p>It definitely looks like Squanch Games has ramped up the budget this time around, as well as every other aspect of the game. But we'll have to wait and see if it all sticks the landing, and if this sequel can actually deliver on a solid gameplay experience instead of just delivering a bunch of jokes like the first game, and your mileage may vary as to whether you even liked the humor in the original. </p>
