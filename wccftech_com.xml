			<p><strong>Embark Studio's</strong> new third-person shooter, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong>, isn't the typical third-person cover shooter you might remember from peak Xbox 360/PS3-era games. It's an <strong>extraction shooter</strong>, which means it's as much about the looting as it is about the shooting, but above all, it's about surviving.</p>



<p>You can fill your backpack with as much high-tier loot as it can carry, but it'll be all for naught if you can't make it back to your home base in Speranza alive. After playing for over a dozen hours (and climbing), there are a few things I wish I knew before I started raiding the surface of Calabretta.</p>

<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-start-raiding">ARC Raiders Tips and Tricks - What You Need to Know Before You Start Raiding</h2>



<h3 id="h-track-everything">Track Everything</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Look for the little Icon in the top-right, that tells you it's an item you need.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even when you're just starting out, going to the surface on your first quests, fighting new ARCs for the first time to try and get some high-tier loot, it can all feel a bit aimless if you're just filling your backpack with the first things you find. </p>



<p>You only have so many slots to take things home with you, and only one of those slots is your <strong>Safe Pocket</strong>, where you can place one kind of item to make sure it comes home with you. If you're just grabbing the first things you find as you search the various cabinets, boxes, broken-down ARCs, and any nook and cranny where loot can be found, you'll fill your precious slots faster than you'll realize.</p>



<p>That leaves you stuck in your inventory menu, managing items either by dropping them or swapping them out with an item you found you actually need, and now every breach and search you perform gets bogged down and wastes time, time you may have needed to make it to an elevator or hatch to make it back to Speranza safely. Not to mention the fact that you're leaving yourself vulnerable to other Raiders while stuck in menus. </p>



<p>Take a few minutes before you jump into your next raid, figure out what upgrades you want next, and track their resources. <strong>Only grab items that have a marker in the top-right corner of their box,</strong> indicating it's something you actually need for an upgrade you want. You'll have better, more efficient raids, and upgrade your gear far faster than if you grab everything you see.</p>



<h3 id="h-rely-on-yourself-before-traders">Rely on Yourself Before Traders</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-5-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The more self-reliant you are, the better.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you start ARC Raiders, you'll meet five traders: <strong>Celeste, Shani, Tian Wen, Lance,</strong> and <strong>Apollo</strong>. They'll each give you quests to complete as you dig further into the game, but they'll also sell you supplies across different categories, like <strong>Security, Guns, Grenades and Gadgets</strong>, and <strong>Health Items</strong>.</p>



<p>If you're having trouble holding on to resources and have the cash, then feel free to buy what you need from them, but, realistically, you'll likely never really need to use their shops. Or at least, once you build a <strong>Refiner</strong> for your workshop, you should be able to break down what you find up top into crafting materials you need, and craft what you're looking for at your <strong>Workbench</strong>. The money you acquire from selling any loot is still useful to have for a rainy day, but it's a far better use of your cash to expand the limit of your <strong>Stash</strong> before spending it all on items that you can craft yourself, especially in your earlier hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-experience-will-be-as-chill-as-you-want-it-to-be">Your Experience Will be as Chill as You Want it to Be</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-2-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There's a lot to be said about how multiplayer games with a PvP aspect should handle matchmaking. I won't get into the meat of it here, but for my money, the way Embark handles matchmaking, at least in my experience, is the way to do it. The team employs <strong>aggression-based matchmaking</strong>, which means you'll get matched up with more PvP-minded players the more you play with a PvP mindset.</p>



<p>But if you're not shooting at other players, if you're just greeting them with a friendly 'hello' and looting alongside them peacefully, then you'll keep getting matched with players of that ilk. ARCs are dangerous enough, and ARC Raiders is arguably a better experience when focusing on the common robot enemy, instead of your fellow Raider, who is just trying to survive.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not fool-proof, even when you go in Solo, which is usually where you'll get a better chance of finding other passive players. But if you want to try and make your looting experience a little safer, strong use of the <strong>"</strong><em><strong>Don't Shoot!"</strong></em> emote can go a long way.</p>



<h3 id="h-being-successfully-sneaky-is-more-audio-than-visual">Being Successfully Sneaky is More Audio Than Visual</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>All you need to do is duck into some bushes.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This isn't to say that you should walk into the sightlines of every ARC and potential enemy Raider you come across because you think you'll be far enough away that they won't see you. Maybe that'll be the case with an opposing player, but an ARC can still spot you from a certain degree of distance.</p>



<p>That said, the thing to focus on more than anything is how loud you're being when you're topside. <strong>You'll draw attention to yourself faster the louder you are</strong>, which is why you'll want to be as quiet as you can when up top. On the flip side, you also want to be quiet because it gives you more opportunity to listen closely for other Raiders.</p>



<p>As far as the actual sightlines for ARCs, though, often all you need to do is hide in some bushes to avoid their ire. It's not foolproof, and if you're hurt while trying to hide, your character won't be able to audibly hide the pain, and you'll draw attention to yourself, but it's often all you have to do. <strong>There's a serious lack of available cover Topisde</strong>, and you should try to keep an eye open for any hidey-holes to duck into if you suddenly find yourself in a fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-lose-track-of-time">Don't Lose Track of Time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-1-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Explore all you want, but don't lose track of time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you jump into a session, you're immediately met with a countdown at the top of your screen. It's telling you how much time is left before all the elevators on that map close, and you're left with having to find a Raider Hatch to make it back home.</p>



<p>Obvious as it may seem, <strong>you really cannot lose track of time</strong>. Particularly when you're in your early hours, if you start seeing you're getting to 10 minutes or less to get to an elevator, you should make getting to an elevator your only priority. If you're not paying attention to the map, then you're probably not aware of which elevators have already closed and which ones remain open. <strong>Your stamina only goes so far,</strong> so hoofing it across the map will take you more time than you think, and you can easily find yourself stuck Topside.</p>



<p>Plus, you don't always know what you're going to run into as you try to make the cross to an elevator, if you're not already near one. Losing track of time is the easiest mistake you can make while Topside, and you don't want to make getting home tougher than it already is.</p>

			<p><strong>Remedy's Alan Wake 2</strong> had a great reception when it launched in late October 2023. It received excellent review scores (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a 9 from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a></strong>), many awards (three at TGA 2023: Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction), and even became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-is-remedys-fastest-selling-title-at-1-3-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>fastest-selling game released by the Finnish studio to date</strong></a>, with <strong>over 1.3 million units</strong> sold as of February 2024. However, sales slowed down quickly afterward. As of late November 2024, Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to admit to its investors</a> that the development and marketing costs hadn't yet been fully recovered. That only changed in February 2025, when the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally broke the 2 </a></strong><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank"><strong>million-unit mark</strong></a>&nbsp;and began</span> generating royalties for the studio.</p>



<p>Obviously, this relative underperformance for a title that most genre fans agree is very well-made was discussed thoroughly by fans and industry professionals alike. Two of the main factors identified were <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/">th</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/"> lack of a physical release at launch</a> (which only changed a year later) and, most importantly, the fact that the PC version was and is still only available on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> rather than <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, by far the largest game distribution store on the platform. The permanent exclusivity of Alan Wake 2 didn't sit well with some gamers, who to this day refuse to install the Epic Games Launcher to buy and play the game. </p>



<p>The discussion on the subject was suddenly reignited this week by <strong>Larian's</strong> outspoken <strong>Director of Publishing</strong>, <strong>Michael Douse</strong>. It all started <span>with the comments of&nbsp;<strong>New Blood Interactive CEO Dave Oshry</strong>, who noted on social media that </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>giving away a game for free on the Epic Games Store also boosted sales of the same game</span> on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Addressing that claim, Epic Games founder and CEO <strong>Tim Sweeney</strong> <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717884711633121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> that 'gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals', adding with a jab to Gabe Newell and his famous acquisition of a massive yacht that <strong>the Epic Games Store is now '55-60%' of Steam's userbase</strong> and that, unlike Valve, the company is reinvesting some of its revenue into the Free Program to the benefit of both developers and users.</p>



<p>That's when Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went ahead to say</a> that Remedy '<strong>seemingly went into financial crisis</strong>' because of the game's Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC, losing '<strong>potentially hundreds of millions</strong>' by not launching on Steam.</p>



<p><em>I understand Epic entirely funded Alan Wake 2 but this altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial crisis because they couldn't tap Steam for AW2 sales suffering potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue.</em></p>



<p><em>Not that they need the money, but a % take to Epic could've recouped dev costs + more. Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic. Ultimately, the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of Fortnite players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and I don't see the Fortnite brand attempting to do that. The Apple &amp; Google stores spent a decade devaluing games &amp; apps to a point where it is largely impossible to sell a premium game there in a way that doesn't massively devalue it on other systems. Giving everyone everything for free might bump numbers but doesn't create a viable storefront from which to sell premium experiences.</em></p>



<p>In a surprising twist, Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually chose to answer Douse directly</a>, outlining that <strong>there would be no game at all without Epic's help</strong> and stressing that <strong>they received a 'very fair' publishing deal</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Hi. There would be no Alan Wake 2 without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy. While these complex deals can often take even a year to reach their conclusion, and may not always be fair to the developer, this one was. And it only took months to get done. Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us. Steam or no Steam.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, while Alan Wake 2 would have sold more if it had launched on Steam, it is unlikely that it would have really garnered a large amount of extra sales. The first installment sold a similar amount, after all, and it didn't have that issue. Moreover, it isn't like it's the only Remedy game to suffer this fate. <strong>The studio is known for its portfolio of great games that never quite sold as well as they should have</strong>, with the exception of <strong>Control</strong>, which is, however, in a much more popular genre. If there's anything the studio regrets right now, it is more likely to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>the disastrous</strong> <strong>FBC: Firebreak</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It was already excellent news for gamers (and for Epic itself) that <strong>a sequel was made at all, which was far from guaranteed</strong>, and even more so that it turned out to be <strong>a fantastic survival horror game</strong>, thus keeping the Remedy Connected Universe going. On that note, a new entry will be released this year: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, a full-fledged action RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made on a lower budget than Alan Wake 2</a></strong>, making it more likely to turn profitable in a short time.</p>
