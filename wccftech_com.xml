			<p>Despite having been released almost <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">eight years ago</strong>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em> continues to be among the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">most popular open-world games</strong> released in the past few years. As the game can still be enjoyed at <strong>60 frames per second</strong> only on PC, however, fans have been asking Rockstar Games for<strong> a current-generation patch</strong> to boost the game on consoles, but <strong>their pleas have fallen on deaf ears so far.</strong></p>



<p>Reportedly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-upgrade/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is getting a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S update</strong></a> in the future, alongside a<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, whose development is sure to be challenging enough even just taking the game's massive size of current versions of the game into account, but nothing has been announced so far. </p>



<p>However, we may have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">wait longer</strong> to see Arthur Morgan ride from New Hanover to New Austin in glorious <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">60 FPS on consoles</strong>, and it could be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s fault</strong>, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly commented on this <strong>highly anticipated update</strong>.<em> "I can tell you 100% I know 8 devs that worked on RDR2 next gen,"</em> Kiwi Talkz said on <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/2015523023701659724"><strong>X</strong></a>. <em>"It is a thing but Rockstar do whatever they want to do regarding release dates, maybe GTA 6 dev timelines changed the release schedule for everything, who knows, all I know is that I know devs have worked on it and it will come at some point."</em></p>



<p>Asked about a user regarding how long this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Red Dead Redemption 2 update has been in the works</strong>, Kiwi Talks couldn't talk about specifics, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Rockstar is heavily compartmentalised,"</em> and thus <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">sharing precise information</strong> could make it easy for Rockstar Games to know where it is coming from, which is a very sensible thing to do with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/"><strong>company that has shown not to have much tolerance for leakers</strong></a>. However, Kiwi Talkz commented on the matter to let fans know <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"the dream is not dead."</em></p>



<p>Although the reason for this long delay is unknown, Kiwi Talkz speculates it may have been due to the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> development timeline and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2-mobile-ios-netflix/">recent release of the Red Dead Redemption port</a></strong>. "<em>If I had to guess based on the limited info I know, I think they originally planned to release it earlier but because timelines changed with GTA 6 it massively delayed it,</em>" Kiwi Talks said. <em>"I personally don't think you'll see it now till late 2027 primarily because releasing RDR2 now would cut the wind out of RDR1s sales (which hasnt been out too long) and GTA 6 coming out late this year, they want GTA 6 dominating everything at least for a year before even entertaining the idea of RDR2 next gen."</em></p>



<p>If Rockstar Games is indeed waiting to complete development of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> and letting it dominate gaming, as<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> it is poised to do</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/"><strong>the game is not delayed again</strong></a>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will only see the light of day from <strong>2027 onward.</strong> </p>



<p><em>"Really excited to play it in the nursing home,"</em> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qmvsw2/comment/o1p5nym/"><strong>probablyuntrue on Reddit</strong></a>, echoing the <strong>wider community sentiment</strong>. <em>"Next consoles will be out by the time they release it,"</em> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qmvsw2/comment/o1p1pgx/"><strong>Blayzeman</strong></a>, voicing another concern among the community: will we be talking about a <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> PlayStation 6, next-generation Xbox port</strong> by the time GTA 6 is out and its full dominance established?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest<strong> RTX Remix path tracing mod</strong> to be <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-mod/addons/undying-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on ModDB</a> is dedicated to <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong>. The original game, an acclaimed first-person survival horror released by <strong>EA Los Angeles</strong> nearly twenty-five years ago, was made <strong>with the very first iteration of Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>With the power of NVIDIA RTX Remix, modder <strong>Pathtracedparadise</strong> heavily overhauled the visuals. Some of their work includes <strong>replacing more than a thousand of the original game's textures</strong> so far with high-resolution (2048x2048) PBR materials that have been upscaled with additional levels of detail added by running each texture multiple times through various Topaz Gigapixel models and then hand-edited as needed. The PBRFusion model was used to generate the PBR map via ComfyUI.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>this is still just an Alpha release</strong> of Clive Barker's Undying RTX Remix path tracing mod. The modder has so far focused on revamping the first couple of hours, as well as a few sections later in the game. The remainder of the game is playable, as lights were automatically placed throughout by a custom D3D9 renderer, but they are not placed in ideal locations and have not yet been adjusted to look good. Furthermore, there are other issues at the moment:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mirrors still need to be fixed</li>



<li>Portals do not animate</li>



<li>Skyboxes aren't rendering correctly</li>



<li>Only some of the Scrye reveals work </li>
</ul>



<p>If you still want to check out the mod (whose download is around <strong>10.5 GB</strong> at the moment) even at this early stage, you'll have to <strong><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/undying-renewal1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first install the Undying Renewal mod</a></strong>, which adds proper widescreen support with more resolution options (up to 4K), quality of life improvements, controller support, multiplayer support, subtitles support, restores cut content, adds a Vulkan renderer for improved performance, reduces load times, and adds a functional in-game settings menu. </p>



<p>After that mod is installed, extract the files from the "Place contents in Undying System folder" folder to the System folder of your Clive Barker's Undying installation (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System), overriding any existing files. Then, <strong>you must run the game once to ensure the RTX Remix hooks are installed</strong> (you should see a message in the top-left corner of the screen and be able to access the RTX Remix menu by pressing Alt+X). Close the game, then open the System folder location (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System) and create an 'rtx-remix' folder within it. Extract the entire 'Undying RTX Mod' folder into this 'mods' folder. To adjust the Field of View (FOV) value, you'll have to edit it directly in the User.ini file.</p>

<p>In other RTX Remix news, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-soon-add-dynamic-fx-responds-to-in-game-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled the <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong> feature at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a>. With it, modders will be able to add brand-new dynamic effects linked to specific in-game events.</p>



<p>Fans of Clive Barker's work <a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-gamescom-hands-on-preview-pleasure-and-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can look forward to the new <strong>Hellraiser: Revival</strong> game</a>, in development at <strong>Saber Interactive</strong> and scheduled for release this year.</p>
