			<p>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-series-creator-reportedly-going-to-netease-while-tencent-is-rumored-to-be-acquiring-a-japanese-studio/">left SEGA in 2021 after 32 years with the publisher</a>, and announced his new studio, Nagoshi Studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/">which he formed in partnership with NetEase a year later in 2022</a>. Now, at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, Nagoshi Studio has announced its debut project, Gang of Dragon.</p>



<p>The new action-adventure game is proof that Nagoshi made good on his promise to players in 2022, which was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-creator-promises-he-wont-make-smartphone-games-at-netease/">he wouldn't start making mobile games just because he formed his new studio under NetEase,</a> a Chinese publisher and developer known for its success in mobile and live-service titles. </p>



<p>Instead, Gang of Dragon looks to be directly in Nagoshi's wheelhouse, as the cinematic trailer reveals a tone similar to that of the Yakuza series, without necessarily having to strictly keep to the pillars of what defines those games.</p>

<p>Gang of Dragon is set in Kabukicho, Shinjuku, a nightlife district in Tokyo and stars South Korean actor Ma Dong-seok, also known as Don Lee, as the lead character and high-ranking member of a Korean crime syndicate, Shin Ji-seong.</p>



<p>You likely recognize Don Lee for his work in films like Train to Busan, Marvel's Eternals, and The Outlaws, or his recent role in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach as Samson Hook.</p>



<p>"<em>I'm both relieved and deeply focused as we finally reach the day to unveil Gang of Dragon,</em>" said Nagoshi in a press release. "<em>This project depicts, with unwavering honesty, the lives of outlaws who inhabit the real streets of Kabukicho. Through gameplay, my team and I are committed to delivering a powerful new human drama born from this world. What is shown in this teaser represents only a small part of what Gang of Dragon truly has in store, and we look forward to sharing much more with you in the future</em>."</p>



<p>There's currently no word on when to expect Gang of Dragon, or what platforms it'll arrive on beyond PC. The game is reportedly "<em>deep in development</em>," however, so now that it has been unveiled, it might become a game we see at future events throughout 2026 with a 2027 release window, but that's just a guess.</p>
