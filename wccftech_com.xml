			<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdMBChercPY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new episode</a> of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Creator's Voice interviews, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford heaped praise on the upcoming console, calling it perfect for Borderlands 4 and very powerful given the form factor.</p>
<p><em>To have Nintendo Switch 2 in hand while we're making Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 is really exciting. Usually, we'll have to port a game to a platform, but in this case, we're making Borderlands 4 for the Nintendo Switch 2. And I think that when you play Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2, you'll realize that with the cooperative experience and how we can use the Nintendo Switch 2 platform to connect with friends, share our game with friends, it's pretty astonishing how perfect this platform is for Borderlands 4. </em></p>
<p><em>The most exciting thing to me about the console is to see where we're going to go with this new connected world. Gaming is a shared social experience. It's why we, as developers, continue to make games that have adventure, but adventure with friends as well. The console makes that accessible to us as developers, to players, to our friend groups. Wherever they are in this weird, wild world, we can explore the Borderlands together.</em></p>
<p><em>The Switch 2 has been a joy to work with. It's very powerful. It's an incredible machine in a very tight form factor, and we love being on the bleeding edge with our graphics and the experience that we're creating. And the Nintendo Switch 2 makes all that possible. We don't feel like we're fighting the system. We feel like the system is enabling us and empowering us to make the best version of Borderlands 4 we can. As a game developer, it's awesome.</em></p>
<p>It's worth noting that Borderlands 4 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and has promised a large and completely seamless world with no loading between areas. That the Switch 2 can fully support such a game is certainly encouraging, though not entirely surprising after learning that games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws are also coming to the platform.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4's release date has recently been <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought forward to September 12</a>. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Nintendo console</a> will debut on the market on June 5.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-did-not-suffer-a-security-breach-and-you-dont-need-to-change-your-password-says-valve/</link>

			<p>Following reports that Steam had suffered a security breach that might affect as many as 89 million users, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/533224478739530146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has set the record straight on the matter</a>, clarifying that the leak absolutely did not breach Steam systems, and users do not need to change their passwords.</p>
<p><em>We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was NOT a breach of Steam systems. We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.</em></p>
<p><em>The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to. The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.</em></p>
<p><em>You do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event. It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We recommend regularly checking your Steam account security at any time <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this URL</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>We also recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if you haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about your account and your account’s safety.</em></p>
<p>The reports began when a hacker known as Machine1337 or EnergyWeapon started advertising the sale of user records for Valve's platforms on the dark web. They were attempting to sell the data for $5K, but according to Valve, nothing malicious could be done with them anyway.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-gets-new-screenshots-square-enix-to-share-more-when-the-time-is-right/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-hearts-iv-gets-new-screenshots-square-enix-to-share-more-when-the-time-is-right.1189776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-gets-new-screenshots-square-enix-to-share-more-when-the-time-is-right/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, during the company's quarterly financial report, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-development-3-year-reboot-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> some Kingdom Hearts news. They confirmed that development on the fourth mainline installment was going forward, but they also canceled the spin-off Missing Link, which was targeting a release on mobile devices. The reason was that they could not offer a satisfactory live service over an extended period. The game's story would have been set in the Scala ad Caelum world between the events seen in Union X and Dark Road.</p>
<p>Of course, most fans are really interested in Kingdom Hearts IV. After all, it's been over three years since <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's announcement</a>. Thankfully, earlier today, the official X account of the series <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new message and screenshots.</p>
<p><em>To our Kingdom Hearts community,</em></p>
<p><em>We’re currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game’s development. We’re dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations! We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support.</em></p>
<p>A few details of KHIV are already available. We know it's being made with Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and will be set in Quadratum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-original-sora-tokyo-no-twewy-ties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a city loosely inspired by Japan's Tokyo</a>, featuring fictional versions of Shibuya and Minami-Aoyama. Quadratum will function as the game's hub world, while Sora and his allies travel to other worlds for the missions. Story-wise, Kingdom Hearts IV will introduce the brand new 'Lost Master' story arc.</p>
<p>When it comes to gameplay, the game will bring back the reaction commands seen in KHII while also using a 'Scrap and Build' mechanic. Nomura-san and his team also plan to show off more of Sora's daily life and routines.</p>
