			<p>Ghost of Yotei will launch in early October on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, a new trailer shared today confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBLJYjSAhg&amp;t=2s">The new trailer</a>, which can be watched below, confirmed the game will launch on the current generation PlayStation consoles on October 2nd worldwide. Besides confirming the release date, the new trailer also provides a new look at the Yotei Six, gang members that Atsu has sworn to hunt down. Needless to say, the game is looking great and is a considerable step up from Ghost of Tsushima, which was originally released on PlayStation 4 and was later ported to PlayStation 5 and PC to offer improved visuals and more.</p>

			<p>New Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mods released today introduce two new full-fledged playable characters as well as new abilities for playable Sephiroth.</p>
<p>Following the video preview shared <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-playahble-characters-pc/">last week</a>, D3DNieR released today on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> a new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description">mod</a> that introduces playable versions of Reno and Rude. The two new characters, which replace Cloud and Tifa, have some small issues, but they feel like proper playable characters with some unique mechanics, such as Rude's ability to use more basic attacks after using the Unbridled Strength skill, the ability to cancel some animations by pressing the strong attack button, a counterattack, and much more.</p>
<p>While Sephiroth has been made playable past the flashback sequence at the beginning of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth already, his moveset is considerably limited compared to the other playable characters. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/980?tab=videos">The new mod</a> released by Eulymedon today, however, partially addresses this issue by introducing abilities taken from the boss version of Sephiroth, including Heartless Angel, Errant Whisper, Wicked Augment, and more. You can check how these abilities work in the video below.</p>

			<p>Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan today, suggesting that, judging from some precedents, the game may not be too far from release.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu, the second entry in the series developed by Sucker Punch received an R rating for violence, tobacco and alcohol and inappropriate language, which was predictable looking at the first entry in the series. While the rating also highlights how a launch date has not been revealed yet, we are likely going to hear more about it very soon, as not much time usually passes from the first ratings in Asian countries to the release date announcements. For Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, another big PlayStation 5 exclusive launching in 2025, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">launch date</a> was confirmed a little over a month after the game was rated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">South Korea.</a></p>

<p>We haven't seen much of Ghost of Yotei since its announcement last year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gets-new-details-from-official-website/">Back in March</a>, the game's official website confirmed some details regarding the new protagonist, Atsu, and some new gameplay mechanics, including new weapons like the odachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas, more varied environments that players will be able to take advantage of, and more.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is scheduled to release in 2025 on PlayStation 5. A PC version has yet to be officially announced, though there's little doubt that a port will be coming at some point.</p>
