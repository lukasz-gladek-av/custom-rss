			<p>Today, developer and publisher Tripwire Interactive announced that the next hotly-awaited title in the Killing Floor franchise will be delayed. Killing Floor 3 was initially set to release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-assassins-creed-shadows-split-fiction-and-killing-floor-3-in-march/">March 25</a>, but it's now been announced by Tripwire Interactive that the game will be delayed to an "undecided date" later in 2025. This <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1898029813773836551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update was posted</a> on the official Killing Floor 3 social media. For those who want to read it, the message is below.</p>
<p><em>Dear Killing Floor Fans,</em></p>
<p><em>We've made the decision to postpone killing Floor 3's launch to an undecided date later in 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>After taking the time to gather and discuss feedback from our recent closed beta, we've realized that we missed the mark. Our goal isn't just to make Killing Floor 3 an ambitious step forward for the franchise, but also to maintain the core experience that you've come to know and love.</em></p>
<p><em>With the full support of our parent company Embracer Group, we're working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel. While it's too early to say which fixes will be implemented by launch, we can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We look forward to another opportunity to show you a more polished version of Killing Floor 3, and when we're ready to share more details, you will be the first to know. Until then, we thank you for your continued patience and overwhelming support.</em></p>
<p>In addition to this statement made, there is also an FAQ for those who have pre-ordered the game and want to know what the next step is. For those who pre-ordered and are disappointed in this news, there is <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the option for a refund</a>, if you are no longer interested in receiving the game upon launch.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 is the latest title in the beloved co-op horror FPS series. This title takes place in the year 2091, which is a whopping 70 years after the events in Killing Floor 2, where the evil megacorp Horzine has now produced an even bigger, more dangerous army of bio-engineered monstrosities that are called Zeds. In this game, you take up the role of a Nightfall specialist, a rebel rogue group that is tasked with destroying the Zeds. You'll get to unlock skills, try out new weapons, and team up with up to five teammates to battle it out for survival.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 is set to release on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.</p>
