			<p>Right now, there's a big air of mystery around <strong>MachineGames</strong>, and what its next project will be. The developer is mostly known for its take on the <strong>Wolfenstein</strong> series; its last game, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></strong>, meant it took several years off from the Wolfenstein franchise to make a different kind of excellent Nazi-punching adventure.</p>



<p>But now that its treasure-hunting adventure is out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/">with its own DLC</a>, and will soon be <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-trio-of-bethesda-ports-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-fallout-4-indiana-jones-and-oblivion-remastered/">available on the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a>, the question once again becomes: what's next for MachineGames? Presumably, what's next is <strong>Wolfenstein 3</strong>, and in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, MachineGames studio director, <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong>, reiterated that, yes, MachineGames will make Wolfenstein 3 one day, even if it's not the studio's next immediate project.</p>



<p>"<em>Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein,</em>" Gustafsson says. "<em>We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. <strong>It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>It's a similar sentiment Gustafsson has shared before. Last September, as part of a NoClip documentary digging into the making of Wolfenstein, Gustafsson confirmed that the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">"<em>always seen this [Wolfenstein] as a trilogy</em>," adding that the studio has "<em>a story to tell</em>" for BJ Blazkowicz</a>.</p>



<p>And last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/">reports from Windows Central and Kotaku pointed to <strong>Wolfenstein 3 already being in development</strong></a>, though it's unclear what stage of development the game is in. Gustafsson's comments in this interview with GI.Biz are further evidence that the studio isn't done with Wolfenstein, but it does introduce the potential that the next game we see from MachineGames won't be the third entry in its mainline Wolfenstein series.</p>



<p>That said, it's still likely a game within the Wolfenstein franchise, especially if <strong>Microsoft</strong> and MachineGames want to try and line it up with the development of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein TV show currently in the works at <strong>Amazon MGM Studios</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Two years ago, a rumour appeared pointing to the studio making something that<a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-unannounced-game/"> was neither Indiana Jones nor the next entry in BJ Blazkowicz's story.</a> Its next project could be that rumoured game, if that game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-might-have-canceled-an-unannounced-project/">wasn't the same one that was reportedly cancelled last year</a></strong>. </p>



<p>Hopefully, it's not too much longer before we learn what the studio is working on, even though it currently doesn't seem like the studio will have something ready for 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-schedule-halo-summer-kiln-april-new-controller/">if the rumours around what Xbox has planned for the year are true</a>.</p>
