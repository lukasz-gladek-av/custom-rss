            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following last year's celebrations for the 50th anniversary of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D henceforth), Wizards of the Coast has slowly unveiled a bold plan in the gaming space. This coincided with a new president, John Hight, who joined the RPG, board game, and collectible card games publisher after being the 'Chief Caretaker' for World of Warcraft at Blizzard for ten years. </p>



<p>Therefore, it is perhaps not that much of a surprise to hear him speak about his desire to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG. In an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-wizards-of-the-coast-president-would-love-a-new-dungeons-dragons-mmorpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he openly admitted that he'd like to see that happen, although such a project would likely have to deviate from World of Warcraft's two-decade-old formula.</p>



<p><em>I'd love to have that. I think that we'll want to rethink what an MMO is in this day and age. I think the traditional model that Blizzard – well, even before that, Ultima Online, Everquest – pursued, that could use updating. I think in our case, it's probably a crawl, walk, run situation. We want to make sure that we've assembled the talent, we have the backend technology, we have the plans to pursue. But of course, that's a glimmer in my eye. I want to see that happen.</em></p>



<p>D&amp;D and MMORPGs are two of my favorite things in the entertainment space, so I would be lying if I didn't say how excited I am about the prospect. There are already two MMORPGs based on Wizards' IP (Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, originally released by Turbine in 2006 and now maintained by Standing Stone Games, and Neverwinter, launched by Cryptic in 2013), but they are pretty old by this point and never really got anywhere as big as the franchise deserves.</p>



<p>Still, this is not a game announcement. Hight's statement clarifies that Wizards of the Coast wants to build a tech and talent base before even attempting such a gargantuan task. Then, once the project actually gets the green light, it may take the better part of a decade before it's done, so better sit tight.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we can at least look forward to many other D&amp;D games, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>The fantasy tabletop adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, out later this year.</li>



<li>Project Baxter,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an online cooperative game in development at Starbreeze</a>&nbsp;(the makers of Payday) and scheduled to launch in 2026.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new game from Invoke</a>, formerly known as Tuque, which made the Dark Alliance game.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The recently announced action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull</a>, the studio founded by Stig Asmussen. Asmussen knew Hight from their time at Sony, before Hight's move to Blizzard, which made the partnership easier.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, the Wizards of the Coast president also announced hiring a group of former Monolith and Cliffhanger Games developers led by Michael de Plater. That announcement only mentioned this team would incubate a 'cool new game concept' without clarifying whether it would be set in the D&amp;D IP or something new. Wizards isn't putting all its gaming eggs in the same basket, either: they've also funded <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus</a>, the Mass Effect-like RPG in development at Archetype Entertainment, and a GI Joe title in the works at Atomic Arcade.</p>

			<p>Rematch, the five, four, and three-a-side arcade football game from Sifu developer Sloclap just got its third major patch today, and it's the most significant patch for the game so far, since it's the one that finally pushes crossplay support live across all platforms.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-3-1-200-300">Patch #3</a> technically first premiered on August 29, because Sloclap hosted a beta test for it for Steam players only, but as of today, September 5, it's been pushed live to all platforms, with crossplay support being its headlining feature, alongside a few major gameplay tweaks, like lowering the maximum speed at which players can lock onto volley targets while using Extra Effort by 10%.</p>



<p>Sloclap also reduced the power boost from aerial extra volley shots, two key gameplay elements that are a direct response to the current gameplay meta.</p>



<p>This patch also introduced tap direction for mouse and keyboard players, and of course, a whole bunch of bug fixes.</p>



<p>It's nice to finally see crossplay support go live, since it was a feature players expected the game to have at launch, only to feel rug-pulled by Sloclap, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">confirmed hours before the game went live that crossplay functionality wasn't ready</a>. It needed more time to get it working, and then when the game launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-update-patch-1-notes-sloclap/">a slew of other bugs that had to be squashed appeared</a>, as they usually do at game launches.</p>



<p>None of this stopped Rematch from having a massive launch, hitting <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">1 million players in its first 24 hours</a>, and reaching <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-surpasses-5-million-players-since-launch-crossplay-support-still-6-9-weeks-away/">5 million players in its first month.</a> A lot of that is thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-warcraft-remastered-little-nightmares-2-and-more-xbox-game-pass-this-month/">Xbox Game Pass</a>, but that is an undeniably large amount of players to amass for any independent developer.</p>



<p>Now that crossplay support is here, it'll be interesting to see how the game continues to grow, and how Sloclap responds to its evolving meta.</p>



<p>When I checked out Rematch for Wccftech, in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">review</a>, I noted it as "<em>an incredibly solid arcade football game, that is able to capture that feeling of getting a bunch of friends together and kicking a ball around at the local park.</em>"</p>

			<p>Starfield has already had one major DLC launch with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space</a> expansion last year, but we've known for some time that there's still more DLC to come. Though rumors have pointed to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/">arrival not coming until 2026</a>, a tease from Bethesda as part of the two-year anniversary celebrations for Starfield seems to point to the expansion potentially being revealed in 2025.</p>



<p>"<em>Celebrating two incredible years in the Starfield</em>," a post on the <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522">official X (formerly Twitter)</a> account reads. "<em>Thank you to everyone who has explored the Settled Systems with us. We look forward to the adventures yet to come</em>."</p>



<p>Besides the hint of what's "<em>yet to come</em>," the post includes a video that shows a sneak peak at what looks like the title for the second major DLC expansion for Starfield. Eagle-eyed viewers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n9cwx5/bethesda_teases_next_starfield_dlc_at_the_end_of/">Reddit</a> believe they've pieced it together, with initial speculation being that the new expansion will be called 'Terran Armada.'</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Recently, during a developer spotlight video, Tim Lamb, lead creative producer at Bethesda, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/">vaguely spoke about what Bethesda has planned for Starfield</a>, and what's coming with regard to this second major  DLC expansion.</p>



<p>"<em>We have some cool stuff coming,</em>" Lamb said. "<em>Including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story. I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the teamhas been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding</em>."</p>
