			<p>A few months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the public release of the <strong>GTA 4 RTX Remix mod</strong></a>, modder <strong>xoxor4d</strong> has now released an add-on mod that injects approximately <strong>18K PBR (physically based rendering) textures</strong>, mostly roughness/normal maps and a few height maps, into the game, further improving its visuals.</p>



<p>The modder explained that the textures were not manually created. Instead, xoxor4d used a custom build of the GTA 4 RTX Remix mod (<a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/dxvk-remix/tree/feat/AutoPBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available here</a> and called AutoPBR) to <strong>dump textures at runtime</strong> whenever they were used for rendering. The compatibility mod provided additional information about each texture via the RTX Remix API. Then, texture associations were built, and a USDA file with overwrites was generated. Further processing of the dumped textures was carried out to convert DX9 normal maps to Remix-compatible normal maps, and specular maps were converted to roughness maps using Python scripts.</p>



<p>Because of the automatic process behind the PBR conversion, the modder clarified that <strong>some textures 'here and there' might look broken</strong>. Still, in most cases, it's a noticeable improvement over the game's original textures.</p>

<p>Physically Based Rendering was not yet a thing in the games industry when <strong>Rockstar</strong> released <strong>Grand Theft Auto 4</strong> in 2008. The first games to use PBR were launched in 2013: <strong>Dontnod</strong>'s sci-fi action game <strong>Remember Me</strong> (made in Unreal Engine 3), <strong>Crytek</strong>'s <strong>Ryse: Son of Rome</strong> (made in CryEngine), and <strong>Guerrilla</strong>'s <strong>Killzone: Shadow Fall</strong> (made in Decima Engine). The big difference is that, with PBR, <strong>materials respond realistically to lighting.</strong> </p>



<p>This is all the more important for the GTA 4 RTX Remix mod, which <strong>enables path tracing and thus benefits immensely from PBR textures</strong>. Of course, it's not quite the same thing as if a Rockstar artist had handcrafted them.</p>



<p>In other RTX Remix news, NVIDIA <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-out-now-dynamic-fx-classic-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released the new Logic system yesterday</a></strong>. Modders can now add dynamic visual effects to their mods that are triggered based on in-game events. We'll see if xoxor4d decides to introduce it to this GTA 4 RTX Remix mod.</p>

			<p>Despite a rather <strong>successful launch</strong> last year, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> hasn't been as big a success as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong><em>Monster Hunter World</em> </strong></a>and<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a></em>. The <strong>low challenge level and massive performance issues</strong> across all formats prevented the game from capitalizing on its <strong>launch momentum</strong>, with sales dwindling so much that it became <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-pretty-damning-lapsed-players-may-not-be-coming-back-to-monster-hunter-wilds-after-all-as-monster-hunter-rise-continues-to-outsell-the-game/">CAPCOM's worst-selling game</a></strong> in the past few months, soundly outsold by games that had been on the market much longer.</p>



<p>While the <span><strong>low-challenge issues were fixed last year</strong>&nbsp;with Title Updat</span>ed, introducing new&nbsp;<strong>challenging monsters&nbsp;</strong>and more&nbsp;<strong>powerful variants</strong>&nbsp;of already available ones, the <strong>performance issues weren't</strong>. December's update was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/">a small step in the right direction</a></strong>, but all eyes were on the<strong> January PC performance update</strong>, which promised to deliver the<strong> performance improvements the game desperately needed.</strong></p>



<p>And, against all odds, the new Monster Hunter Wilds patch <strong>delivered its promises</strong>, significantly<strong> improving performance</strong> on various PC configurations and even on the Steam Deck.</p>



<p>The <strong>1.040.03.01 PC performance patch</strong> went live earlier today, alongside the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?snr=1_5_9_"><strong>official patch notes</strong></a> outlining some of the changes, which include:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Improved CPU/GPU processing specific to the Steam version.</em></li>



<li><em>Reduced shader warming processes performed outside the shader compilation screen to lower CPU load.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted texture streaming to improve visual quality while reducing VRAM usage.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted the High Resolution Texture Pack to reduce VRAM usage and overall package size.</em></li>



<li><em>Added a CPU tab to the Options menu, allowing players to adjust settings related to CPU load.</em></li>



<li><em>Added new categories to the graphics settings, along with new settings for existing options.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted graphic presets and added a confirmation window to automatically update your settings on first launch after updating.</em></li>



<li><em>Expanded the Volumetric Fog setting in the graphics options from two levels to five. The previous "High" setting has been renamed to "Highest," and "Low" to "High," with three new lower options—"Medium," "Low," and "Lowest"—now available.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where a warning dialogue incorrectly indicated that the AMD Radeon driver was outdated when using driver version 26.1.1 or later.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>On paper, these changes sound <strong>promising</strong>, but do they actually improve performance? It seems <strong>they do</strong>, looking at online reports. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Game doesn't stutter with highest textures anymore, very good,"</em> reported <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-released-ver-1-040-03-01.1418182/post-150606088"><strong>moqz on the ResetERA forums</strong></a>. While the user reports that on an RTX 4070 Ti at 4K resolution and NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode, the framerate still drops below 60 FPS in certain areas, it seems to be <strong>generally more stable.</strong></p>



<p><em>"Significant uplift. I have a 4070 Ti Super and I'm currently running with everything cranked (including the high res texture pack), DLAA and 2X framegen. 100-120 fps. </em><span><em>Image quality also feels sharper,"</em>&nbsp;said another ResetERA user, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-released-ver-1-040-03-01.1418182/post-150606220"><strong>jrx8080</strong></a>, who's running the game on an RTX 4070 Ti GPU at max set</span>tings, DLAA, and 2X Frame Generation, hitting 100-120 FPS, though the user didn't specify at which resolution.</p>



<p>The first <strong>comparison videos</strong> shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VideoGamePerformance"><strong>Video Game Performance</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Pandapa"><strong>Pandapa</strong></a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@WreckitRai"><strong>WreckitRai</strong> </a>offer a clearer view of what the patch does. While the average framerate isn't significantly higher than the previous version of the game, <strong>frametimes are far more stable</strong>, which contributes to the game feeling generally smoother than before.</p>

<p>The new Monster Hunter Wilds patch also brought significant performance improvements on <strong>Steam Deck</strong>. A new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard"><strong>Deck Wizard</strong></a> shows the game running on Valve's system with the patch, <strong>hitting a relatively stable 30 FPS at low settings</strong>, finally making the game somewhat playable on it. </p>



<p>As more performance improvements are expected to come next month, on February 18th, things are definitely looking up for those who wish to play the game on the go and don't want to wait for the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/potato-mode-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-the-communitys-reaction-doesnt-disappoint/">inevitable Nintendo Switch 2 port</a></strong>, which is all but <a href="https://wccftech.com/think-monster-hunter-wilds-on-nintendo-switch-2-will-be-an-impossible-port-new-screenshot-and-information-suggest-otherwise/"><strong>confirmed to be in the works.</strong></a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides introducing these performance fixes, the new Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance patch also addresses the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/">DLC checks issue that came to light earlier this month</a></strong> and impacted <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-can-reportedly-double-removing-dlc-check/"><strong>performance in the Base Camp and Grand Hub.</strong></a></p>



<p>With a lot more online reports mentioning performance improvements with this new Monster Hunter Wilds patch, it feels like the game may finally be in the perfect spot to <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>bring players back </strong></a><strong>ahead</strong> of the yet-to-be-revealed Master Rank expansion. Hopefully, it will build on the solid game mechanics of the base game to deliver the definitive Monster Hunter experience it has always had the potential to be, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>in my opinion.</strong></a></p>
