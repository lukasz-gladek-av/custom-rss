			<p>This year has been a horrible one for people in the games industry, as there has been nonstop layoffs across the board. From big companies to indie developers, it doesn't seem like anyone has been spared from it. It's been announced that Deck Nine, the developers behind recently released title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> has laid off more staff. This isn't even the first time this year for Deck Nine, as they experienced layoffs earlier in the year, too.</p>
<p>A statement was shared on the<a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Deck Nine X page</a>, where a statement was made by Mark Lyons, the CEO of the company. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members. This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion, and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.<br>
To those of you leaving the studio to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can.<br>
To the community, we ask for your support and understanding during this difficult time."</p>
<p>At the moment, the reason behind the layoffs hasn't been stated, but it is possible that it's due to the fact that Life is Strange: Double Exposure didn't perform to their expectations, as a lot of people were disappointed with the narrative and especially the ending of the game.</p>
<p>The gaming industry has seen more than 14,600 confirmed jobs lost across 175+ companies in 2024. The most recent layoffs that we saw confirmed were layoffs at Ubisoft that happened earlier in the week, where nearly 300 people have been confirmed to be laid off at the company due to studios within Ubisoft being shut down due to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/"> XDefiant officially closing down next year</a>. They are also due to experience more layoffs in February, most likely related to the closure of the studios.</p>
<p>It's not been clarified how many people have been laid off at Deck Nine Games, with their number of staff already being relatively small. In February, they laid off roughly 20% of their staff. Combining that with this new layoff, it's hard to know how many staff members will be left at the company.</p>

			<p>The Early Access period of Path of Exile 2 was due to start earlier today, but due to some internal issues, no one has been able to access the game yet. It was originally scheduled to launch at 2 PM EST / 11 AM PST, but the developer, Grinding Gear Games, decided to do some last-minute database upgrades, as there were a ton more players eagerly queued up to play the game, and they didn't expect as many as there were. So, they did the database upgrades to try and be able to handle the influx of players. However, the upgrades didn't go as planned, with the team working on the database saying that it would only take a "half-hour" to get access to Path of Exile 2. However, that wasn't the case.</p>
<p>As they were trying to upgrade the database, they found another issue within the game. It started with a crash that "would have affected a majority of users," which was promptly fixed, with the developers saying that the game was ready to be deployed and that the Early Access release was "relatively imminent." However, it was not to be, as the team ran into yet another issue with configuration, and said that they needed to restart the realm. All of this is being updated on<a href="https://x.com/pathofexile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> their social media</a>, where they are giving those who are interested a play-by-play on how they are running into issues and what they are doing to resolve them.</p>
<p>While they did manage to fix that issue, they said that the ran into the same symptom again, but with a different problem, where multiple characters had the same character ID. They have followed up by saying:</p>
<p>"We've run into the same symptom again with a different problem. We are working on fixing it again but regrettably every time this happens we have to restart and wipe the databases to prevent them getting into bad or corrupted states. We'll have a fix out as soon as we can!"</p>
<p>They have assured the audience that they will be kept updated during this time, as they have a rocky Early Access launch ahead of them. However, it's already more popular than World of Warcraft and New World on Twitch and is <a href="https://x.com/nugiyen/status/1865125378781569460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently more popular than Diablo IV</a> in terms of live viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to the live servers of the game being down, the official Path of Exile 2 website is also down, with the website just taking you to a blank page that says "temporarily unavailable..."</p>
<p>We will continue to update you as there are changes and fixes made by the developers who are hard at work.</p>

			<p>Xbox Game Pass already had a ton of brilliant games to get stuck into, and it's now been announced by Crytek that Hunt: Showdown 1896 will also be joining <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-launches-on-game-pass-tomorrow/">the roster of games</a> available to play. For those who are subscribers, you'll be able to play Hunt: Showdown 1896 from 12 December 2024. This is only a couple of days away. On the same day the game is coming to Xbox Game Pass, Post Malone's collaboration with the game will be arriving, called Post Malone's Murder Circus. You can watch a trailer for his event below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Post Malone's Murder Circus Trailer | #HuntPartner | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ooh5BxMHwhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those interested in taking part in Post Malone's event in-game, it will be running from December 12 through February 10, 2025. The event will transport you to a different place in time where you will get to experience a supernatural carnival that makes its mark on the bayou, gulch, and more. At the circus, you'll find Post Malone, the Deposed King and former Ringmaster, who leads you through the horrifying show. The circus is corrupted by the cursed HelioStone, which is a supernatural artifact, bringing horrifying threats to the game in areas like the bayou and the Mammon's Gulch.</p>
<p>This event will introduce new horrifying creatures, such as the Ursa Mortis, which is a strong, two-headed bear. Along with them, you'll see plenty of Circus Grunts floating about, especially while you're inside the Circus compound. To be able to combat these new enemies, you'll be given weapons like the Shredder, which fires sawblades, and Chu Ko Nu, a repeating crossbow.</p>
<p>That's not the only thing added to be able to survive the circus, as you'll also be given the chance to use new weapon variants, such as the 1865 Carbine Aperture, Krag Silencer, Maynard Sniper Silencer, and Sparks Pistol Silencer. This update is a pretty big one, as there is new equipment to use, such as the Recovery Shot consumable and Subsonic Ammo type.</p>
<p>New content isn't the only thing coming to Hunt: Showdown 1896 with this update, as they have also added enhanced silencer mechanics, tweaks to animations, bug fixes and quality-of-life changes to make the game enjoyable for new and returning players of the game.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Post Malone's update, you can check out the <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/post-malone-s-murder-circus-coming-to-hunt-showdown-1896-on-dec-12th" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, which has all of the details for the horrifying circus event, as well as the gory details about what you can expect to contend with while you're there.</p>
<p>This update will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
