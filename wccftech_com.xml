			<p>Today, Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive) announced that Battlefield 6 Season 1 will begin on October 28 and feature free new content for all players.</p>



<p>The first season kicks off with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map called Blackwell Fields, a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint, and new weapons. The second phase, California Resistance, begins on November 18 and includes a map located in Southern California called Eastwood, as well as a Sabotage mode designed for 8v8 combat. The final phase of Season 1, Winter Offensive, begins on December 9 and includes a seasonal map update to Empire State and a themed event.</p>



<p>Blackwell Fields' map includes support for all combat sizes, land, and air vehicles. The backstory is that, right after the end of the single player campaign of Battlefield 6, double agents from the antagonist faction Pax Armata launch a series of attacks on NATO targets, starting at a recently recommissioned American air base in the California badlands. The new Strikepoint mode is an intense, small-team tactical mode in which a squad fights another squad over multiple rounds to capture a key objective. Each round, players have only one life.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase one's additions also include:</p>



<ul>
<li>APC Traverser Mark 2 - A land vehicle that suits four players: one driver, one roof gunner, and two side gunners. </li>



<li>SOR-300C - A low rate of fire carbine rifle chambered in the higher damage .300 Blackout ammunition compared to the platform’s 5.56 version.</li>



<li>Mini Fix - A lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle</li>



<li>GGH-22 - A high-capacity and fire rate sidearm</li>



<li>Rail Cover &amp; LPVO - Attachments for rifles and LMGs</li>
</ul>



<p>The Eastwood map will support all Battlefield 6 combat sizes, land vehicles, and helicopters. The setting is described as a sleepy, affluent suburb connected to a golf course. In Sabotage mode, players must destroy as many sites as possible before time runs out. Each team has one offensive and one defensive round; ultimately, the team that successfully detonates the most sites wins the match.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase 2 will introduce the Battle Pickups feature to the game. These are high-tech, powerful weapons that are limited in ammo and availability throughout a given map. Players will have to scour the maps to find where they're located if they want to exploit the advantage they bring. Other additions include:</p>



<ul>
<li>DB-12 - A dual-barrel pump-action shotgun</li>



<li>M327 Trait - High-damage (but low rate of fire) sidearm with eight rounds. This revolver is powerful in close quarters but has a significant damage drop-off compared to its .44 Magnum comrade.</li>



<li>Troy Angled - This grip attachment offers an alternative for underbarrel choices</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, in the final phase of Battlefield 6 Season 1, Winter Offensive, players will see a seasonal visual update to the Empire State map, where temperatures are now freezing. To go with that theme, there's also a limited-time Ice Lock event centered around a mechanic called Freeze (though this will only be active in specific experiences). Finally, a new melee tool, the Ice Climbing Axe, will be introduced to the shooter game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fallout: London is an incredibly expansive mod for Fallout 4 that takes Bethesda's post-nuclear apocalypse across the pond to the United Kingdom, completely overhauling the game for what's essentially an entirely new Fallout 4 experience. It's arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/">one of the more popular mods available for the nearly decade-old game</a>, and Team FOLON has just unveiled and released the first major DLC for Fallout: London titled Rabbit &amp; Pork.</p>



<p>Rabbit &amp; Pork adds a bevy of new content for players to dig through, including more than 8,000 new lines of dialogue from 80 new fully-voiced NPCs, 30 new quests, weapons, armours, and mini-games, including a new Blackjack minigame. 70 new random encounters, a new companion and a new home, and along with the new content, the update brings about 1,400 bug fixes.</p>



<p>Even beyond the content and bug fixes, today's news update adds another quality-of-life update that players might appreciate even more: a <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher">new custom launcher for Fallout: London powered by Overwolf</a>, which Team FOLON describes as "<em>a one-click solution to install and update the mod seamlessly.</em>"</p>

<p>"<em>Rabbit &amp; Pork represents the next iteration of Fallout: London,</em>" says Team FOLON chief executive officer, Dean Carter, in a press release. "<em>It's the most complete and stable version yet, with brand-new storylines and characters that push our vision even further. Working with Overwolf to launch the custom installer makes this experience more accessible than ever, removing barriers so fans can dive straight into London</em>."</p>



<p>Overwolf chief executive officer Uri Marchand added, "<em>The sheer talent and dedication of Team FOLON is proof that in-game creators are shaping the future of gaming. Projects like Fallout: London show how UGC can extend the shelf life of the world's most beloved games, bringing fresh lore, worlds, and characters long after launch. Overwolf's mission is to empower these visionary creators, and we're proud to help bring their work to millions of players with our easy-to-access launcher</em>."</p>



<p>Fallout: London's Rabbit &amp; Pork DLC is available to download for players right now.</p>

			<p>Michael '<a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/pachter-nintendos-a-bad-company-with-iwata-a-poor-ceo/">Nintendo is a bad company</a>' Pachter, also known as Michael '<a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2022/03/10/michael-pachter-on-ps5-vs-xbox-series-x/">PlayStation is doomed</a>' Pachter, and sometimes known as Michael Pachter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-24/this-netflix-analyst-has-cost-investors-a-2-000-return">the analyst who cost investors a 2,000% return when he advised them to sell their Netflix stock</a>, is back to an old stomping ground with a new claim that "<em>Sony is blowing it in the games business,</em>" because he predicts that games will move to cloud-based experiences connected to your TVs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CktSxc9_4uk&amp;t=706s">Yahoo Finance</a> discussion (spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/michael-pachter-sony-is-a-terrible-company-they-are-blowing-it-in-the-games-business-games-are-moving-to-connected-tv-via-the-cloud.1312330/">ResetEra</a>) about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">EA going private through its $55 billion sale</a> and where people should place their stock market bets in the videogame industry, when asked if people should be buying Sony stock, Pachter immediately responded, "<em>No, Sony for sure not, Sony is a terrible company, and they actually are blowing it in the games business.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Look, games are moving to connected TV,</em>" he continues. "<em>So, think about all the participants that are going to deliver games the way we get movies via Netflix, and forget the subscription model. Just think about iOS becoming on your TV. So free-to-play games on your TV, who's going to deliver that? Cloud providers, AI, anybody whose investing in making that happen is where you want to be.</em>"</p>



<p>Pachter continued to comment that if people looking to invest in the videogame industry want to invest in any current publishers, they should look towards <a href="https://www.playtika.com/">PlayTika, a mobile game company</a> that Pachter owns 500,000 shares of. Pachter added that it is currently trading at "<em>about a four and a half multiple</em>" and that if it were to get an EA-level multiple, he would make "<em>several million dollars</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Electronic Arts: Breaking down the $55 billion deal that takes the company private" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CktSxc9_4uk?start=706&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This isn't the first time Pachter has bet on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-losing-to-sony-is-a-wrong-gamers-perception-says-pachter-they-want-to-win-business-not-console/">cloud and non-console-based experiences</a> in videogames being the future. He also previously claimed that Microsoft adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/">Activision titles to Xbox Game Pass would bring the service 100 million subscribers</a>, and claimed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-will-get-to-200-million-subs-in-10-years-bets-michael-pachter-exclusivity-model-is-wrong/">in the next decade, Game Pass will have 200 million subscribers</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, Pachter has made a career out of these kinds of wild claims and <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/michael-pachter">has been wrong more often than he's been right</a>. It's worth wondering when we can start considering Pachter just an old man shouting at clouds. Or, more accurately, about clouds.</p>



<p>Just days ago, Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino called the PS5 Sony's "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-ps5-is-the-most-successful-playstation-generation-ever-making-136-billion-in-sales-so-far">most successful generation to date</a></em>," with $136 billion in sales generated.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-day-one-patch-ray-tracing-improvements/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-day-one-patch-introduces-ray-tracing-performance-improvements-and-more.1312552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day-one patch introduces plenty of improvements to the game, including ray tracing and performance improvements.</p>



<p>As confirmed to <a href="http://ign.com/">IGN</a>, the 1.006 patch will be live by the time the game officially launches on October 2, and it is a highly recommended download for those who are going to play the game with a retail copy, as it will introduce some critical improvements. Chief among them will be multiple improvements to environmental rendering performance, fixes for Ray Tracing Mode to ensure lighting consistency and performance, and various performance improvements in missions with high character counts.</p>



<p>The Ghost of Yōtei day one patch doesn't stop at improving just performance and stability. It is also packed with gameplay fixes, animation improvements, significant environment enhancements, and interface fixes. The full details on every improvement and fix can be found in the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-details-ghost-of-yotei-day-one-patch-notes-includes-an-extensive-list-of-improvements"> full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>Although improvements are always welcome, Ghost of Yōtei was not in dire need of them, as the game looked and played great even without the day-one patch, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">highlighted by Alessio in his review</a>. The game's only major issue, which no patch can fix, is its extreme similarity to the first entry in the series, although it is one that is easy to look past, considering its quality.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei launches worldwide on PlayStation 5 on October 2. If its predecessor is anything to go by, the game is also expected to release on PC in the future</p>
