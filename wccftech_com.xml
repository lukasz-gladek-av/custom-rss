			<p>The Death Stranding 2: On the Beach release date announcement should be imminent, as information about the game's physical editions, including a pricey Collector's Edition, started surfacing online ahead of pre-orders opening.</p>
<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun revealed in a new<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> report</a> that information about the game's physical editions have started surfacing, suggesting that pre-orders are about to begin, and thus a release date announcement is imminent. Besides a standard edition, which will launch for â‚¬79.99 and $69.99, a Collector's Edition will also launch in North America and Europe for the price of $299.99 in the United States. The contents of the Collector's Edition are still unknown at the time.</p>
<p>As the insider estimates pre-orders for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will begin before the end of the month, there's a very good chance that the game's release date will be revealed during this week's special panel at SXSW 2025, which will feature not only Hideo Kojima but also Norman Reedus and Troy Baker who play main character Sam Porter Bridges and villain Higgs, respectively.</p>
<p>Likely being a few months away from the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on PlayStation 5, this would be the perfect time to revisit the first entry in the series and get reacquainted with the series' universe.
