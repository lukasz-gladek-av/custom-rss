            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Before Arkane Austin made its Prey game, a developer called <a href="https://wccftech.com/human-head-rune-ragnarok-interview/">Human Head Studios</a> created and developed Prey as a first-person shooter centered around a Cherokee named Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi, who ventures on a quest to save his grandfather and his girlfriend after they're taken by an alien spaceship currently in orbit around the Earth. It was released on PC and Xbox 360, and a sequel was in development until the game was cancelled in 2014.</p>



<p>Between 2006 and 2014, the rights for Human Head Studios' Prey went from its 3D Realms, who initially helped publish the game, to a different company called Radar Group, to ZeniMax Media, who modern players will recognize today as a Bethesda and ZeniMax company, and overall a subsidiary of Microsoft and Xbox. It was under ZeniMax, unfortunately, where Prey 2, which had bounced around in development limbo for years, was canceled, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rune-developer-human-head-studios-closes-down-and-reopens-as-roundhouse-studios-at-bethesda/">Human Head Studios was officially shuttered</a> and subsumed into Bethesda as Roundhouse Studios in 2019.</p>



<p>Now, more than a decade after Prey 2 was cancelled and a little under a decade since Arkane Austin made its entirely separate but similarly titled Prey, gameplay footage for Human Head Studios' Prey 2 has leaked online.</p>



<p>A post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zcc8/prey_2_development_videos_leaked/">Reddit</a> includes links for what would have been Prey 2's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vbwq7X3G8">opening</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSNdZBLCvog">gameplay demo</a> that might've appeared at an E3 show, and a couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDwfoEv20iE">earlier development</a> clips of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoYaYVPY5WA">gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7OIifeZ-s">combat</a>, all uploaded by a YouTube channel under the name '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.'</p>



<p>The footage is incomplete, but it does give fans of the 2006 Prey a sense of what the team was striving for in a sequel, hoping to take the core elements of Human Head's first Prey game and evolve on them.</p>



<p>At the time of Human Head Studios' shuttering, co-founder Chris Rhinehart said, "<em>Sadly, we had to wind down the business of Human Head Studios and close its doors, which was particularly devastating due to the passion and creativity of the team we’d assembled</em>."</p>



<p>The video game industry wasn't in such dire straits in 2019 compared to its current state, so thankfully, at the time, the whole team was able to stay together and were given new jobs at the aforementioned Roundhouse Studios, which was formed under Bethesda as a way to keep Human Head together. Though it only bought them a few more years, since the mass layoffs since then, not to mention the latest round of mass layoffs that saw significant cuts to <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online</a>, likely split the team up for good. </p>

			<p>Following the release of several <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/">horror games</a> to a reception ranging from positive to mildly negative, sometimes due to how particular sensitive themes were addressed, Polish developer Bloober Team has risen considerably in the estimation of survival horror fans for the excellent work the studio has done with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, a faithful adaptation of the classic Konami game enhanced by some modern features that make it a joy to play. While the Polish studio is set to continue this fruitful collaboration with the development of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/"> remake of the first entry in the series</a>, Bloober Team is also expanding its own properties with new titles, the first of them being Cronos: The New Dawn. Right from the game's reveal, it was made clear how this game would be a threshold release for the studio, moving past the narrative-focused experiences such as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/"> Layers of Fear series</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> to delve deeper into the survival horror genre. And while it is definitely a little flawed, there's no denying that Bloober Team created a solid game that becomes rather engaging once things really get going.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The true mission of The Travel and the real purpose of The Collective are among the mysteries hidden in Cronos: The New Dawn</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is set in a twisted reimagining of Krakow's Nowa Huta district, one of the city's districts built as a utopian ideal city meant to mirror European capitals like London and Paris. Instead of exploring the grandeur of the most populous district in Krakow, players will get to explore a ruined version of the district, its population completely decimated by a terrible plague known only as The Change, which turns human beings into horrible, mutated monstrosities known as The Orphans. Despite the current situation, humanity doesn't seem to have been left to its doomed fate, as a mysterious organization known as The Collective is sending individuals wearing massive protective armor to investigate The Change and fight off any monsters on their path. After many of these individuals have died on the path to truth, it will be up to a new Traveler to retrace their steps and rescue certain individuals from the 1980s via time rift before they succumb to the Change. After meeting The Warden, another armored individual tasked with providing members of The Collective with the tools needed to survive New Dawn, however, it starts becoming clear how there's a lot more behind The Change, the recovery of individuals from the past, and the purpose of The Collective.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn's setting and story are undoubtedly some of the best features in the game. The Polish setting is rather unique for video games, and the game's time-travel gimmick allowed for the creation of dual worlds, which are incredibly interesting to explore, although the almost constant nighttime doesn't provide a lot of visual differences between the two. With environmental storytelling in the vein of the Souls series, and scattered documents in the vein of classic survival horror games, piecing together the story and the events that happened before and during the outbreak of The Change is also quite engaging, although the game does feature plenty of cutscenes that provide clarity on some of these events and make it easy to follow the plot at its base level. With some difficult choices to make at times as well, Cronos: The New Dawn does an excellent job immersing players into the role of The Traveler, making them hunger for the next big reveal.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn's story is engaging and immersive right from the very beginning.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Having a great story that's gripping right from the start is generally good for any game, but in the case of Cronos: The New Dawn, it's even better for a particular reason: the first few hours of the game do a terrible job introducing the experience, so much so that I expect some will drop the game entirely before things start getting good. This is caused mainly by what immediately feels like a by-the-books survival horror experience clearly inspired by the Dead Space series, only with a really unremarkable enemy design, both in terms of combat and visual design, and a considerably worse combat system with no dismemberment mechanics that requires some time and resource investment in weapon upgrades to become fun. Exploration and traversal fare a little better thanks to an intricate level design, and the lack of an in-game map, which enhances immersion considerably while forcing players to rely on the environment's visual elements to find their way (although there's an optional waymarker system that guides players to their next objective).</p>



<p>Though exploration and traversal improve fairly quickly with the introduction not only of optional locations filled with much-needed resources like Energy, materials to craft items, and spare ammo as well as documents and Travelogs that provide additional information on the setting and story, but also of the Anomaly mechanics, which can be used to alter the environment by manipulating time, representing a unique way to provide additional puzzles alongside those of the more traditional variety, like locked doors and passwords to find, combat does not. </p>



<p>With their hulking armor, The Traveler is really slow and has no real defensive option, not even the ability to turn 180 degrees when needed, so proper positioning and headshots with the handgun, whose shots can be charged for extra damage, are the only things that separate The Traveler from an early death at the start of the game. With enemies not reacting a lot to shots, combat feels unsatisfying in the first few hours, dragging the entire experience down. Even after introducing the Orphans' ability to consume their dead to power up, requiring The Traveler to burn their bodies using the Shell Suit's flamethrower, things don't improve. In its basic form, the handgun is a really weak weapon, and with ammo being so scarce, every combat encounter becomes a stressful exercise where luck seems to play a bigger role than skill. Ending up with no ammo in a forced combat encounter, with no weapon to rely on other than the weak melee attacks, including a stomp that looks more powerful than it actually is, is a frustrating experience that I expect will make a few players simply give up on the game.</p>



<p>My frustration with the Cronos: The New Dawn's combat system reached its peak right before the game's first boss battle against a massive Orphan set in a small location with several rooms whose design provides the cover needed to shoot the canisters scattered around to stagger the enemy and reveal its weak points. It's during this battle, or rather after a few failed attempts, that I started appreciating what the game tries to do with its combat mechanics. Upgrading the handgun and the shotgun, deciding on the fly how to use the resources in my possesion to craft either ammo or healing items, which can be easily done without opening the menu by holding either the directional shortcut to which a weapon is assigned or the healing button, picking up some resources on the combat grounds to allow for emergency crafting, finally clicked together, completely changing my perspective on the game. </p>



<p>After obtaining the first Essence, the soul of one individual related to The Change outbreak, and enjoying a welcome passive bonus, and meeting The Warden, ammo started becoming available in bigger quantities, making it much easier to handle Orphans and manage resources, which continue to be scarce, but not as scarce as they are in the first couple of hours, although that wasn't the end of the frustration, as there still some forced enemy encounters on the way that were, sometimes, a little too challenging with the available resources.</p>



<p>As The Traveler's mission proceeds, more combat and exploration tools are unlocked, including small explosive bombs called Pyre and anti-gravitational boots that further enhance the experience a lot, so much so that I had a difficult time putting the game down. Granted, some flaws remain evident, such as the average enemy visual design, which makes it almost hard to tell one enemy type apart from another, and the generally predictable survival-horror experience, but how every gameplay element comes together in the end made it easy for me to look past most of these issues, ultimately making making me appreciate some of the game's unique quirks even more, including managing how to burn the bodies of dead Orphans to prevent a powerful enemy from becoming even more powerful, while making me forget the frustrating first couple of hours.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn takes a few hours to get going, but when it does, the experience becomes quite engaging.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Enhancing the Cronos: The New Dawn experience are the game's visuals, powered by Unreal Engine 5. While the game eventually becomes a little predictable in terms of visual design, as already mentioned, it's difficult not to notice how the good usage of lighting and volumetrics enhances the entire experience, even without hardware ray tracing. The solid visual design of New Dawn, which gives it a distinct industrial vibe, is accompanied by great texture and character models work, except for the aforementioned enemy design, which looks rather generic, and some evident asset recycling from the Silent Hill 2 remake, as the hair of one character makes really evident.</p>



<p>Being powered by Unreal Engine 5, however, some stuttering issues were expected on PC, and they sadly are in. Though the game has a shader precompilation step, which reduces shader stuttering issues, the game clearly suffers from traversal stuttering issues that, while not frequent, are easily noticeable and immersion-breaking. Given the game's visuals which rely a lot on lighting, enabling hardware ray tracing hits performance considerably, as the game ran at an average of 55 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS in Balanced Mode without Frame Generation at the high Quality Preset at 4K resolution traveling around The Terminal, which serves as some sort of main hub, on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM). At the same settings, enabling Frame Generation (and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 users</a>) boosts performance in the same area at an average of around 80 FPS, so using frame gen tech will be the way to go for the vast majority of players who want to experience the game with ray tracing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cronos: The New Dawn 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Balanced, Ray Tracing, Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cubXYGJWR1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Disabling ray tracing greatly improves performance, as the game ran at close to the 100 FPS mark in the same scenario without it. Sadly, there aren't a lot of graphics settings to tweak outside of a comprehensive Quality Preset and a few others that have minimal impact on performance, like motion blur, so upscalers (TSR, DLSS, FSR 3.1, and XeSS) and frame generation are the only features that can help the user achieve the desired level of performance in the game. Though lacking in graphics options, Cronos: The New Dawn comes with others that should be the standard for PC games but often aren't, including rebindable controls, ultrawide resolution support, and a wealth of accessibility features such as multiple Color Blind modes, quick-time event settings, and more.</p>

<p>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/02/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-1/">announced</a> the first batch of games coming to Xbox Game Pass in September 2025, with two of the six games overshadowing the rest despite both being indie titles, as I Am Your Beast and Hollow Knight Silksong enter the subscription service.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/">I Am Your Beast</a>, you might recall, is developer Strange Scaffold's fast-paced, first-person, parkour-shooter, as you run around individual levels eliminating everyone in your path while going for the fastest times. It was one of 2024's better indie titles from the same studio that released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546310/El_Paso_Elsewhere/">El Paso, Elsewhere</a>, the year before, which is also being made into a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://deadline.com/2024/04/el-paso-elsewhere-movie-starring-lakeith-stanfield-in-works-1235890630/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9p7T-0LyPAxVSDzQIHZXxImEQFnoECB4QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zCdyhWx36_ex6-sLdn0zd">feature film</a>.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong needs no introduction at this point, with its inclusion in Xbox Game Pass being significant if you want to avoid paying its <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-launch-19-99/">$19.99 price tag</a>. That might seem like a small price to pay for what has been heralded as one of the most anticipated indie titles in the last decade, but it follows the same model Team Cherry used with Hollow Knight, which has mostly stayed at $14.99 since it launched in 2017.</p>

<p>The rest of the games entering Xbox's subscription service this week and the first half of this month include Saber Interactive's RoadCraft, RedCandleGames' Nine Sols, a game you could argue is heavily inspired by Hollow Knight. Strategy and city-builder Cataclismo, and PAW Patrol World.</p>



<ul>
<li>I Am Your Beast - Xbox Series X/S, PC, Cloud - available September 2</li>



<li>Nine Sols - Xbox Series X/S - available September 3</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong - Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Cloud - September 4</li>



<li>Cataclismo - PC - available September 4</li>



<li>PAW Patrol World - Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Cloud - available September 10</li>



<li>RoadCraft - Xbox Series X/S, Cloud - available September 16</li>
</ul>



<p>As with every month, with games entering the subscription service, there are games leaving. As of September 15, the following three games will no longer be available in Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<ul>
<li>All You Need is Help</li>



<li>Wargroove 2</li>



<li>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With Octopath Traveler 2 having been released in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/">2023</a>, I did not expect to see a new entry in the series that made HD-2D popular anytime soon. <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">Back in July</a>, however, Square Enix surprised fans of the series worldwide with the announcement of Octopath Traveler 0, a new game which isn't a proper sequel to its predecessors, but a sort of new and improved take on the story elements and gameplay ideas seen in the mobile game Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent as well as some brand new gameplay mechanics, such as town building mechanics that will allow players to rebuild their hometowns and customize it with a ton of visual customization options.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last month, I was given the chance to try out Octopath Traveler 0 before its release later this year, getting a taste of both the town building mechanics and the gameplay loop, which doesn't seem to stray too far from the classic JRPG loop featured in the first two entries in the series. Unfortunately, a total of around one hour wasn't enough to appreciate the finer details of the experience, and the few minutes I spent rebuilding the town weren't particularly impressive, as, aside from placing some buildings here and there, I couldn't experience how much choices would impact the development of the town and its inhabitants, although things seemed promising enough.</p>

<p>The second half of the Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom 2025 demo, on the other hand, felt way more familiar and engaging. Set during one of the early story chapters, I was able to explore a beautiful and lively HD-2D town, interact with NPCs using the series' trademark Path Actions, which can have widely different outcomes depending on a variety of factors, and eventually proceed to a dungeon whose design is in line with the design of dungeons of the previous two entries in the series - a few alternate paths, but a generally straightforward design that easily prevents players from getting lost. As I explored the dungeon, I got into quite a few battles which felt instantly familiar, as the turn-based combat system of new entry in the series hasn't been changed a whole lot. As such, before long, I started hitting enemy weakpoints to Break and stun them, and Boost my characters to enhance the power of their skills to get rid of them in a single turn. The biggest change to the Octopath Traveler 0 combat experience is the bigger party size, eight members instead of four positioned in a front and back row, which I expect will open up a lot of interesting strategies and that is sure to influence enemy design considerably, since it will be easy to hit an enemy weakness with so many characters on hand. Having so many characters and widely diverse skills at my disposal, however, did not make the boss battle awaiting at the end of the dungeon any easier, so even those who mastered the previous two entries in the series should find plenty to sink their teeth into.</p>



<p>Thrown into the middle of the adventure with little to no knowledge of skills and synergies for eight different characters, playing the Octopath Traveler 0 Gamescom 2025 demo felt overwhelming, at times, but as soon as I got a little more acquainted with them, I was hooked once again. With the game's Job system promising to deliver the usual excellent customization features the series is known for, and plenty of unknowns regarding story, characters and the town building mechanics, which still managed to show promise in a short one hour session, I cannot wait to sit down and spend more time with what it setting out to be a more than worthy new entry in the series when it launches on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
