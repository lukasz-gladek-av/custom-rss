			<p>Although life continues to be grim for fans of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls</em></strong> series, as the wait for the sixth entry in the series gets more difficult to bear with each passing day, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025</strong> brought a smile to more than a few of them with the release of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>, a remake of the fourth entry in the series by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> powered by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unreal Engine 5</strong> which leaves the original gameplay almost intact.</p>



<p>Right from the outset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"><strong>the game's shadowdrop appeared successful</strong></a>, which wasn't surprising given how popular the game remained following its 2006 release. However, nostalgia is not as powerful as some may think for engagement, as many players got their fix in about 10 hours before dropping the game.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/how-2025s-xbox-published-games-sold"><strong>a new report</strong></a> shared a couple of days <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ago,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong>&nbsp;looked at how well&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox-published</strong>&nbsp;games performed</span> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong>, starting with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>. The remake sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1.1 million copies</strong> on the system, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"proving the pull of Bethesda’s legacy catalogue on PlayStation hardware,"</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Elliot</strong> wrote in the Substack post. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Over 80% of Oblivion’s PS5 copies were sold during its first month on the market, but some discounts to $33 over the past couple of months have led to small sales spikes,"</em> the analyst added.</p>



<p>While sales were solid, player engagement wasn't impressive at all for a massive RPG, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"around half of Oblivion Remastered players on PS5 played for less than 15 hours, showing that most people got their nostalgia fix before meaningfully progressing."</em> Considering how easy it is to lose oneself in Cyrondiil before making any real progress in the main story, this highlights that a remake needs more than improved visuals to keep players engaged past the point where they get their nostalgia fix.</p>



<p>However, there could be a few more reasons why those who purchased <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong> did not play for long, besides the lack of new content. For starters, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">the game still runs poorly across all formats</a></strong>, and the performance hiccups make it challenging to enjoy the new visuals. In addition, the game does not support <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-8k-texture-packs/">mods</a></strong> on consoles, preventing it from achieving the same enduring popularity as its sequel, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Skyrim</em></strong>.</p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> selling reasonably well, regardless of how long players have lost themselves in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyrodiil</strong>, it will be interesting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em></strong> will fare on the system. While the latest <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RPG</strong> by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> is far from being as popular as previous games from the studio, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong> believes it will outperform the remake developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Virtuos</strong>. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/"><strong>the rumored 2.0 update</strong></a> will also provide reasons for jaded players like me to return to the game, whose opinion on it<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/"><strong> soured a lot in the months after its release.</strong></a></p>

			<p>Over the past few years, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CAPCOM</strong> has done an excellent job keeping the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil</em></strong> series in the spotlight by releasing remakes of the first four entries in the series alongside new entries in the series, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">Resident Evil VII Biohazard</a></em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a></em></strong>. This approach not only provided fans of the series with multiple entries to enjoy, but also revitalized it, which had looked like it was losing what made it so special with the widely criticized sixth entry.</p>



<p>2026 looks set to be an excellent year for fans of the series. In a little over a month, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em></strong> will launch on <strong>PC</strong> and consoles, marking the return of <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong> to a mainline entry in the series and a dual gameplay style that looks incredibly compelling.</p>



<p>The launch of the ninth main entry in the series, however, isn't everything fans reportedly have to look forward to despite the disappointing lack of news of this month's <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/">Resident Evil Showcase</a></em></strong>, as another <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> remake will be announced in the coming months, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>Addressing community speculation fueled by a social media post made by <strong>Eva La Dare</strong>, the voice actress of <strong>Sheva</strong>, protagonist of the fifth entry in the series together with <strong>Chris Redfield</strong>, who teased something for the series' <strong>30th anniversary</strong> this <strong>March</strong>, known series <strong><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insider Dusk Golem reported</a></strong> that <em>"there is NOT a Resident Evil 5 Remake that's going to be announced this year."</em></p>



<p><em>"Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you,"</em> the insider continued. While a remake of the survival horror game, which made its debut on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">SEGA Dreamcast</strong> in early <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2000</strong> has been<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/"> rumored to be in the works for a while</a></strong>, this is the first time we heard that it could be revealed ahead of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Zero</em></strong> remake, which has also been rumored to be in the works for a while.</p>



<p>While we have to take what Dusk Golem revealed with a grain of salt, the insider has proven quite reliable with both older and more recent Resident Evil series rumors. Last year, the insider revealed that Leon would be the second Resident Evil Requiem protagonist, ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/"><strong>confirmation during this year's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Game Awards</em> show.</strong></a></p>



<p>Following the release of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 4</em></strong> remake, which improved the original without revolutionizing the original formula which aged quite well, it will be exciting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CAPCOM</strong> will modernize <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Code Veronica</em></strong> in its remake.</p>



<p>The original's formula is based into the series' roots, and has quite a few divisive narrative and gameplay choices, including the infamous <strong>Fire Extinguisher trap</strong> which may prevent players from obtaining a powerful weapon, sudden character swaps between <strong>Chris</strong> and <strong>Claire</strong>, excessive backtracing and some harsh difficulty spikes which would definitely need to be addressed to keep the series momentum going strong as it has in the past few years.</p>
