			<p>A new Indiana Jones and The Great Circle video shared online today compares all console versions, highlighting how the Xbox Series X version is closer to the PlayStation 5 Pro version than the base model release.</p>
<p>The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil Pixel</a> takes a good look at the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game, showing an early game sequence running on all systems while keeping track of the performance, which is rock solid on all three systems in terms of frame time and frames per second, and the render resolution. While the PlayStation 5 Pro version obviously runs at the highest resolution, native 4K most of the time, the Xbox Series X doesn't lag too far behind, having a smaller gap with the PlayStation 5 Pro version than with the base PlayStation 5 version, which is made more impressive by the console's power usage.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle would run best on PlayStation 5 Pro, considering it is the most powerful console available on the market. Besides running at native 4K resolution most of the time, this version of the game comes with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-playstation-5-pro-global-illumination-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhancements</a> over the other systems, which include light global illumination, ambient occlusion, and contact shadows improvements.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The game is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro for owners of the Premium Edition, and will release for everyone else later today.</p>

			<p>With the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/">Minecraft movie</a>, Microsoft's head of gaming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-would-rather-revisit-owned-ips-than-rely-on-more-licensed-games/">Phil Spencer</a>, took an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/">Variety</a> to discuss how Microsoft and Xbox feel about navigating the future of its adaptations.</p>
<p>In that conversation, Spencer also commented quickly on what Xbox has lined up for the rest of 2025. He avoided accidentally leaking anything, but he does confirm that there are more unannounced titles beyond what Xbox has already officially announced. Along with what we do know, Spencer feels "<em>great</em>" about Xbox's 2025 lineup.</p>
<p>"<em>For us and the rest of this calendar year, I really feel great about the slate of games. We just had “Avowed” come out, and I have to go backwards and just say Obsidian continues to do a great job. We’ve obviously talked about “The Outer Worlds 2,” “South of Midnight,” “Doom.” There’s more stuff, some stuff that’s unannounced and I’m walking in my head to make sure I don’t leak anything.</em>"</p>
<p>One of the games that Spencer is trying to avoid talking about is likely the one that has already leaked: the remaster of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, which could be officially confirmed in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Other potential titles could be the long-rumored Gears of War and Halo Collections coming to PlayStation and possibly even Nintendo. There's been less buzz around those of late, but if Xbox continues to be as good at keeping secrets the way it's kept the Oblivion remaster a secret, we won't have to wait very long to hear more about either collection.</p>
<p>Spencer was also asked about the Nintendo Switch 2, and he said that he wants to support it and that "<em>Nintendo has been a great partner."</em></p>
<p>"<em>We think it is a unique way for us to reach players who aren’t PC players, who aren’t players on Xbox...I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them. And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.</em>"</p>
<p>Speaking of Xbox's future, the platform's next big date will be its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">upcoming June showcase</a>. After that, we'll have a better idea of what 2025 looks like for Xbox.</p>
