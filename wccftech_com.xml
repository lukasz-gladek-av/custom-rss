			<p>Bethesda showed even more support to the Skyblivion mod team, and invited them to tour Bethesda Studios headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. The Skyblivion team shared the excursion with <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1923793664112726161">a post on X</a>, with photos from the studio and with developers from Bethesda, including Todd Howard, thanking the studio for having them and showing them around.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you to our friends Bethesda Studios for having us over and showing us around!</em>" the post reads. "<em>Meeting the legendary people behind some of our favorite games was incredible and was only matched by their shared enthusiasm for Skyblivion and the modding community</em>."</p>
<p>It's the latest show of support after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">Bethesda gifted the entire Skyblivion team game keys</a> for the recently released Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p>If you weren't aware, Skyblivion is a total conversion mod effort to take The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and recreate it in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It's been in development for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/">more than eight years</a>, and is finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">due to release sometime in 202</a>5, though it'll just be the base Oblivion game on launch, with the Oblivion DLCs due to come sometime later.</p>
<p>When the Oblivion Remaster was first spotted online, ahead of it being officially revealed, Wccftech reached out to the Skyblivion team, who had no ill-will towards the work that Bethesda was doing in its own remastering of Oblivion.</p>
<p>"<em>For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster,</em>" said the Skyblivion team lead Rebelzize.</p>
<p>"<em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different from what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing [Skyblivion] was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-plans-to-continue-making-games-in-some-way-even-after-he-has-passed-away/">Hideo Kojima</a> and Kojima Productions next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-could-last-nearly-twice-as-much-as-the-original-has-more-combat-because-people-ask-kojima-for-mgs/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is due to release in a little more than a month. After that, it's anyone's guess as to when the next games we know Kojima has cooking, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-return-to-stealth-physint-spurred-by-brush-with-death/">Physint</a>, are going to hit store shelves.</p>
<p>Kojima's guess, at least regarding Physint, is that we won't see its release for another "<em>five or six years</em>." That's what he told French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/">Le Film Français</a> in a recent interview (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/">VGC</a>), when talking about his future projects, and aspirations to make movies, now that Death Stranding 2 is nearly out the door.</p>
<p>"<em>Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development. That will take me another five or six years. Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film. I grew up with cinema. Directing would be a kind of homage to it. Besides, I'm getting older, and I would prefer to do it while still young.</em>"</p>
<p>Kojima doesn't talk about OD, so perhaps OD is right in the middle of the five-to-six-year period, or it'll come afterward, with him working on OD alongside his first big film project. That's all just speculation, but unless we're due to hear that OD has been canceled, it arguably has to be somewhere in the next decade.</p>
<p>I mean, realistically, how much longer will Kojima keep working? He's currently 61, and if his estimation for Physint is correct, then he's technically also just confirmed the first cross-generational release between PS5 and PS6, unless, of course, the PS5 sticks around for more than a decade. And by that time, he'll be 67, looking to start directing movies, and maybe even still working on OD.</p>
<p>This all puts even more importance on Death Stranding 2. Whether you like Kojima's work or not, he's been one of the video game industry's most influential creators for years now. DS2 is officially one of the last game's we'll see from Hideo Kojima, and marks the closing of an era in video games with him officially looking at the exit door, even if he's not yet put a foot over the edge.</p>
