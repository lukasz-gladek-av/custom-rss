			<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/demons-souls-polishing-diamond/"> Demon's Souls PlayStation 5 remake</a> has been updated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">support the system's Power Saver Mode</a>, and the performance and resolution tweaks, and the reduced system power consumption may be the first glimpse at what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">rumored PlayStation handheld could deliver</a> running PS5 games.</p>



<p>The remake developed by Bluepoint Games, which launched with the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, has now been updated to support the new Power Saver Mode, as indicated by the little leaf icon on the system's main menu. Introducing this mode, which reduces the system's power consumption, is SIE's commitment to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html">"Road to Zero"</a> environmental plan launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-screenshots-and-performance">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Screenshots and Performance </h2>



<p>Although Power Saver mode has been <span>officially implemented on PS5 as part of a b</span>igger environmental effort,&nbsp;it has long been speculated&nbsp;that its implementation and limitations could be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">a testing ground for the rumored PlayStation handheld</a>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">allegedly going to run PS5 games as well</a>.</p>



<p>The performance and resolution tweaks introduced in Demon's Souls remake definitely support this theory in part, at the very least. As can be seen from this set of screenshots I have captured from my launch PlayStation 5 at the start of the game, the resolution in Power Saver mode is lower than the resolution of both Performance and Cinematic display modes, even at a quick glance.</p>

<p>The frame rate target of the game's has also been changed for Power Saver mode, going from the 60 FPS of Performance Mode to 30 FPS. The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@user-el8fc5xg9h">?.?</a> accurately represents the experience, which is not the best for a home console for this type of game, but that wouldn't be terribly bad on a handheld gaming system.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-reduced-energy-usage">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Reduced Energy Usage</h2>



<p>Power Saver Mode delivers impressive reductions in energy usage as well. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-to-recieve-power-saving-mode-which-will-scale-back-performance-on-compatible-games-rumored-to-be-used-as-upcoming-portables-power-target.1250814/page-5#post-146505994">In a test conducted by ResetERA forums member vicegold</a>, power consumption went from hovering at ~224 W in the regular operating mode to ~98 W with power saver mode, which is quite a big difference. While this power consumption target is way too high for a handheld gaming system, the fact that the game wasn't horribly downgraded to achieve it with some software tweaks bodes quite well for the rumored handheld, which would require games to be tweaked similarly to run well on it.</p>



<p>The Demon's Souls remake is only one of the PlayStation 5 games that will be patched to support Power Saver mode. Among other titles to support the feature will be Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which will be another interesting game to test, given its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">solid 60 FPS performance and high-quality visuals.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Marc-Alexis Côté, the former head of the Assassin's Creed series at Ubisoft has clarified a key detail of his sudden departure from Ubisoft. Earlier this week, we learned <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">through an IGN report (which Wccftech independently verified),</a> that Marc-Alexis Côté had left Ubisoft after 20 years with the company, 16 of them working on the Assassin's Creed franchise, and his final three as head of the entire franchise.</p>



<p>Côté's departure was framed as a result of the restructuring caused by Ubisoft's new subsidiary, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a>, a branch opened to house the Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry brands that Ubisoft established in collaboration with Tencent. A Ubisoft spokesperson confirmed to Wccftech by email that Côté "<em>was offered various leadership roles [within Vantage Studios] but respectfully declined</em>," and refused to speak further about the roles in question.</p>



<p>According to Côté, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/">in a post on his personal LinkedIn account</a>, that's not how things shook out.</p>



<p>"<em>Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin's Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice,</em>" Côté writes.</p>



<p>"<em>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin's Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>I want to be clear that I hold no resentment. Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside."</em></p>



<p>So, while Ubisoft's version of events can still be technically true in that there was a potential role for Côté within Vantage Studios that he said no to, we now know that Ubisoft did not really give Côté a choice in the matter, and it almost seems like their preference was to lose a stalwart of the series, someone who had been through key periods of the franchise in lead creative roles, and who knew the franchise so intimately he could be at the helm of everything to do with Assassin's Creed, than to keep him.</p>



<p>It cannot be overstated that Côté's loss is a big one for Ubisoft, since veterans like him can be essential to keeping a long-running franchise alive and well, not just for their own leadership capabilities but also for their ability to mentor the next generation. Pushing out one of the people most knowledgeable about Assassin's Creed at Ubisoft is not necessarily a great start for Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>In any case, it'll be interesting to see how the Vantage Studios co-leads, Charlie Guillemot, the son of Ubisoft's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, and Christophe Derennes, carry the series forward.</p>

			<p>A long time ago, developers Double Fine burst onto the scene with the flop that was Psychonauts, following this up with the equally floppy Brütal Legend. Of course, Psychonauts became a cult classic, and I enjoyed Jack Black's Musical Strategy more than most. However, these efforts resulted in Double Fine spending a few years creating smaller titles before the massive Kickstarter success of Broken Age, followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/psychonauts-2-mindblowing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psychonauts 2</a>'s success on the Fig crowdfunding network, and the acquisition by Microsoft. This brings us to Keeper, their first game in four years.</p>



<p>So with that long introduction out of the way, let's talk about Keeper. You can tell this is a Double Fine game, with its unique art style, a story that is somewhat "out there", and just something that is generally difficult to pin down for one reason or another.</p>


<figure>
<div>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Let's start with what is easy to pin down: this is an adventure/walking simulator. There are puzzles, but I'm going to say it's not really a puzzle game because everything can be solved by just moving your character's head the right way, and then moving forward. There's no real thinking required. Sure, there are some where you have to shine your light on something, to free something else, and then take that something somewhere, but it's not going to test you.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not meant to test you. Keeper is about the journey and the story, more than anything else. The premise of the game is that you are a lighthouse that has gained sentience after a bird crashes into you. How you gained sentience, who knows? How you retain that sentience after (spoilers) being demolished, and being turned into a ship, a Beyblade, and then a crab-ship, I still have no idea.</p>



<p>What I do know is that the theme of the game, being about light fighting off darkness, is a little obvious, even if Double Fine has made it clear that the player is to take away from it what they will. The open cinematic is so reminiscent of Gandalf shining light to push off the Nazgul to save Faramir; it can't be a coincidence. If there is meant to be some deeper meaning, it was utterly lost on me.</p>



<p>Which is a shame, because there are positives to take away from Keeper. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, with an art style I can't take my eyes off of. The scenery and settings, particularly some of the stranger ones when magic comes into play, are like walking through beautiful paintings. There are some little secrets to find, so slight exploration is rewarded to an extent, but the problem is that Keeper is at its best about halfway through.</p>

<p>I'll explain, but then it's going to be a bit more negative. Keeper has a part which opens up a little; it's still linear, but that's not a problem. What is important is that you surround yourself with candyfloss, and this allows you to jump into some straightforward platforming. There's no difficulty here, but it <em>feels</em> fantastic. As you move through the game, the feel of your character adjusts based on the form you're in, but it never feels better than this platforming candyfloss form.</p>



<p>This ends up being the core problem of Keeper, at least for me. I could be completely wrong, but the game feels like a wide range of levels and designs were created, and the game was extended to accommodate them. You reach close to the top in the Lighthouse form, then you crash down. Then, in a boat form, you go so far before being demolished. Then you're quickly in a Beyblade form, facing what could be considered the only 'boss', before being knocked out. Finally, you're the crab for all of twenty minutes.</p>



<p>The problem is that it doesn't feel organic in its progression, and, at least for me, there are only so many times I can do the same thing without it feeling like padding for the sake of padding. The second I'm playing a game and I'm thinking "I'm bored now", there's something that has gone wrong, which is a shame because that boredom goes away and Keeper finds its stride again a little later.</p>

<p>Keeper is a strange game, to say the least, and one that isn't easy to review. As gorgeous as it is, and as fantastic as the animations and characterisations of the Keeper and its friendly bird are, it is still one that ultimately outstayed its welcome while I was playing it. The thirty-nine stages could have been condensed, and the game, taking up to eight hours, would have been more effective and impactful if it had been an hour or two shorter.</p>

				<p>Would I recommend giving it a go? For the art style alone, I probably would, yes. It's an absolutely gorgeous game, and there were moments that I genuinely had a smile on my face. It was a shame that there were other moments when I literally sighed and said, "I've had enough now," although this may not be the same for everybody.</p>
