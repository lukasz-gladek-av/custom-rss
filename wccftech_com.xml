			<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1874763185238274517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1874763185238274517%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a Chinese app, NetEase's free-to-play third-person hero shooter game Marvel Rivals will add the Fantastic Four (Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and Thing) to its playable roster next week. The launch is reportedly happening on Friday, January 10.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals launched last month to great player figures <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and consoles. Overall, the game has already passed the mark of 20 million players engaged across all platforms, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked highly</a> on player charts in the United States for the final week of the year. So far, the game includes the following playable heroes (and villains):</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Panther</li>
<li>Doctor Strange</li>
<li>Groot</li>
<li>The Punisher</li>
<li>Hela</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Loki</li>
<li>Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li>Mantis</li>
<li>Peni Parker</li>
<li>Magneto</li>
<li>Magik</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Venom</li>
<li>Scarlet Witch</li>
<li>Star-Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Luna Snow</li>
<li>Hulk</li>
<li>Namor</li>
<li>Adam Warlock</li>
<li>Jeff the Land Shark</li>
<li>Thor</li>
<li>Black Widow</li>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Cloak and Dagger</li>
<li>Hawkeye</li>
<li>Iron Fist</li>
<li>Moon Knight</li>
<li>Psylocke</li>
<li>Squirrel Girl</li>
<li>Winter Soldier</li>
<li>Wolverine</li>
</ul>
<p>With the leaked addition of the Fantastic Four, the roster would grow to 37 playable characters, and that's just in the first season of the game's live service. NetEase no doubt has a lot more characters planned to add in the coming months and years, provided that Marvel Rivals continues to do well. While the current list already includes the most popular heroes and villains, there's still a lot of characters left to introduce from the vast universe built over the past eighty years or so. Just off the top of our head, Deadpool, Captain Marvel, Daredevil, Kingpin, Green Goblin, Drax, Gamora, Nebula, Ghost Rider, Ant-Man, Luke Cage, Agatha Harkness, Miss Marvel, Red Guardian, Vision, Colossus, Cyclops, Gambit, and Sabretooth are just some of the potential upcoming entries.</p>
<p>Who would you like to see added to Marvel Rivals after the Fantastic Four? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

			<p>Native emulation of PlayStation 3 games on PlayStation 5 could become a reality in the future, as the possibility is reportedly being researched and prototyped.</p>
<p>Developer Implicit Conversions, the studio handling the PlayStation Classics ports on PlayStation 5,&nbsp;<span>lists on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> a roadmap&nbsp;</span>that it is researching and prototyping the possibility of a PlayStation 3 emulator package for Syrup, the engine that powers the other PS Classics ports. The "Dreaming About" tag, however, suggests that native PS3 emulation could be years away.</p>
<p>As of now, the PlayStation 3 Classics games available on PlayStation 5 with a PS Plus Premium subscription are only playable via cloud gaming, but there's little doubt that the current generation system from Sony is more than capable of emulating PS3 games natively. A test conducted <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-capable-emulating-playstation-3/">last month</a> using an AMD BC-250, a mining card that features the PlayStation 5 silicon, confirmed how the PS5 hardware would have little trouble running emulated PS3 games, as tested games such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Little Big Planet ran well and at a higher than native resolution, even with some hardware limitations, such as memory limitations caused by some driver issues.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, PlayStation 5 users can enjoy a selection of PlayStation 3 games via cloud gaming as part of the PS Plus Premium subscription. More information on this subscription can be found <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">here.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Series S' 10 GB of RAM and developer Game Science's current experience in optimization are apparently the reasons why Black Myth: Wukong has yet to be released on Microsoft's current-generation systems and not any sort of console exclusivity agreement.</p>
<p>Speaking on Chinese social media platform <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weibo</a>, Game Science CEO and Game Director Feng Ji commented on the action role-playing game receiving multiple <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-award-winners-2024-announced-black-myth-wukong-is-game-of-the-year/">Steam Awards</a>, including Game of the Year and Outstanding Story-Rich awards, saying that the only thing that is missing for the game is launching on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. While it feels wrong the game still isn't out on the two Microsoft systems, the Black Myth: Wukong director added that with 10 GB of shared memory, without a few years of optimization experience, there's nothing to be done about the matter.</p>
<p>Given how Black Myth: Wukong struggles to run well on the more powerful Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5, requiring frame generation to hit acceptable performance in some scenarios, the game's directors' statements aren't particularly surprising, although, on paper, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-fsr2-xbox-series-s-challenged/">Xbox Series S hardware shouldn't be challenged by the game</a>. Hopefully, the Chinese studio will be able to improve their optimization capabilities quickly and finally release their game on Xbox consoles, as it's definitely worth experiencing for the vast majority of players, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Leaked Motherboard Analysis Suggests SoC Uses Samsung 5nm Node; NVIDIA DLSS 4K Upscaling Mentioned in New Patent]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-motherboard-analysis-suggests-soc-uses-samsung-5nm-node-nvidia-dlss-4k-upscaling-mentioned-in-new-patent.1072545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 SoC likely uses Samsung 5nm node instead of the 8nm node, according to a new analysis of the SoC seen on the leaked motherboard.</p>
<p>Following the release of the pictures showcasing the next Nintendo system's motherboard <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/">yesterday</a>, multiple users have been looking at the components to try and understand more about the console before its official reveal. According to an analysis posted on Famiiboards, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hr5w0j/famiboards_users_analyzed_the_die_and_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, there is enough evidence to suggest the Switch 2 SoC uses a Samsung 5nm process node and not an 8nm process node. The T239 chip that powers the system is said to feature around 15 billion transistors, which would be 326mm^2 on the 8nm process node, a bigger size than the chip seen on the leaked motherboard. The T239 chip, on the other hand, is around 200mm^2, which lines up not only with the Samsung 5nm node used for the Snapdragon 8 Gen1 chip but with the timeline as well, as the Snapdragon chip was released in late 2021, and the first T239 engineering samples came in April 2022. If this is true, it definitely bodes well for the system's performance level.</p>
<p>One more Nintendo Switch 2 feature that has been rumored for a long time but has yet to be officially confirmed is NVIDIA DLSS support. A new patent from Nintendo, spotted by Laura Kate Dale, which was filed in the United States <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/12182966?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIwNGIxYTliMS1lNTFjLTQ3OTktOWU0OS05OTE4ODk1MzQ3ZWQiLCJ2ZXIiOiI2MDkzNTYxMy1jNDg1LTRiMTUtYWZmMi02NzZhMDliNmZiZWMiLCJleHAiOjB9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this week</a>, strongly suggests that the console will indeed support NVIDIA's AI-powered upscaler, whose main goal, besides upscaling to 1080p and 4K resolutions from much input lower resolutions, would also be to keep file sizes low, considering one of the examples given in the patent itself which mentions the different file sizes between 4K resolution and 1080p resolution textures.</p>

<p lang="en">Another new Nintendo patent published yesterday seems to yet again verify claims the Switch 2 will use DLSS style AI upscaling (Nvidia chip) to improve output resolution for games, rather than trying to natively run them at higher internal resolutions.</p>

<p>With leaks becoming more frequent and accurate, the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal is bound to be imminent. Hopefully, the Japanese company will soon finally reveal what has become one of the worst-kept secrets of the past few years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The development team behind Skyblivion, the total conversion mod that seeks to recreate The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in Skyrim, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwUibq6wBn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a new progress update to celebrate the advent of the new year. As you probably remember, 2025 is the year they had <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designated</a> for the long-awaited release, and this was confirmed in the new video.&nbsp;Then, the team focused on the progress of specific areas:</p>
<p><em>We're finalizing the world map with only the Nibenay region on Cyrodiil's eastern border left to complete. Massive swathes of the map are ready for the hero of Kvatch to explore.</em></p>
<p>Most of the landscapes have been completed (though they still need to be fully navmeshed to allow NPCs to properly navigate the areas). The only exceptions are the Nibenay Valley (268 out of 300 cells completed), the Nibenay Basin (289 out of 674 cells done). As such, 93% of the cells in Skyblivion are ready, though only 44% are navmeshed. The team is still looking for new volunteer recruits to speed up the navmeshing process. Likewise, they put out a shout for 3D artists with a specialty in plants, as only 74 of the 118 3D plant objects have been remade so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Path To Release (Skyblivion Roadmap 2024)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LwUibq6wBn4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many quests were implemented in 2024. In last year's update, the team still needed to add over a hundred quests; now, only six haven't had work on them started yet. As for music, the team has not only ported all the music from Oblivion, but they also added 24 new tracks: one for each region of Cyrodiil, three new dungeon exploration tracks, three new night exploration tracks, two new boss fight themes, and three new atmospheric tracks that will play when roaming through Oblivion realms.</p>
<p>Lastly, Skyblivion was always meant to include the DLCs, such as the large expansion Shivering Isles. However, they likely won't be available when the mod launches:</p>
<p><em>A note on Shivering Isles and the other big DLC. We are currently focused on the main game experience to ensure it is released on time. Once the main game of Skyblivion is released, we will look into how we can tackle DLCs.</em></p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> of an official The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster from Bethesda. That would be a bit of a wrench in the team's plans, though there's no official confirmation for the time being.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-is-free-to-add-to-your-epic-games-store-library/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Store's New Year's Gift is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> from Warhorse Studios. You've got until 5 PM today to permanently add it to your library. Like Christmas's gift, <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy's Control</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance was also previously featured as a freebie <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-free-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early 2020</a>. Likewise, just as Control, in case you didn't grab it at the time, you absolutely should do it now.</p>
<p>For one thing, it'll get you prepared for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>, which is scheduled to launch in just a month. That's around the right amount of time you'll need to complete, as just the main story requires over 40 hours of gameplay on average. If you add side content, it's easily going to double that figure. This is just the base game, mind you - there are also a few DLCs, which you can <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance--royal-dlc-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grab for $3.99</a> (with an 80% discount) with the ongoing Holiday sale.</p>
<p>Originally funded via Kickstarter, Kingdom Come Deliverance has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over eight million units to date. It is a first-person roleplaying game set in a fully historical setting, 1403 Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic), at the time of King Wenceslaus IV. This would already be enough to make the game stand out from most RPGs. Adding to that, the main character, Henry of Skalitz, is the mere son of a blacksmith. And no, he never gets magic powers or anything like that.</p>
<p>It's all quite realistic, and so are the missions, which sometimes ask the player to perform regular chores as would be required for a relatively lowly person in the medieval ages. Even so, Warhorse managed to make it feel fun on most occasions, although you'll definitely need a greater deal of patience than in most RPGs, especially as you learn the unique direction-based combat system. The characters are very well-written, and some scenes are absolutely memorable.</p>
