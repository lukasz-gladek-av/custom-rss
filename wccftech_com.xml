			<p>Mafia: The Old Country has gone gold ahead of its August 8, 2025, release date, developer Hangar 13 has announced.</p>
<p>The studio posted a short video clip on the <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1936076608135172440">official Mafia X account</a> announcing the news, as the team now shifts to focusing on polish and making sure Mafia: The Old Country is ready for prime-time when it releases in August.</p>
<p>The Old Country is a prequel and a return for the series after the last brand-new Mafia game came out in 2016. Since then, we've had a remake of the first game and remasters for the second and third games, but nothing brand new until now.</p>
<p>Hangar 13 has claimed that this will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-says-mafia-the-old-country-will-be-the-best-looking-mafia-game-thanks-to-unreal-engine-5/">"<em>the best looking Mafia game</em>"</a> in the series, and, through the studio's work with Italian developer Stormind Games, has put in the effort to make everything about players' journey in Italy <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-in-mafia-the-old-country-feels-authentic-says-co-developer/">an "<em>authentic</em>" experience</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our priority has always been to ensure that everything in the game feels authentic</em>," said senior project manager at Stormind Games, Salvo Fallica. "<em>The details are absolutely key in keeping the immersion of the player</em>," added Hangar 13's lead writer Matthew Aitken.</p>
<p>We've seen plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east/">gameplay footage</a> and heard a lot from Hangar 13 about how much work they've put in to this release. We'll see in August if this is a strong return for the series or not.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy XVI just recently arrived on <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-720p-performance/">Xbox Series consoles</a>, which means that it's now available to play on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with Nintendo still left out of the equation. At least, for now, as series producer at Square Enix, Naoki Yoshida and creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro seem to have just dropped a hint that FFXVI could be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Spotted and translated by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/">ResetEra</a>, in the most recent 'Letter from the Producer' live stream video for Final Fantasy XIV, towards the end of the stream, as Yoshida and Maehiro are discussing what players can look forward to in the world of Final Fantasy, such as FFXVI coming to Xbox, they joke that Nintendo is the only platform left out, to which Maehiro says he "<em>will do his best</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Letter from the Producer LIVE Part LXXXVII" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zg-LRoukGVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At face value, this is a joke between friends and co-workers, and is in no way an official confirmation that Final Fantasy XVI is coming to Switch 2. But it's not the first time a Switch 2 port of Final Fantasy XVI has been brought up.</p>
<p>There were rumblings about <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/much-requested-square-enix-ports-will-finally-be-announced-for-xbox-and-switch-2-its-claimed/">XVI coming to Switch 2 at the beginning of this year</a>, and now that we know Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming to Switch 2, there have <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">been hints that the rest of that trilogy is coming to Switch 2 as well</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing Final Fantasy XVI on the Nintendo Switch is a pipe dream that was probably never going to happen, but if Final Fantasy VII Remake can work on the Switch 2, and maybe even the rest of the series, than so could Final Fantasy XVI.</p>
<p>Of course, if it won't look like it does on your PC, PS5, or Xbox Series device, but seeing a successful port of the game would be another example of how much more is possible on the Nintendo Switch 2 than its predecessor.</p>

			<p>Sloclap's new football game, Rematch, is officially out, and in just the game's first 24 hours of being live for everyone, not just those who paid for early access a few days ahead of launch, <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1936061475447013553">Sloclap announced</a> that Rematch had&nbsp;<strong>1 million unique players</strong> running on to the pitch.</p>
<p>It's great news for Sloclap, but what was better news for players was Sloclap pushing a new hotfix for Rematch, which can be downloaded now on all platforms. Patch 0.5 adds a bug fix for the ball hitting the post and going out of sync with other players, though still notes that ball sync issues "<em>might still happen under other circumstances</em>."</p>
<p>And most importantly, this new hotfix includes fixes for stability issues, netcode improvements, and matchmaking updates to improve queue times.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it's been a great launch for Rematch, with more than 1 million unique players, and on Steam alone, hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/">92,841 concurrent players</a>. On the other hand, it's been fraught with bugs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lg6j0f/please_consolidate_all_na_servers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">long queue times</a>, and Sloclap has already <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">talked about its priorities</a> when it comes to making more fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Crossplay support is at the top of the list, as it was just hours before the game released in its early access launch for the players who paid extra, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support would not be in the game at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Sloclap has apologized for not telling players that crossplay would be missing sooner, and hopefully, it's not too long of a wait for the feature to be added.</p>
