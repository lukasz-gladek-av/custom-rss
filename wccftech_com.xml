			<p>This coming Saturday, April 19, 2025, EA and Bit Reactor will reveal the previously announced single-player Star Wars turn-based tactics game, which we now know is officially titled Star Wars Zero Company.</p>
<p>Star Wars Zero Company was one of EA's last few remaining Star Wars games after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/">unannounced shooter from Respawn</a> was canceled earlier this year. We're also still waiting for news on the third installment in Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series, though that seems to be further off considering Star Wars Jedi: Survivor only released two years ago now.</p>
<p>Star Wars Zero Company will be showcased during the Star Wars Celebration this weekend. The celebration officially kicks off on Friday, April 18, and runs until Sunday, April 20. Zero Company will be unveiled during a <a href="https://www.starwarscelebration.com/en-us/explore-the-event/panels.html#/event/bit-reactor-developer-panel-featuring-respawn-entertainment-and-lucasfilm-games">one-hour panel</a> with EA, Respawn,&nbsp;and Bit Reactor that will kick off at <strong>1:30 pm PT /4:30 pm ET/9:30 pm BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea of a turn-based tactics game set in the Star Wars universe has had many speculating that this will be a Star Wars-skinned take on XCOM, though this coming Saturday's reveal will be the first time we see if that's the case or not.</p>
<p>At the very least, Star Wars Zero Company will be a different kind of Star Wars game than we've been getting in recent years. Star Wars Outlaws might not have featured any Jedi, but it was still a third-person action-adventure game, like Respawn's Jedi series. As far as other different or new Star Wars games are concerned, we're still waiting to hear about Star Wars Eclipse, which seems to be delayed <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/">beyond 2026</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/">Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, if that even is still in production.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metro 2033 Redux Is Free On Steam, GOG And Xbox For 48 Hours To Celebrate Metro’s 15 Year Anniversary]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metro-2033-redux-is-free-on-steam-gog-and-xbox-for-48-hours-to-celebrate-metros-15-year-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Metro series, developer 4A Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-2033-legacy-an-upcoming-expansion-mod-shown-in-first-trailer/">Metro 2033 Redux</a> will be&nbsp;free for the next 48 hours on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a>, and Xbox.</p>
<p>A short clip of gameplay from Metro 2033 Redux announces the giveaway with a post on the series' official X account. The post showcases the definitive version of the first installment of the series, which launched back in 2010. Redux, the version that is free for players to grab, was released four years later, in 2014.</p>
<p>It's unclear why PlayStation players are left out of the loop or if they'll be included in a future giveaway. For now, though, you're better off running to one or all of the aforementioned digital storefronts to add a free copy of Metro 2033 Redux to your library.</p>
<p>The Metro series celebrated its actual 15-year anniversary on March 16, 2025, and at the time announced that there would be "<em>events, deals, and celebratory content</em>" posted throughout the year. In addition to getting Metro 2033 Redux for free, you can also get the rest of the series on sale on Steam and GOG. Though&nbsp;Metro 2033 Redux isn't available for free on PlayStation, it is heavily discounted, along with the other games in the series.</p>

<p>Metro 2033 Redux will take you back to the series' origins, but so will the most recent game in the Metro series, last year's prequel VR title <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/">Metro: Awakening</a>. But no new mainline entry has pushed the story forward in years.</p>
<p>Regarding what's next for the franchise, formally 4A Games Ukraine, now Reburn studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/4a-games-confirm-theyre-making-the-next-metro-with-dmitry-glukhovsky/">confirmed</a> that they are working on a new Metro game with the series creator Dmitry Glukhovsky. Still, there's been no news on this new title in some months. It'll be a while longer before we get any new word on how the title is progressing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, grab Metro 2033 Redux for free while you can, especially if you missed it being free on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-and-metro-2033-redux-now-free-on-the-epic-games-store/">Epic Game Store</a> a few years ago.</p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle on PlayStation 5 Pro features Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and other improvements over other console versions while running at a consistent native 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> takes a good look at the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game developed by MachineGames, providing additional information on both. On base PlayStation 5, the game runs in its single display mode with dynamic resolution scaling ranging between 1800p and 1620p, with drops to 1440p. On PlayStation 5 Pro, on the other hand, the game is generally displayed at native 4K resolution, as confirmed<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-runs-native-4k-playstation-5-pro/"> last week</a>. The PS5 Pro version also features improvements to Global Illumination, Ambient Occlusion, and Contact Shadows, although the improvements aren't huge. In addition, both versions of the game are extremely well optimized, as were the Xbox Series X and S versions, maintaining consistent 60 FPS with ray tracing enabled.</p>

<p>It's good news that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks and runs well on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, as it is a game worth experiencing. You can learn more about it by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle later this week, on April 17th, on PlayStation 5. The game is also available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
