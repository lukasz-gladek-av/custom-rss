			<p>Pokémon Pokopia is a new spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-story-trailer-pokemon-friends-pokemon-champions/">Pokémon</a> game from Koei Tecmo, where you play as the Pokémon Ditto, who has taken the shape of a human and learns different moves from various Pokémon to build up a farm in a cozy, almost Animal Crossing-like type game.</p>



<p>It's easily one of the oddest Pokémon spin-off games in the history of Pokémon spin-off games, if only for Ditto's blank expression setting the tone for the whole game. A <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-pokopia-arriving-in-2026">blog post on the official Pokémon Company website</a> calls it "<em>Pokémon's first life simulation game."</em></p>



<p>You'll collect materials, craft items, grow crops, host more and more Pokémon, and build your own little slice of Pokémon paradise.</p>



<p>"<em>Savor the slow life as you build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for yourself and Pokémon, then enjoy a rest in your bed after all your hard work</em>," the blog post reads. "<em>As you play, the time of day and weather shift in a natural cycle, allowing you to enjoy your utopia in all its moods.</em>"</p>

<p>It'll be launching exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026, as no more specific release date was announced.</p>
