			<p>Publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-publisher-annapurna-interactive-entire-team-has-reportedly-resigned/">Annapurna Interactive</a> has announced the release date for LEGO Voyagers, a co-op game developed by the studio behind <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1544360/LEGO_Builders_Journey/">LEGO Builder's Journey</a>, Light Brick. Imagine what It Takes Two might look like if it starred two tiny LEGO bricks instead, and you're on the path to picturing LEGO Voyagers. First revealed during this year's<a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/"> Summer Game Fest</a> showcase, it'll arrive on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC this coming September 15, 2025.</p>



<p>The news of the release date was revealed with a new trailer, showing off a bit more gameplay to add to what we saw back in June. LEGO Voyagers is a two-player co-op game, where a small orange and blue brick attach to and form a myriad of shapes with the LEGO environment around them to overcome platforming obstacles, solve puzzles, and embark on a picturesque adventure, brick by brick.</p>

<p>It's an entirely non-verbal narrative, as the two colored bricks will just make expressive noises throughout the whole journey to communicate, and you'll have to solve all the game's challenges by figuring out what you can build to keep moving. </p>



<p>There doesn't seem to be any elaborate narrative embedded in LEGO Voyagers, with the journey being more about the themes it touches on. A press release for the game details that the adventure begins with the two bricks deciding to "<em>rescue an abandoned spaceship</em>," and along the way they discover "<em>the value of being connected</em>."</p>



<p>It all together seems like a charming game that will be up for Best Family Game at the end of the year for The Game Awards, and it might even have a few noteworthy puzzle and gameplay challenges for LEGO fans to dig into. We'll see what the whole adventure has in store on September 15, 2025.</p>

			<p>If you're experiencing matchmaking issues with the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, you're not alone, as several players have reported being unable to get into matches as week two of the open beta kicked off today. EA is aware of the problem, and is working to solve it, though a fix has yet to be released.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955909461945540643">In a post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) from the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm">official Battlefield Comms account</a>, EA told players that "<em>The team is aware of ongoing matchmaking issues for some of our players when attempting to matchmake on playlists</em>. <em>We're actively investigating this and working towards a solve as soon as possible.</em>"</p>



<p>A dozen or so minutes later, the account posted an update, advising players to check that they are using the latest version of the Battlefield 6 Open Beta client, and that "<em>the team continues to assess</em>" the problem and is working to solve it. There's been no update since then as players continue to report issues.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Matchmaking Update 01 --</p><p>If you are currently experiencing matchmaking issues, please ensure that you have the most recent client update.</p><p>EA App: Repair functionality is available via the 3-dot button, and Repair.</p><p>The team continues to assess this. <a href="https://t.co/dy6jN88lMi">https://t.co/dy6jN88lMi</a></p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955912712535380005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The only other updates from EA on issues with the beta have been regarding a separate problem with DLSS and DLAA not being available. For that problem, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955928357909975127">EA said that</a> "<em>The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS/DLAA active once again with the Battlefield Open Beta. We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly</em>."</p>



<p>Even with week two of the open beta kicking off with technical problems galore, it's arguably been a strong start for the beta. At the time of this writing, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 385,680 people playing the beta on Steam alone. We'll see once the weekend properly kicks off if week two is of the beta is able to surpass week one's staggering 521,079 concurrent player count on just one platform.</p>



<p>Though EA would have to solve these matchmaking problems first. Hopefully, a fix is pushed before the end of the day.</p>
