			<p>Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has released a major STALKER 2 patch, updating the game to version 1.7. The new version introduces the long-awaited 'turf wars' between factions, powered by the A-Life System, which was initially lacking and is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being restored to its original vision one patch at a time</a>.</p>



<p>Now, factions can expand their control over new territories but may also lose control of their own lands if they fail to defend them. Various points of interest, checkpoints, and locations (but not hubs, to avoid disrupting missions) are contested by different NPCs and mutants, who also seek to defend their lairs and territories from their hostile neighbors, the titular Stalkers. Other AI improvements have made stealth in STALKER 2 more realistic and less frustrating, because NPCs won't easily spot players who successfully hide in reeds or tall grass, and even when they do, they'll be less accurate when shooting at bushes. On the other hand, human and creature NPCs have learned the art of tactical retreat if the fight isn't going their way, and they are also smarter when it comes to choosing the distance when fighting.</p>

<p>Update 1.7 also introduces a new Master difficulty level, which can only be selected at the beginning of the game, and Expedition mode, which limits autosaves to when exiting camp and during specific missions, and locks players out of manual saving, except for saving to exit the game. Both are designed to increase the tension players feel while roaming the Zone.</p>



<p>STALKER 2's new patch features new anomalies, a rework of the stamina and sprint system (another source of frustration in the launch version of the game, in my opinion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as noted in my review</a>), an update to inventory and equipment stats, some improvements to the controller experience, and a new light rain weather scenario. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full changelog</a> also lists a ton of bug fixes.</p>



<p>The game is currently 30% off on Steam. The PlayStation 5 version <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to launch in just two days</a>.</p>

			<p>Strauss Zelnick, who has been the CEO, chairman, and largest stakeholder of Take-Two since 2007, appeared yesterday <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Squawk Box</a>, CNBC's business news program that airs weekdays from 6 to 9 AM Eastern Time.</p>



<p>During the conversation, the veteran executive of what will soon be the largest independent American publisher (once the Electronic Arts leveraged buyout goes through) said that the gaming industry is moving toward PCs and more generally toward open ecosystems, although the console experience isn't really going away.</p>



<p><em>I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed. But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.</em></p>



<p>The Take-Two executive isn't wrong. The console market has long stagnated, and its three big players, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, are only really stealing each other's customers rather than gaining new ones. On the other hand, PC gaming continues to grow, as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam's record-breaking sales</a>. Moreover, new PC-based devices with a handheld or home console format, such as the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Steam Machine</a>, are being produced, thus potentially stealing market share from regular console manufacturers.</p>



<p>For its part, Microsoft is also shifting the way it thinks about consoles. While Xbox president Sarah Bond has just reiterated that the Xbox experience starts with the traditional console, rumors point to the next-generation hardware being a sort of console-PC hybrid that might also offer access to a Windows desktop environment.</p>



<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-largest-gaming-publisher-want-to-be-everywhere-competition-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a slight hint late last month</a> at the company innovating in that space:</p>



<p><em>We also want to do innovative work on the system side on the console and on the PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things. At Microsoft, we built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for games. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that's unparalleled that pushes I think the system forward.</em></p>
