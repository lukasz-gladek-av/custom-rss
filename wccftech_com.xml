			<p>Vince Zampella, one of the co-founders of Infinity Ward and Respawn Entertainment, and arguably one of the most renowned creators in the video game industry in terms of first-person shooters, as a co-creator of Call of Duty, and as a lead for Apex Legends, and most recently Battlefield, died in a car crash over the weekend in Southern California. </p>



<p>The tragic news comes from <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/">an NBCLA report</a>, which outlines that it was a single-car crash that was reported to the authorities at 12:45 pm on Sunday, December 21, 2025, with the vehicle hitting a concrete barrier, trapping the driver in the car as it caught on fire and ejecting the passenger. </p>



<p>Zampella was only 55 years old at the time of his death, and his loss is one that the video game industry will be feeling for years to come. He'd <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/">taken over direction of the Battlefield franchise</a> and had also taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">a major role within EA as one of the company's leads under its EA Entertainment branch</a>, in recent years, though he's mostly known for his time at Infinity Ward, where he was one of the key leads behind the original Modern Warfare series within the Call of Duty franchise.</p>



<p>The news has prompted several developers and industry figures to share some words about Zampella and  the impact he had on the industry and on their lives, and to offer condolences to his family, who are the ones, more than anyone, who will feel his loss the most.</p>

			<p>Marvel Rivals launched towards the very end of 2024 and kicked off 2025 as one of the most popular games of the year right off the top. It was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">breaking records in December 2024</a>, and kept that momentum going in January 2025 with over <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">644K concurrent players and $135 million earned in gross revenue</a>.</p>



<p>To say that Marvel Rivals started off with a bang would be an understatement, and while <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">it hasn't kept up the kinds of player concurrent numbers that see it go over half a million players on one platform alone</a>, at least on Steam, it has consistently stayed near or above 100K concurrent players, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">made multiple appearances</a> in Newzoo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">top ten games by monthly active users</a> throughout the year.</p>



<p>But all of that, according to producer Danny Koo, was "<em>just a warm-up</em>." Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/games/marvel-rivals-creators-on-leveling-up-the-game/">Den of Geek</a>, Koo said, "<em>2025 was more of a warm-up period for us</em>. <em>Next year, we’re going to have bigger plans. We’re not going to slow down. We’ve already planned more than a year ahead and I can’t wait for our players to see it</em>."</p>



<p>NetEase publishing and marketing lead, Yachen Bian, in the same interview added, "<em>In the next year, we want to provide more game modes</em>. <em>It’s why we have prototypes in the game, like PvE and 18v18. We want to give the players more choices of different game modes beyond the basic gameplay because your fundamental experience might be very different. When you’re fighting against zombies, it’s quite different from fighting against other people.</em>"</p>



<p>It's difficult to imagine what even more success looks like for Marvel Rivals, considering it was already one of 2025's most successful new games on the market, as it seems to have definitively carved out a place for itself in the highly competitive free-to-play shooter genre.</p>



<p>"<em>It's a lot of hard work and it always feels different and exciting</em>," Koo continued. "<em>This game is releasing new content every week. Even my own team comes in every day asking what's new today. Everyone's excited. They want to continue to make this happen. Everyone wants to make this the biggest game possible</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how NetEase continues to direct Marvel Rivals, and if it can sustain the engagement it enjoyed in the past year, and potentially even grow it further.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Is Working with Nintendo to Improve VRR on All Switch 2 Games]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-working-nintendo-improve-vrr-all-switch-2-games/</link>
            <guid>1390354</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has had a close relationship with <strong>Nintendo</strong> for a long time. It was one of the few third-party developers to happily support the original Nintendo Switch from the get-go, and it even partnered with them to create the oddball but quite well-received XCOM-inspired crossover game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</a></strong> (2017) and its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-funs-out-guns-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Sparks of Hope</strong></a> (2022).</p>



<p>This collaboration continued with the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> this year as Ubisoft successfully ported its most technologically advanced games, Massive's <strong>Star Wars: Outlaws</strong> and Ubisoft Toronto's <strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows</strong>, to the new hybrid console.</p>



<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a>, the latter game, which launched earlier this month on Nintendo Switch 2, also includes a dedicated algorithm for <strong>VRR (Variable Refresh Rate)</strong> that manages to keep the feature enabled even at the game's locked frame rate of 30 FPS, despite the hardware only technically allowing that for 40 FPS and above. </p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/ubisoft-is-working-with-nintendo-to-improve-vrr-support-on-nintendo-switch-2-to-bring-better-fluidity-to-lower-framerate-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to FRVR</a>, Ubisoft revealed how it works:</p>



<p><em>Both Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars: Outlaws use a similar technique to take advantage of Switch 2’s Variable Refresh Rate, even below 40Hz. Since Shadows targets 30fps, and the console’s VRR currently only works at 40Hz or higher, we use a clever workaround. The same frame is effectively presented twice, once in the middle of the frame and again at the end, so the hardware outputs at a 60Hz interval while maintaining smooth visuals</em>.</p>



<p>Even more interesting is the fact that Ubisoft said it is working with Nintendo to potentially apply this custom algorithm system-wide. If that option was actually implemented, it could benefit all Nintendo Switch 2 games, offering a smoother experience in handheld mode. Sadly, the interview does not specify any timeframe, so we don't know yet when it could arrive. </p>



<p>At the very least, Ubisoft has added that it is now a standard feature of the Anvil Engine, so it will be found in future games powered by the proprietary technology. The first one to release could be the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the latest rumor</a>, could be launched as early as mid-January 2026. Anvil should also <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appear again in March 2026</a> for the rumored debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Resynced</a>, the remake of the 2013 game.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stripped-of-indie-game-awards-goty-win-over-genai-use/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">one of the most winning-est games in the history of the industry</a>, with multiple Game of the Year wins under its belt on top of awards for several other major categories. Though it now has one less win on its mantle, with the Indie Game Awards, an annual awards show that specifically highlights indie games in the industry, stripping Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of its Game of the Year win over the fact that Sandfall Interactive used GenAI (generative AI) technology in the game's development.</p>



<p>Now, if you're a regular Wccftech reader, then you'd know that Clair Obsucr: Expedition 33 launched with what were seemingly meant to be temporary, AI-generated assets, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">as we've brought it up</a> in <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">multiple articles</a>. But no one would blame you for not knowing, particularly because the only time Sandfall Interactive admitted to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-creative-revolution-how-technology-is-making-art-accessible-to-everyone.html">using GenAI was in an interview with Spanish publication El País this past July</a>.</p>



<p>As to how it got through the IGAs' nominations round and, eventually, to initially winning in two categories, both Debut Game and Game of the Year, <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq">an FAQ on the IGAs website reads</a>, "<em>When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em>"</p>



<p>Upon learning that was not the case, with the article from July resurfacing and Sandfall Interactive finally confirming to the IGAs when the show premiered that GenAI technology was used in the making of Clair Obscur, the committee ultimately chose to retract its wins for the two aforementioned categories, since any GenAI use at all goes directly against its rules regarding a game's eligibility.</p>



<p>The award for both categories was then given to the closest runner-up, which, for Debut Game, was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796580/Sorry_Were_Closed/">Sorry We're Closed</a>, and for Game of the Year was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/">Blue Prince</a>.</p>







<p>Sponsored by publishers like Annapurna and Panic, the Indie Game Awards is an annual awards show with a jury made up of several notable video games industry organizations, including the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) and indie-focused publications and creators.</p>



<p>It may not attract the audience size that The Game Awards does, but it is no less of an authority in the industry with its jury panel, which is partly what makes this whole situation so odd, as Sandfall Interactive seems to have potentially lied directly to notable industry bodies about its use of GenAI in Clair Obscur's development.</p>



<p>It could be that the representative who initially confirmed there was no GenAI use was unaware of it, and Sandfall never realized the confusion until it was too late. That's the most generous reading of what could have happened. The least generous would be that, even if Sandfall realized the issue, the studio chose not to make the IGAs aware and retract its own eligibility, for fear of drawing more attention to the fact that the studio did, in fact, use GenAI technology.</p>



<p>Whether you think GenAI tech should be used in game development or not, the last couple of weeks have proven that it is still a controversial topic among players and game developers alike. Everything that has happened so far <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">with Larian Studios admitting its own GenAI use</a> shows that no matter how universally beloved a studio and its work is, players and developers against GenAI technology will rally and loudly proclaim their disappointment.</p>



<p>That said, the reality of the video game industry seems to be turning more towards <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">more and more studios at least testing out the technology in their development pipelines</a>, if not using it to create final in-game assets. If none of those games continue to qualify for Indie Game Awards, it's unlikely they'll shed any tears about that. </p>



<p>But with how coy Sandfall Interactive has seemingly been with its own GenAI use, it seems like we're still going to have a fair share of developers who fear the backlash that comes with the public knowing you've 'gone to the dark side,' so to speak. </p>
