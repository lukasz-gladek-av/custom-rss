            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, in a new video published by Sony and AMD, PlayStation console architect Mark Cerny and AMD's senior vice president and general manager of computing and graphics, Jack Huynh, talked about Project Amethyst and the two companies' "<em>shared vision</em>" for the future of gaming technologies and hardware. While most of the video was focused on what these three technologies will be, Cerny did slide in a slight tease for when we'll be seeing PlayStation 6 and that next generation of hardware.</p>



<p>"<em>Overall, it's of course still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now, but the results are quite promising, and I'm really excited about bringing them to a future console, in a few years time</em>," Cerny said towards the end of the video after <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/">discussing advancements like Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression</a> for most of the video.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's not a lot to go off, of course, but it does at least give us public confirmation of the timeline that Cerny, Sony, and AMD have in their heads for when we can expect PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 was released in 2020, with its mid-generation refresh and improved 'professional' version arriving last year in 2024. It wouldn't be surprising to see the PlayStation 5 generation last at least seven or eight years, putting an estimated release window for PlayStation 6 in 2028 or even 2029.</p>



<p>Even with the next generation still being years away, we've already heard several rumours about what the PS6 will include, like rumoured specs that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/">estimate it'll have somewhere between 34 and 40 teraflops</a>, and even what it'll not include, like a built-in disc drive that's tied to the console. It'll instead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-reportedly-have-detachable-disc-drive-at-launch-ps6/">have a detachable disc drive at launch</a>, which lines up with the current state of new PS5 consoles, since the disc drive on every model PlayStation makes now is detachable.</p>



<p>The video is an exciting prospect of what's to come from PlayStation hardware and AMD in the future. Hopefully, whenever it does arrive, it'll have been worth the wait.</p>

			<p>The team behind the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UESP wiki</a>, the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (the most reputable fan-made wiki dedicated to The Elder Scrolls franchise), <a href="https://x.com/UESP_net/status/1976097106516639813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that they have met with Bethesda Game Studios to design a character for The Elder Scrolls VI. They also claimed to have left the meeting 'extremely excited' about what's coming.</p>



<p><em>We just finished up a meeting with Bethesda where we got to design a character for The Elder Scrolls VI. Honestly, a lot of us went into the meeting pretty nervous and even reserved, but now we're all extremely excited for what's in store.</em></p>



<p>Now, they did not clarify exactly what they're excited about. They might have been given a rough outline of what will be in the game; they might have actually seen footage from an early build; or they might just be talking about that character they have designed and how it's coming along. They won't be able to say anything more for now due to the Non-Disclosure Agreement they were no doubt forced to sign beforehand.</p>



<p>Either way, this will get TES VI fans talking for a while. After all, it's been a very long time since Bethesda formally announced The Elder Scrolls VI. It was at E3 2018 that the studio let everyone know about its existence, but it was just a reassurance that the studio would not abandon its trademark single player RPGs following the Fallout 76 experiment. BGS then set to make Starfield, its first new IP in over 25 years, and TES VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only entered active production on August 30, 2023</a>, following the launch of Starfield. Elder Scrolls Game Director Todd Howard had teased just a few days before that The Elder Scrolls VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be the 'ultimate fantasy world simulator'</a>. </p>



<p>A few months later, in March 2024, Bethesda celebrated the franchise's 30th anniversary by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-early-builds-are-being-played-right-now-at-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealing</a> that early builds of TES VI were being playtested internally. Its release window is still far from our grasp, but chances are it might happen between 2027 and 2028. It would certainly be a fantastic year for Western RPG fans if The Witcher IV and The Elder Scrolls VI launched in the same year, and that's not so far-fetched as things stand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Games industry analyst firm MIDiA Research has published a new report titled “The winning formula for Grand Theft Auto VI” where they explain why Take-Two Interactive should price GTA VI at $69.99.</p>



<p>To reach this consensus, the analysts used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor%E2%80%93Granger_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabor-Granger method</a> and surveyed more than 2,000 United States consumers. According to their findings, the rumored $100 launch price (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocated by Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter</a> but <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed by Alinea Analytics analyst Rhys Elliott</a>) would reduce both unit sales and overall revenue. In contrast, the industry-standard price of $69.99 would maximize the sales potential and align with consumer expectations.</p>



<p>The study found that 79% of consumers interested in GTA VI said they would “definitely” or “probably” buy the game for $49.99, compared to 16% at a theoretical $149.99. Among superfans, the willingness to purchase at $149.99 was nearly twice that of the average consumer (9% versus 5%), but it was not enough to offset the overall loss in demand. </p>



<p>At the suggested optimal price of $69.99, MIDiA Research reckons approximately 8.6% of the U.S. adult population would purchase the game, for 22.9 million copies sold and $1.6 billion in revenue.</p>



<p>Perry Gresham, Head of Data at MIDiA Research and co-author of the report, said:</p>



<p><em>Our research suggests that GTA VI will generate more revenue at a standard $69.99 price point than the much-discussed $100. A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table. Below the optimum price, increasing price increases revenue, but prices above the optimum can result in loss of both unit sales and revenue. This is because the revenue increase from those who still purchase will be less than the lost revenue from those who do not.</em></p>



<p>Brandon Sutton, Games Analyst at MIDiA and co-author of the report, added:</p>



<p><em>Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA VI, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game. This notoriety also makes GTA VI the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, Grand Theft Auto VI was originally scheduled to launch in Fall 2025 but <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed to May 26, 2026</a>. Fans are hoping there won't be any more delays, but with Rockstar, it's hard to say.</p>
