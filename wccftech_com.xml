			<p>The Fortnite X The Simpsons crossover is now live, bringing the game to Chapter 6, Season 5.

<p>Each week, the map updates will be previewed through original animated shorts The Simpsons shorts, which have been co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic Games. The first one is already live; you can find it inside Fortnite (go to the Quests tab and then Animated Shorts), via the game's social channels, and on Disney+.

<p>● November 1 - “Apocalypse D’Oh"<br>● November 10 - “Sugar High”<br>● November 17 - “Multiplidiocy”<br>● November 24 - “The Incredible Bulk”</p>



<p>The Springfield Battle Pass includes Outfits as premium rewards, including Homer, Marge, Flanders, Blinky Fishstick, and a Springfielder Peely. Since it's the weekend, you can also check out the Delulu mode, where new Simpsons-themed weapons can be found. Just be prepared for potential betrayals.</p>
