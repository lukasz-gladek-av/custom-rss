			<p>There are always new indie games coming out. Whether they're from known developers or new developers coming out of the woodwork, there is a lot to be excited about when it comes to indie games. They come in every shape and size, with some being geared towards providing a nostalgic retro experience to others being roguelikes, deck-builders, and even a soulslike or two. Here are the most anticipated indie games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a></em></p>

<h2>Citizen Sleeper: Starward Vector (January 31 - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>The first Citizen Sleeper was incredibly popular, and this game takes players back into the universe of this beloved text-heavy roleplaying game. This title is set to release on all platforms, including Nintendo Switch and Mac, platforms that are most often left out of video game releases these days. For those excited about this sci-fi title, you won't have long to wait, as it's set to release at the end of this month when you'll finally get to dive into this world and explore the Starward Belt. It's the perfect title for those who are fans of dice-rolling features incorporated into an RPG.</p>

<h2>Date Everything (February 14 - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>If you're looking for a very goofy visual novel where you get to date inanimate objects turned into people, this is the game for you. We are putting this on this list purely for the comedic value. If you've ever wanted to charm your fridge or maybe even date your washing machine, Date Everything is the game for that. It's shaping up to be a fever dream of a game. There are 100 fully-voiced characters for you to get to know, giving the game a ton of replayability.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Wanderstop (March 11 - PC)</h2>
<p>Wanderstop is a new game created by the developers behind The Stanley Parable. If you like cozy games with exploration, then Wanderstop may just be the game for you. Luckily, you won't have long to wait until the release of Wanderstop. At the moment, it's only being released on PC via Steam. This game tells a story about change and tea, similar to the way Coffee Talk is. If you enjoy the Coffee Talk games, maybe put Wanderstop on the wishlist.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Usual June (TBA)</h2>
<p>While Usual June doesn't have a release date just yet, it is set to release at some point this year. This title is made by Finji, the developer behind the hit game Tunic. Usual June takes a bit of a wildly different spin, as it focuses on the story of a girl who can communicate with the dead. June has to explore the town of Fen Harbor alongside her friends and try to stop the world from being torn apart by an interdimensional anomaly. It is set to release this year, with more details being released about this game periodically, showcasing gameplay and the beautiful art style.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Slay the Spire 2</h2>
<p>Slay the Spire is a beloved deck-builder and is one of the most known games in the genre. It was a huge moment when Mega Crit announced the game, and more so when fans of the first game finally got to see a gameplay trailer for Slay the Spire 2. Mega Crit has been hard at work and has been releasing regular updates about the development process.&nbsp; There will be some familiar faces but also some new ones and plenty of new relics and cards to get to know and experiment with. At the moment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slay the Spire 2</a> doesn't have an official release date, but it is due for release this year, albeit in early access.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Hyper Light Breaker - (January 14 - Steam)</h2>
<p>Hyper Light Breaker is officially entering the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Early Access period</a> on January 14, where players will get to dive into the eclectic world of Hyper Light from a 3D perspective, compared to the 2.5D perspective of Hyper Light Drifter. If you're a fan of Risk of Rain 2, then you're in for a treat with this game. Whether you play by yourself or with friends, Hyper Light Breaker has a lot of replayability, as it follows the typical roguelike methodology.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Developer Direct Might Be Bigger Than Microsoft Suggested, According to Jez Corden]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-might-be-bigger-than-microsoft-suggested-according-to-jez-corden/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're now exactly ten days away from the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23-featuring-doom-south-of-midnight-and-a-surprise-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Xbox Developer Direct, the yearly January virtual event where Microsoft shares new details and footage on some of its upcoming first-party games.</p>
<p>As always, Microsoft outlined most of the lineup beforehand. We know the hotly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> prequel by id Software will be there, for example. We might even get a release window, as there's a solid chance that the first-person shooter powered by the latest version of the id Tech engine will be launched in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>The new intellectual property from Canadian studio Compulsion Games (Contrast, We Happy Few) will be there, too. <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a> is an action/adventure game where players will step into a Southern Gothic fantasy setting heavily based on Southern American folklore. As Hazel, a young heroine who can weave magic for traversal and combat, players must confront various mythical creatures to protect her loved ones and repair the tears in the so-called Grand Tapestry. The game's use of stop-motion animation certainly makes it look very unique.</p>
<p>This year's Xbox Developer Direct will also include a third-party game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>. It's not the first time (last year, the show included Square Enix's Visions of Mana), and we're not complaining anyway as the game looks very interesting, both in its story premise (all those of a certain age, in this case 33, are at risk of dying because of the mysterious Painter) and in its real-time elements to spruce up the regular turn-based JRPG combat. The game will be included with the Game Pass subscription service at launch, so it makes sense for Xbox to show it off there.</p>
<p>But the most intriguing tidbit is that Microsoft promised to also have fans virtually visit a 'surprise location' to see another studio's 'brand new game'. Since then, fans have been wildly speculating about what it could be, and now Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jezcorden.com/post/3lfeu6ablnk2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> he thinks the Xbox Developer Direct will be 'much bigger' than Microsoft has so far let on. The only way for that to happen is for this mystery game to be a really big one.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't seem like it could be coming from an internal Xbox studio. Most of them are already busy with known projects, except perhaps Double Fine, whose latest game is 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/psychonauts-2-mindblowing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychonauts 2</a>. Their titles rarely qualify as 'really big,' though. Perhaps Contraband from Avalanche Studios is finally ready to be shown, over three years and a half after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/abalanche-studios-contraband-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>. Back then, Avalanche CEO Pim Holfve&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/avalanche-ceo-it-made-sense-to-choose-xbox-for-contraband-due-to-the-grandness-of-the-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> they partnered with Microsoft because of the project's 'grandness' - might that be about to come to fruition? Or could the mystery game be something else entirely? We'll know in ten days.</p>

			<p>When Game of Thrones Kingsroad was <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-is-an-action-adventure-rpg-set-in-westeros-but-its-only-for-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showcased</a> at The Game Awards 2024, I didn't go easy on it. As a big fan of G.R.R. Martin's magnum opus, I've coveted a proper, triple-A rendition for well over a decade. This, a mobile game first and foremost, clearly wasn't it.</p>
<p>Regardless of how I feel about it, the game's development is progressing, and now Netmarble has shared a gameplay sneak peek that's definitely more promising than the previous trailer. We can see the clear inspiration from action/adventure games like the latest Assassin's Creed titles, and there's even Lady Olenna herself warning our main character, a noble who suddenly finds himself the heir to a minor House, that he 'gravely underestimates the game' the big Houses play.</p>
<p>Along with the brief gameplay video, Netmarble also announced a Game of Thrones Kingsroad Closed Beta Test kicking off in just a few days, on January 16, and running through January 22 in the United States, Canada, and select parts of Europe (Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Turkey, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Ukraine, Denmark, Ireland, Romania, Finland, Portugal, Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Croatia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania).</p>

<p>Signups are open on this page for Android and Windows PC. That's right, there will be a PC launcher to play the game on the platform. These are the required specs for the Game of Thrones Kingsroad Closed Beta Test:</p>

			<p>While Ubisoft has disappointed fans this week with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another Assass</a>i<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">n's Creed Shadows release delay</a>, at least there's some new info about the title's first DLC.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft had recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/">announced another delay to the next AC project</a>, pushing it up to March 20, with the goal of providing a better game at launch. While Ubisoft's justification indeed sounds fishy, we won't dive into much, but things aren't looking good for the developer at all, as the firm is under a cost-reduction process and is already exploring potential sale options, putting the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows and the general franchise at stake. Out of all the negativity, there's something positive too, as we now have information about AC Creed Shadows' first DLC, reportedly called "Claws of Awaji.<em>"</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Interestingly, details about the DLC surfaced on the title's Steam page, but it has unfortunately been removed for now. Based on what Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/">reports</a>, here is the new description, which includes specifics about the first DLC of the title:</p>
<p><em>Pre-purchase now to get a bonus mission and the upcoming Claws of Awaji expansion. Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.</em></p>
<p>The description indicates that we are looking at 10 hours of downloadable content featuring a new region, likely the titular "Awaji Island," along with additional weaponry, gear, and abilities. Moreover, it seems like this particular DLC might be confined to users who have pre-ordered the title, but this isn't certain for now. Given that Ubisoft has received massive backlash around such moves before and that the description has now been removed from Steam, the devs are probably working on switching up their choice of words.</p>
<p>We do hope that Assassin's Creed Shadows delivers on expectations, especially considering that the title has now been delayed several months from the original schedule. It would be certainly very bad for Ubisoft if it didn't, especially after the streak of unsuccessful launches it has gone through so far.</p>
