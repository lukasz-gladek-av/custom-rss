			<p>Roblox has partnered with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to swap out its current maturity rating system for the games on its platform, or what Roblox calls 'experiences,' with age ratings commonly used on individually sold games, like ESRB, PEGI, GRAC, and USK ratings. The company will also require <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">players to verify their age</a> to use in-game chat by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Players in North America will see ESRB ratings, while players in Europe and the United Kingdom will see PEGI, USK in Germany, and GRAC in the Republic of Korea.</p>



<p>It's another layer to Roblox finally trying to do more to address the issues of adult predators using the platform to target children, an issue that's been <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">reported</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY&amp;t=1030s">multiple times</a> over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ">the years</a>. Last month, Louisiana's attorney general, Liz Murril, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Roblox for failing to implement proper safety protocols to protect children from those who've been able to abuse the platform and its lax security for years. Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">responded to the lawsuit</a>, calling the claims "<em>erroneous</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>With so many families engaging with Roblox, it is hugely beneficial to provide parents with trusted and familiar ratings no matter where they live</em>," said Patricia Vance, ESRB president and IARC chairperson, per a report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-partners-with-international-age-rating-coalition-to-replace-current-maturity-labels">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>The globally streamlined process will provide Roblox creators with an efficient and proven process for obtaining age and content ratings, while informing parents of what their kids may experience before they play.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we're announcing our plan to roll out platform-wide age estimation, designed to set a new standard for online safety. Learn more about the 100+ safety initiatives we shipped this year: <a href="https://t.co/KRIpYzwCVG">https://t.co/KRIpYzwCVG</a></p>â€” Roblox (@Roblox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1963300638219223482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Regarding the age verification, Roblox will use a combination of ID age verification, parental consent, and facial age estimation technology to get a more accurate read on a users age, instead of what it's been doing so far, "<em>simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account</em>," writes chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman.</p>



<p>Kaufman also writes that Roblox has issued "<em>over 100 safety</em> <em>initiatives</em>" since the start of this year, and that these new implementations are building on an already "<em>strong foundation</em>" of protocols Roblox already had in place.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg</a> reported that Roblox had over 13,000 incidents of child exploitation on the platform in 2023, and that employees who had worked with Kaufman claimed Roblox was "<em>on its back foot</em>" in its struggle to clear the platform of predators.</p>

			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday, NVIDIA brings the highly anticipated news regarding the launch date of the RTX Blackwell update: the cloud servers will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded to GeForce RTX 5080-class hardware</a> (and improved CPU as well) on Wednesday, September 10. </p>



<p>The rollout will be gradual as usual, so do not be alarmed if your nearest server isn't up to snuff yet. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-significant-level-up-of-the-geforce-now-experience-at-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, there's a lot more than the GPU and CPU upgrade, though. Features like Cinematic Quality Streaming, Rivermax hardware packet pacing, L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput), improved racing wheel devices support, and Steam's Install-to-Play are leveling up the experience in all regards: visuals, latency, hardware compatibility, and expanded games support.</p>



<p>On that note, GeForce NOW users can look forward to a very busy September featuring practically all the most anticipated PC game releases, starting this week with METAL EDEN, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Cataclismo, Hell is Us, and Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>



<p>Hell is Us and Cronos: The New Dawn support up to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, so from next week, Ultimate subscribers who live near an RTX Blackwell-upgraded server will get to enable that. You can find our Hell is Us review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and our Cronos: The New Dawn review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, if you're interested in our take on these titles.</p>
