			<p>Developer Traveler's Tales (also known as TT Games) has announced its latest major LEGO game, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, during Gamescom ONL 2025, which it says is the "<em>definitive</em>" Batman story and experience that will take players through every major aspect of Bruce Wayne's story.</p>



<p>Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-biggest-lego-launch-sales/">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> took players through every era of Star Wars in LEGO form, <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> will let players explore bits of every era of Batman in an open world Gotham spanning the decades of films, TV shows, games, and comics. You'll even be able to fight crime across Gotham in any version of the Batmobile that you might prefer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>No specific release date was announced for Legacy of the Dark Knight, but we do have a 2026 release window for its arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. There's also no mention of a Nintendo Switch version, making this another new Switch 2 exclusive title for Nintendo players.</p>



<p>One element that seems to be a key difference for Legacy of the Dark Knight compared to previous LEGO games, is that only seven playable characters are confirmed so far. Batman, Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul are the confirmed characters so far, which could mean that this is the first licensed LEGO game that doesn't let you collect and swap between characters, big and small, from a franchise.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, however, based on the game's <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/faq/">FAQ</a>, as we could get further clarification sometime in the future. But it could also very well be the case, as the FAQ also stipulates that Legacy of the Dark Knight will pull together "<em>iconic moments from the Caped Crusader’s 86-year history in film, television, comic books, and games,</em>" but doesn't specify that we'll play through any of those specific stories the way you play through each of the films in the Skywalker Saga.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's still an exciting announcement for LEGO and Batman fans alike, and could potentially be one of the best reveals throughout the entire Gamescom ONL 2025 showcase.</p>

			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, CI Games shared the first cinematic trailer for Lords of the Fallen II. The sequel to the 2023 Soulslike game is still planned to launch at some point in 2026 for PC (only on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/deathbringer-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p2wwhwd5v4v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is now available on all those platforms. </p>



<p>Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>After selling over 2 million units and welcoming over 5.5 million Lampbearers into Lords of the Fallen, it’s clear our comeback was community-powered. With Lords of the Fallen II, we’re going further. In 2024 we proudly announced our deep commitment to be a player-first studio. The V2.0 update was our promise in action: listen, respond, and deliver. This sequel is built on that same foundation.</em></p>



<p>The Polish publisher has also shared the initial rundown of Lords of the Fallen II features, though admittedly it looks a lot like that of the previous installment, with the exception of the community feedback mention.</p>



<p><em><strong>DUAL WORLDS:<br></strong>● Explore two fully explorable parallel realms, including a deadlier, expanded Umbral.<br><strong>FULL CO-OP PROGRESSION:<br></strong>● Full shared campaign progression in online co-op from day one.<br><strong>PLAYER-FIRST DESIGN:<br></strong>● Developed in direct response to community feedback, including optional PvP and custom game modifiers.<br><strong>VISCERAL COMBAT:<br></strong>● Brutal executions, extreme gore, and an unapologetically mature-rated experience.<br><strong>UNREAL ENGINE 5:<br></strong>● Lords of the Fallen’s signature visual style and tight gameplay upgraded for the next generation.</em></p>

<p>There must be a lot more to it if CI Games really hopes to make the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as significant for the franchise as The Empire Strikes Back was for Star Wars</a>. Anyway, to celebrate the announcement, the Lords of the Fallen II team will be live at Gamescom 2025 with its official Tattoo Sanctum, offering attendees a ‘soulslike for the flesh’: free tattoos (permanent and henna) inspired by exclusive new imagery from the franchise. For those unable to attend, a sweepstakes will offer a one-of-a-kind canvas painted by Maxime Taccardi of The Scion, painted in the artist’s own blood - a visceral tribute to the unapologetic gore awaiting players in Lords of the Fallen II.</p>



<p>While the game itself isn't playable at this year's event, we will have the chance to speak with one of the CI Games executives about it. Stay tuned for our interview.</p>

			<p>Activision and Treyarch recently invited a select group of journalists and content creators out to their California-based offices to get an early sneak peek at the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. While we did get to go hands-on with the multiplayer, that’s something that Activision has requested that we keep under wraps for the time being.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes at a strange time in the series for those that have been following the likes of Mason and Menendez over the fifteen years that the Black Ops series has run. Thematically, it looks like a direct continuation of last year’s Black Ops 6, while narratively, it’s actually a sequel to Black Ops 2. As a quick refresher, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 took place across a couple of different timelines, both in the mid to late-80’s as well as the current year of 2025. Black Ops 7 takes those threads planted and brings the story up ten years in the future to the year 2035. Treyarch assured that there wouldn’t be any homework required to get into the narrative of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and rather exists as a narrative throughline for longtime fans of the Call of Duty campaigns to appreciate.</p>



<p>Right off the bat, Treyarch has revealed that they want Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 to be a social and connected experience and started off by showing some sneak peek at what they’re working on for a co-op campaign. From start to finish, the entire campaign can be played either solo or co-op with up to four players. During an interview with one of the lead developers, it was confirmed that there would not be any difficulty options this time around; rather, the difficulty would be dictated by the number of players in a given match. There also aren’t any intentions to fill a solo campaign with AI bots and at this stage of development, drop-in and drop-out matchmaking isn’t yet in the cards.</p>



<p>The campaign itself brings together a ragtag team of some of the best of the best in their respective units, with John Eric Bently and Michael Rooker reprising their roles from Black Ops 2 while David Mason is now portrayed by Milo Ventimiglia of Gilmore Girls fame. Leilani “50/50” Tupuola is the resident newcomer of the team, being portrayed by Frankie Adams and representing New Zealand for the first time in the series. This newcomer has a number of bionic augmentations making her a unique member of the squad.</p>

<p>Sharing a few more details on the campaign, Treyarch is talking about how this would be a “mind-bending narrative” connecting Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 7. These include a variety of diverse missions including a number centered around squad leader Mason’s fractured psyche. One of the brief campaign snippets centered around a twisted version of Menendez’s Nicaraguan safehouse with a massive version of Menendez looming overhead while massive machetes rain down on the battlefield.</p>



<p>Once the campaign is complete, players graduate and unlock a new twelfth mission called Endgame. This massive campaign mission unlocks all of Avalon for players to explore with support for up to 32 players in a single match. Using the campaign as a sort of tutorial, Endgame builds upon everything that players learned and utilized, from the new tools and movement to weapon loadouts, to create a tiered, shared experience. Think MWZ’s missions and difficulty tiers but with more permanent progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To empower players during their “power journey”, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Endgame lets players pick a single Operator and level up to customize their skills and abilities far beyond anything in the actual campaign. Regrettably, a full squad wipe will reset progress for that given Operator. Treyarch only showed slides of what the progression/status screens look like but from what I could tell, the given Operator was called Striker and had two active abilities to equip. A separate Combat Efficiency stat (this operator was rated at 60). There were three different power upgrades showing health, armor and foot (presumably a mobility stat) that each had three different ranks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Weapons themselves appeared to have different rarity tiers as well as levels. One of the two weapons equipped was an Exotic tier weapon with a unique ability: all ammo collected into one massive clip. Whether this means that it’s an actual unique weapon in itself, or simply pulling from a list of special weapon perks, is something that I’m waiting to see Treyarch reeal when they get ready to talk more about Endgame.</p>



<p>Lastly, Treyarch ended their talk about the connected campaign for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For the first time in franchise history, there will be global progression regardless of players going through the campaign, multiplayer, zombies, wargame, et cetera. There will be a dedicated camo track for the co-op campaign as well as the first mastery camos. To keep players want to come back into the campaign (beyond just the Endgame), there will also be seasonal events including daily challenges and reticle changes. Weekly challenges won’t be in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at launch but are intended to drop alongside the first season.</p>
