			<p>In a dev update released by Stunlock Studios, fans of V Rising were given a preview of what's to come in V Rising. The next update, V Rising Version 1.1, is slated for 2025 and is set to be a pretty expansive update, as it plans to add new features, bosses, and a new PvP arena feature. V Rising had been in Early Access for quite some time and only just recently experienced its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/v-rising-bloody-yet-fun-survival/">full release in May</a>, with the game shortly being released on PlayStation 5 in June. Now, Stunlock Studios has released a <a href="https://blog.stunlock.com/dev-update-27-whispers-of-darkness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a> that discusses what they've been working on since the full launch of the game, which includes some hefty new features, as well as plenty of bug fixes for both console and PC.</p>
<p>According to the blog post, they've received plenty of positive feedback on the progression thus far, and the developers go on to say: "There are always minor issues we could spend endless hours refining. We'd rather focus on the results of something we first experimented with in the Secrets of Gloomrot patch and expanded upon in the 1.0 update." One of their main focuses is random drops. They were initially added to provide an extra layer of excitement for the players and to create unique moments for each player and every save that a person may have.</p>
<p>To combat some of the disappointment that players felt when they knew what item they needed to improve their build, Stunlock Studios have now added a new feature called the Fusion Forge, which allows you to craft items by combining different items to be able to take the best part of them to equip.</p>
<p>Additionally, they've now added consequence-free PvP. Previously, engaging in PvP would have consequences, including a loss of resources, which could prove to be quite bothersome. Now, they have added Dueling, which allows you to fight against other Vampires. Once the match is complete, health is reset to where it was before the match began so that there are no lasting consequences from the fight you may have had with the opposing Vamp.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your very own Arena using an Arena Station, a structure that you can place within your castle to create the boundaries of the arena, with players allowing themselves to assign to different teams via flags, as well as fighting it out in duels and team fights.</p>
<p>So far, this update is shaping up to be quite expansive, as it is also expanding on the existing area of the game and taking players to a brand new mysterious zone that the developers have not yet given away the name for.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up V Rising for this upcoming update?</p>

<p>Since Warhammer 40K Darktide has been out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a> for a while, the PS5 version will come with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update-released-a-day-early/">all content</a> and improvements made since the game first launched on PC and will also be enhanced for the PS5 Pro. This means that the game will be coming with DualSense Haptic Feedback and 4K60FPS on the PS5 Pro. The performance mode will see the game run at 60FPS on a 1440 resolution and the game run in 4K30 in quality mode for the original PS5.</p>
<p>Darktide was originally released in November 2022 as a spiritual successor to the Vermintide series. Last year saw the game release on Xbox Series X|S during October. It's quite a surprise that the PlayStation is the last console to see the title released, but there was likely a timed exclusive deal in place with Microsoft. The game also went through a lot of hardships during development. The title was first announced in July 2020 during an Xbox Series X|S showcase event, with a planned release in 2021. However, during this time, the COVID-19 pandemic ran rampant and caused disruptions. The project experienced several delays before the official November 30, 2022, debut for PC.&nbsp;The Xbox version was announced in August 2023 to launch in October 2023, bringing us to the current day of the game being released in December 2024 for PS5 and also being PS5 Pro enhanced. By the way, the list of PS5 Pro enhanced is currently at nearly a hundred games.</p>
