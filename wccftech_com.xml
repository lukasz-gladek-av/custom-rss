			<p>Today, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">announced it will soon require facial recognition-based age verification</a> from its players to unlock communication features. Beginning in the first week of December, starting with Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, and the rest of the world in 2026, this new security feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-experiences-iarc-age-ratings-age-verification-end-of-2025/">is the latest effort from the company to make it a safer platform for children</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>All users can now voluntarily go through the Facial Age Estimation process to secure their access to communication features," </em>it wrote in a new blog post<em>. "During the first week of December, we’ll begin enforcing the age check requirement in select markets including Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Those requirements will extend to the rest of the world wherever chat is available in early January.</em>"</p>



<p>With this decision, Roblox claims it is "<em>ushering in [a] new safety standard</em>," and says "<em>this innovation supports age-based chat and limits communication between minors and adults</em>."</p>



<p>Following the passing of new legislation in the UK, Discord implemented its own facial recognition age verification for its British users. Facial recognition that was immediately tricked <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">with nothing more than a copy of Death Stranding</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, Roblox's verification could fare much better, but while this new measure could do what the company claims it can do, it's by no means a perfect solution. </p>



<p>"<em>As the internet has matured, technological advancements in safety and security have steadily shifted the industry's approach to age assurance. While initial efforts relied on simple self-declared age to manage access to features, the industry has since progressed to behavioral based methods</em>," the blog continues.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, Roblox is going further. We’re unlocking chat and age-appropriate experiences for our users by requiring them to complete an age check through Facial Age Estimation or ID verification<sup>1</sup>. Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">Trusted Connections</a> with people they know.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>This initiative is designed to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for all users, which we believe will improve interactions for users of all ages on Roblox."</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/">Last week, on November 13, approximately fifteen minutes before</a> they were meant to be published, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the release of its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year. It also announced that it would stop trading ahead of the market's opening the next day, which was a step reportedly taken "<em></em><em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>." Now, it has been confirmed <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2ek0UOt9DZO072eswdJsmx/8585762d888e7a5f75001725aba1ab2b/PR_19_11_2025_EN.pdf">that those delayed results will be public by the market's opening on Friday, November 21, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing can stop people from speculating, necessarily or otherwise, and the big speculation surrounding the delay is the idea that Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">is going the way of EA and becoming a privately owned company</a>. Not owned by the same Consortium that is in the process of owning EA Sports FC, but by Chinese publisher and developer Tencent, with which Ubisoft recently opened a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>The same Vantage Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">that now houses the rights to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six</a>, the three franchises Ubisoft considers to be its most significant across its portfolio. It's worth noting that there's been no official word that Ubisoft is actively looking to be acquired. </p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">reports of the company's shareholders allegedly talking about a buyout</a>, but Ubisoft's only word on the question has been, "<em></em><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em>"</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that the delay could have been for something as small as a copy error in the results that needed fixing, instead of the latest major shift in the layout of the video game industry. Though if it happens, it'll continue the streak of extremely high-scale consolidation we've seen in recent years.</p>

			<p>Hades II presents a tougher challenge than its predecessor. With an increased focus on ranged combat and high enemy density, surviving the trek to Tartarus and the summit requires more than just high damage; it demands superior survivability.</p>



<p>While many players focus on maximizing DPS, one specific Boon is often overlooked, yet provides immense utility for nearly every single build: <strong>Aphrodite's Glamour Gain.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-glamour-gain-is-the-best-defensive-boon-in-hades-ii">Glamour Gain is the Best Defensive Boon in Hades II</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251109193532_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Don't sleep on Aphrodite's Glamour Gain Boon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Aphrodite's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Glamour Gain</strong> is arguably the most valuable defensive tool in Melinoë's arsenal, hands-down. It's often overlooked by players obsessed with big numbers, but its core utility - superior, passive survivability - is critical for clearing the more challenging later regions.</p>



<p>The reasons for its power are simple:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Passive Weak Curse Inflictio</strong><strong>n</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> Glamour Gain automatically inflicts the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Weak</strong> curse on nearby enemies. You don't need to attack, Dash, or Cast; merely being near a foe triggers the effect.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Damage Reduction:</strong> The Weak curse causes afflicted enemies to deal <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">at least 30% less damage</strong>, and this stacks with other damage-reducing effects (like the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Strength Arcana, which also increases your attack power at the cost of Death Defianc</strong><strong>e</strong>).</li>



<li><strong>Magic Restoration:</strong> It gradually restores your <strong>Magic</strong> (starting at 6 points per second) while near enemies, giving you passive regeneration to fuel your Casts and Omega attacks.</li>
</ol>



<p>In Hades II, Melinoë is frequently swarmed by multiple enemies from all sides, especially in difficult areas like Tartarus and Mount Olympus. Since more than one enemy will be near you almost constantly, the effects of Glamour Gain ensure that nearly every hit you take is <strong>reduced considerably.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-comparison-with-other-weak-inducing-boons">Comparison With Other Weak-inducing Boons</h3>



<p>Other Aphrodite Boons can inflict Weak (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Rapture Ring</strong> with Casts or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Passion Rush</strong> with Rushing), but they require active input. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Glamour Gain</strong> provides its life-saving utility automatically and consistently within Melinoë's effective fighting range, making it far more reliable and ultimately more useful.</p>



<h2 id="h-maxing-out-glamour-gain-s-potential">Maxing Out Glamour Gain’s Potential</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251110005409_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Broken Resolve Boon makes Glamour Gain even more useful</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you secure Glamour Gain, try to get these two essential Aphrodite Boons to maximize its effectiveness. With these additions, you not only reduce incoming damage but also significantly boost your damage against Weak-inflicted foes:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Sweet Surrender:</strong> Weak-afflicted enemies take <strong>+10% more damage</strong> (minimum, scales with rarity). This turns your defensive boon into a potent offensive multiplier.</li>



<li><strong>Broken Resolve:</strong> Weak effects are <strong>more potent</strong>, increasing the base damage reduction beyond 30%. This is pure survivability insurance.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-glamour-gain-as-often-as-possible">How to Get Glamour Gain As Often As Possible</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Equipping the Beautiful Mirror Keepsake increases your chances of obtaining the Glamour Gain Boon during Nights</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Due to roguelike mechanics of Hades II, there is no guaranteed way to be offered Glamour Gain on every run, but you can use the Keepsake system to dramatically increase your chances:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Unlock the Keepsake:</strong> Obtain the <strong>Beautiful Mirror</strong> Keepsake from Aphrodite by giving her Ambrosia to increase Melinoë's affinity with the Goddess.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Equip Strategically:</strong> While equipping the keepsake at the start of a run guarantees an Aphrodite Boon, I found in my own 67 runs that equipping the Beautiful Mirror for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">second region</strong> in both the Underworld and Surface paths yields the best chance of Glamour Gain being offered.</li>
</ol>



<blockquote>
<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">If Glamour Gain is not among the choices offered, make sure to save the Boon Rarification chance granted by the Beautiful Mirror </em></strong><strong><em>K</em></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">eepsake until it does show up. Maximizing this Boon's rarity early is highly valuable.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-glamour-gain-best-weapon-synergies">Glamour Gain Best Weapon Synergies</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Every weapon in Hades II benefits in some capacity from the effects of Glamour Gain</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Glamour Gain synergizes really well with every weapon in Hades II, as the passive <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Weak</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Curse application</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Magic regeneration</strong> are great to have regardless of the weapon's capabilities.</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sister Blades,</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Moonstone Axe, </strong>and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Black Coat</strong> benefit the most due to he short range of their Attacks. Glamour Gain massively offsets this shortcoming, turning both weapons into really solid choices, especially if you have means to restore HP consistently</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witch's Staff</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Umbral Flames</strong> have slightly better Attack range than the tree weapons above, but they still benefit from Glamour Gain a lot thanks to the constant Magic regeneration, which helps both weapons dish out the best damage they can.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Argent Skull</strong> also benefits a lot from Glamour Gain, no matter the playstyle. Whether you launch your skulls into the enemy or charge into them using the Special, the damage reduction of Weak afflicted enemies considerably reduces the risk associated with this weapon.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-effective-glamour-gain-really-is">How Effective Glamour Gain Really Is?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251118013225_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>All of these successful Nights were completed with the help of the Glamour Gain Boon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although powerful damage Boons are vital, the consistent safety provided by Glamour Gain enables aggressive play and reduces the need for expensive healing or unnecessary deaths. Focusing on this Boon first allowed my success rate to skyrocket, making many of the enemy encounters way more manageable</p>
