			<p><strong>Season 2</strong> for <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-now-live-drives-highest-steam-concurrent-count-this-month/">arrived earlier this week</a> after an unexpected <strong>one-month delay</strong>. While we can hopefully trust the <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> teams when they say the length between Season 1 and Season 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/">was an isolated case,</a> the new content in Season 2 hasn't exactly set the game's community on fire, and players still have several issues with the new content.</p>



<p>Outside of complaints about the new <strong>VL-7</strong> gas (which a scroll through the r/Battlefield page will show you players are either very positive on or very against), one thing that Battlefield 6 players agree on is that they want larger maps to run around. According to series producer <strong>Phillipp Girette</strong> at <strong>DICE</strong>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/dice-has-heard-the-message-very-clear-and-is-now-prioritizing-larger-maps-for-battlefield-6-but-it-takes-a-really-long-time/">PC Gamer</a>, the team is extremely aware of this. But don't hold your breath for a brand new large map coming anytime soon.</p>



<p>"<em>We don't want to spoil too much yet, but we've <strong>heard the message very clear</strong></em>," Girette said on the topic of players wanting larger maps. "<em>You've seen recently in Battlefield Labs that we started testing <strong>Golmud Railway,</strong> one of the older Battlefield maps. That is one of the responses [to that feedback] that we can give there, and the rest is for the future</em>."</p>



<p>So, in a similar vein to how <strong>EA</strong> and Battlefield Studios are pulling on fan-favourite elements of past Battlefields, like bringing back the <strong>Little Bird</strong> helicopter to kick off Season 2, and calling back to <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> by bringing back Operations with <strong>Operation Augur</strong>, an upcoming LTM set to arrive in the final phase of Season 2, we'll also likely see the return of old Battlefield maps, like Golmud Railway.</p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and it's a strategy that will likely add larger maps to Battlefield 6 faster than it would if the Battlefield Studios teams were making them from scratch. But it's not exactly the most exciting proposition to always be looking forward to the return of old maps. The problem, of course, with making brand-new, large scale maps, is how long it takes to make them.</p>



<p>"<em>For the maps, we try to make changes for the ones that are currently in development. And then we look further ahead, as you said. <strong>It takes a really long time to make these maps</strong>. We're somewhat, not limited, but we have to be very targeted in what we do…I think we will definitely take a look at the existing maps, but there's nothing we could announce that is going to happen within Season 2.</em>"</p>



<p>The idea that the team is making tweaks to new maps it already had in development is, again, a good sign and one that shows how the team is trying to respond to player feedback as quickly as it can. But that could also result in those maps just feeling stretched out. We've also seen how EA can overdo it in terms of the size of maps before, just ask anyone who was in <strong>Battlefield 2042</strong> when it launched.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the team is able to strike a good balance and get new, large-scale maps out to players sooner than later, at least for the start of Season 3, if it won't happen in Season 2.</p>
