			<p>Riot Games has announced the launch date for the early access version of 2XKO, its long-awaited fighting game. 2XKO will open its gates to all PC players on October 7, just as the currently ongoing Closed Beta ends. </p>



<p>The developers said the newest playable characters, Vi and Blitzcrank, have been quickly adopted by the fans, who have also already organized many community tournaments during this Closed Beta test. Meanwhile, Riot has been tuning matchmaking and fixing bugs, and they reckon everything has held up well enough so far, giving them the proverbial green light for the next step.</p>



<p>The early access version will add Combo Trials, a full season worth of content, and also permanent unlocks; that is to say, there will be no more resets from October 7 onward.</p>

<p>There will be five seasons in 2026, each adding a new champion, Ranked reset, Battle Pass, and more. This means that 2XKO's tenth champion will be released when Early Access goes live on October 7. A dedicated gameplay reveal trailer and developer update are coming soon.</p>



<p>Being a Riot game, it's no surprise that they already have a plan for the competitive scene. To begin with, the developer is sponsoring 22 community-run tournaments in 2025 as part of the so-called First Impact Program. Each First Impact event, starting with EVO France (October 10-12), will receive a bonus from Riot, and there will be an additional prize for winning as a duo. </p>



<p>2XKO has long been known as Project L, a game spearheaded by the Cannon brothers, former developers of the fighting game Rising Thunder. The project got its final name in February 2024, when Riot also <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a 2025 release window for both PC and consoles</a>. It looks like they didn't quite make it in time for consoles, which won't be a part of this early access debut.</p>



<p>2XKO is a free 2v2 fighting game featuring iconic League of Legends champions. Players can team up with or against friends for explosive showdowns, and master a variety of unique tag and assist mechanics to defeat the enemy duo.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nioh-3-launches-on-february-6-2026-according-to-amazon-japan.1306236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon Japan has briefly listed a release date for Nioh 3, <a href="https://twitter.com/Renka_schedule/status/1970717557629047193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as spotted by X user Renka_schedule</a>, where the game is slated to launch on February 6, 2026. The store has since taken down those pages, likely after being contacted by KOEI TECMO, but the date is nonetheless most likely correct. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was already officially confirmed to launch early next year</a>, after all, and it is also nearly an anniversary for the franchise, given that the first Nioh debuted on February 7, 2017.</p>



<p>The Amazon Japan listing also mentioned a Treasure Box edition that includes the following physical items:</p>



<ul>
<li>B5-size official art book</li>



<li>Selection soundtrack CD</li>



<li>Original desk mat</li>



<li>Sunekosuri fur ball key chain</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nioh 3 was unveiled during June's State of Play and may be shown once again at September's State of Play, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-returns-on-september-24-with-35-minutes-of-updates-and-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to air later today</a> starting at 2 PM Pacific Time / 5 PM Eastern Time / 11 PM Central European Time. It is for sure going to be shown in the TGS 2025 Official Program tomorrow at 8 PM Japan Standard Time. In the broadcast, General Producer Yasuda and Producer Shibata will appear with host Hatsune Matsushima to share the latest updates on the game and face off against a formidable boss in the new "Heian Period" stage, wielding the Samurai-style "Dual Swords" and Ninja-style "Tonfa" weapons.</p>



<p>One of the biggest differences compared to the previous Nioh games is the ability to switch at any time between the samurai and ninja combat styles. Another big addition is the open-field environment, which replaces the mostly linear environments found in prior installments to improve the sense of exploration. Also, in a change from the previous two games, Nioh 3 will be released simultaneously for PlayStation 5 and PC, instead of launching only on PlayStation consoles and debuting later on PC.</p>



<p>Our Kai Tatsumoto will be able to play the game at TGS 2025. Look forward to his report soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-rgg-studio-rgg-summit-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RGG Summit 2025 livestream</a> that just ended, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced a new game called Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, confirming last week's leak that <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-leaked-by-rgg-studio-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed exactly to this type of news</a>.</p>



<p>The developer describes Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties as an 'extreme' remake of the 2009 action/adventure game, promising to overhaul every aspect of the classic title. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio says that the bustling streets of Okinawa and Tokyo will be brought to life in stunning detail, and the reimagined combat elevates the brutal brawling action to new heights. Added scenes deliver more depth and emotion to the beloved story, and new and enhanced side experiences immerse players in the world like never before.</p>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 also includes a brand-new side game called Dark Ties, centered on Yoshitaka Mine. Narratively, it is a prequel where Mine plunges into the dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything. Left with an empty heart, the pursuit to find true bonds drives him forward once again in a dramatic journey colored by exhilarating boxing-based combat and a variety of side experiences. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is already available to pre-order across all platforms (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2) ahead of the scheduled launch of February 11, 2026. </p>



<p>The Standard Edition is priced $59.99, while a Deluxe Edition is available for $74.99. All pre-orders are getting the Legendary Lad: Ichiban Kasuga bonus, which adds Ichiban Kasuga (the new protagonist in the most recent Yakuza games) to the Ryukyu Gal Gang. The Deluxe Edition also includes the Legendary Character Outfit pack, the Legendary Lads &amp; Gals Pack, the Customization Pack, the Flip Phone Customization Pack, and the Legendary BGM CD Pack.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The developer also announced Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, an enhanced version of the 2015 game (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-0-scheduled-january-24-2017-americas-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually launched in January 2017 in Western countries</a>) featuring dual audio with a new English voice track, new cutscenes to expand the narrative, and a Red Light Raid online co-op multiplayer mode that will be released at a later date. Save data from Yakuza 0 is incompatible with the Director's Cut, and there is no option to upgrade for existing owners, who would have to repurchase the game. Yakuza 0 Director's Cut will be released on December 8 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>On the same day (December 8, 2025), Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio will launch Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. A Yakuza Series 20th Anniversary Bundle that includes Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 will also be available for PC and PlayStation 5, though only as a physical edition. </p>
