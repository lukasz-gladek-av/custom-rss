			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched this year after an extremely long wait that left much of the industry baffled, but this wait didn't prevent the system from becoming a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/"><strong>smashing success</strong>.</a></p>



<p>However, it's undeniable that the new generation console by Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/"><strong>comes with some issues</strong></a>, including a <strong>long-standing controls issue</strong> which forced legendary game creator <strong>Hideki Kamiya</strong> to go to some <strong>extreme measures</strong> to fix: the <strong>lack of D-Pad on the Joy-Con controller</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20251219044/index_3.html#clo_kam">Japanese publication 4Gamer</a></strong> as part of its now traditional end-of-year wrap up with Japanese game developers, the creator of the <strong>Devil May Cry, Okami and Bayonetta</strong> series, among others, recounted his experience with the Nintendo Switch 2, finally managing to get his hands on a system only recently after purchasing a second system for his <strong>niece</strong>, who took his launch system for herself. Spending time with the system made Kamiya-san frustrated by the <strong>lack of a proper D-pad</strong> on the Joy-Con controllers.</p>



<p><em>"Even after it finally came back to me, for some reason, <strong>in this age of diversity, the manufacturer itself has stubbornly refused to offer the option of a 'Joy-Con with a D-pad'</strong> since the Switch 1. This just didn't fit into my gaming lifestyle, where I usually <strong>play while lying down</strong>, so I have no choice but to use the Joy-Con when playing games,"</em> he said, as translated by <strong><a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/2004712820403999129">Stealth</a></strong>, touching upon an issue many <strong>old-school gamers</strong> have had with the Nintendo Switch systems.</p>



<p>After continuing to use the original Switch for his daily <strong>Tetris 99</strong> fix and taking advantage of <strong>third-party peripherals</strong> with a proper D-pad, Kamiya-san decided to take matters into his own hands to make the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 his primary hardware</strong>. </p>



<p><em>"I purchased a new <strong>Cyber ​​Gadget 'mini grip with D-pad,'</strong> which I use with the Switch 1, and after some <strong>sanding and modifying</strong> it so that it could be attached to the Switch 2, where the <strong>button layout is slightly different</strong>, I was able to make my own <strong>'D-pad Joy-Con 2,'</strong> which finally allowed me to play titles from <strong>'Arcade Archives 2.'</strong>"</em></p>



<p>As someone who frequently plays old-school 2D games, I have long felt Hideki Kamiya's pain. Hopefully, Nintendo or third-party manufacturers will eventually address the issue and provide <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more controller options</strong> for those who think a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid D-pad is an essential part</strong> of any controller. As the Japanese company itself offers access to a catalog of older games via the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch Online</strong> subscription, it would make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">considerable sense</strong>.</p>

			<p>There is little doubt that the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched with <strong>far more third-party support</strong> than the original <strong>Switch</strong> did eight years ago. </p>



<p>Back then, the shift to a hybrid console was still a gamble, and Nintendo was coming off the colossal flop of the <strong>Wii U</strong>, which made third-party developers understandably wary of spending their precious resources on ports for the Switch. That meant only three third-party games were available in March 2017: Just Dance, Bomberman, and Skylanders. Not exactly heavy hitters. </p>



<p>Compare it with the Nintendo Switch 2 third-party launch lineup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Street Fighter 6 (Capcom)</li>



<li>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (CD Projekt Red)</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Avalanche Software / WB Games)</li>



<li>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (Capcom)</li>



<li>Split Fiction (Hazelight / EA)</li>



<li>No Man's Sky – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Hello Games)</li>



<li>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster (Konami)</li>



<li>Civilization VII – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (2K / Firaxis)</li>



<li>Hitman: World of Assassination – Signature Edition (IO Interactive)</li>



<li>Sonic X Shadow Generations (Sonic Team / Sega)</li>



<li>Fortnite (Epic Games)</li>
</ul>



<p>The incredible success of the original Switch and Nintendo's smart choice to pursue what is essentially a 2.0 edition with its successor made it far easier for developers to invest in supporting Nintendo's platform. So easy, in fact, that the problem reversed itself: now, there were too many developers who wanted to get access to the Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to the big studios obtaining priority access while many others were left wanting</a>, thus inevitably delaying their ability to release games on the console.</p>



<p>The situation <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still hadn't improved by July</a>. As recently as early October, we received word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-can-technically-do-path-tracing-war-thunder-dev-didnt-get-switch-2-devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive interview</a> that War Thunder developer Gaijin Entertainment had still not received its Nintendo Switch 2 developer kits. </p>



<p>Now, though, insider Nate the Hate (who had also confirmed in late August that many developers were still waiting for their kits) wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1py9h8n/natethehate_switch_2_devkit_availability_to_third/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the situation has 'largely been resolved'</a>.</p>



<p><em>In the case of Call of Duty… it doesn't mean they got a devkit super late, either. Just late enough that they couldn't get the work done to launch the game sooner. The devkit delivery situation has largely been resolved.</em></p>



<p>In the earlier portion of the statement, Nate was referring to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jez Corden's recent rumor</a> that Activision is preparing to launch a Call of Duty game for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 soon, thus abiding by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-year deal made by owner Microsoft with Nintendo</a> as part of the stipulations to get the Activision acquisition through the regulatory gates.</p>



<p>With more developers having access to Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, fans should prepare for a deluge of ports in 2026-2027, especially with the new console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outpacing its predecessor in sales figures</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami Is Aiming to Release a New Silent Hill Game in 2026, and in 2027, 2028, 2029, etc, “To Keep the Buzz Around Silent Hill Constant”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/konami-aiming-to-release-new-silent-hill-game-each-year-to-keep-buzz-constant/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Before <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> was released in 2024, the most recent <strong>Silent Hill</strong> game was technically P.T. in 2014, the famous teaser that never became a full project. Before that, it was Silent Hill: Book of Memories on the PS Vita. Whether you count P.T. or not, that's still at least a decade between releases. Now, after Silent Hill 2 Remake in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">now Silent Hill f in 2025</a>, we've had two Silent Hill games in two years, and according to <strong>Konami</strong>, the company wants to keep that pace up if it can.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923?page=7">Famitsu</a> (via machine translation), producer <strong>Motoi Okamoto</strong> says the company is aiming "<em>to release about one [Silent Hill] title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles</em>," turning the long-dormant horror series into an annual franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Okamoto doesn't call this goal a new mandate for the company and the franchise. It doesn't seem to be the case that he wants Konami to have a Call of Duty-style development pipeline to ensure that they can pump out a new game on an annual basis. But he describes it as a goal the company would like to hit, in an effort to "<em>keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following the release of Silent Hill 2 in October 2024, we were able to deliver Silent Hill f in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track. We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We're not sure how far we can achieve this, but we'll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we'd like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>Could Konami set up its own production pipeline to make its horror franchise an annual series? Sure, it could; it's definitely a big enough company, and it could easily throw money at both establishing teams of developers internally and contracting other studios to make new games in the franchise each year. </p>



<p>It even theoretically has another two years of leeway to set up such a pipeline, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Bloober Team already working on a remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>, which could arrive in 2027, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">Silent Hill: Townfall set to arrive in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Is that what it should try to do with the series? That's a different question with a different, and more complex answer. Trying to push out new games in the series before they're ready could be the noose that Konami ties itself and hangs the series on. A quick glance at any game franchise that has annual releases, like EA Sports titles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty,</a> shows that you can't possibly keep up the level of quality we've seen, even with the previous two titles, year-in and year-out.</p>



<p>Keeping "<em>the buzz</em>," as Okamoto describes it, around the series, a constant factor could arguably be hampered by trying to release a new game every year. Especially as the quality of releases degrades, as it is likely to do with a new release annually. If Bloober Team is able to release the remake of the first game by 2027, and Townfall makes its rumoured 2026 release, then we'll see where Konami is at in 2027 with making what Okamoto describes as an ideal a reality.</p>
