			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of <strong>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</strong> at <strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a> was among the most unexpected. It had been many years since there was a Star Wars-themed racing game, so many gamers were overjoyed at the news. At the same time, it was not clear based on the released footage, screenshots, and info whether the game would include <strong>Podracing</strong>, the high-speed fictional sport featured prominently in the movie <strong>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</strong>, in which a very young <strong>Anakin Skywalker</strong> enters and wins a podrace. The most popular older racing games, Star Wars Episode I: Racer, Star Wars: Racer Arcade, and Star Wars Racer Revenge, all prominently featured Podracing.</p>



<p>Now, though, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Gamesradar</a>, <strong>Fuse Games</strong> CEO and co-founder <strong>Matt Webster</strong> confirmed that <strong>Podracing is indeed available in their upcoming title</strong>, albeit alongside other vehicle types:</p>



<p><em>You can’t really make a Star Wars racing experience and not have Podracing, can you? The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and Podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the Star Wars galaxy. However, when we set out to create Galactic Racer, we wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. Star Wars: Galactic Racer offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes</em>.</p>



<p>Star Wars: Galactic Racer doesn't have a release date yet, but publisher <strong>Secret Mode</strong> is planning to launch it at some point in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. There's still a lot we don't know, except for the fact that tracks based on the <strong>Jakku</strong>, <strong>Ando Prime</strong> and <strong>Sentinel One</strong> planets have been confirmed. We also know that there will be a story-driven campaign, as well as competitive online PvP racing with a ranking system.</p>
