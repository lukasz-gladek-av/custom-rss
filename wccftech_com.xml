			<p>Battlefield 6 is out on all platforms in a little more than a week from the time of this writing. With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">momentum built from its extremely popular open beta</a> and the work the Battlefield Studios put in to develop this new entry into the shooter franchise with Battlefield Labs, for the first time in years, Battlefield will <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">have a chance to really compete</a> with Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Which is why it's not a surprise that, with its latest trailer for Battlefield 6, EA decided to take a direct shot at Activision and Call of Duty. The live-action trailer begins with actor Zac Efron, professional basketball player Jimmy Butler, singer Morgan Wallen, and MMA fighter Paddy Pimblett walking along a war-torn New York City bridge, each kitted out based on different classes with Efron geared up for Assault, Butler for Engineer, Wallen for Support and Pimblett for Recon.</p>



<p>As Efron begins to talk, he and the rest of his crew are unceremoniously blown up. Following in their smoke is a squad of more appropriately-dressed looking soldiers, with one asking "<em>Who was that?</em>" followed by a quick, "<em>Doesn't matter, let's move</em>," response.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6: Official Launch Live Action Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EunkRPRzECg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The rest of the trailer plays out as a live-action stylized version of a match in Battlefield 6, with the focus back to the coming game, but the entire opening is what takes a shot at Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Little details like Pimblett's weapon being painted in a custom skin with multiple decals on it, Butler's charm dangling from his rocket launcher, and the inclusion of celebrities themselves are all shots at the modern state of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>The charm and weapon skin are obviously shots at Call of Duty's monetization, though it's not like EA and Battlefield have much of a leg to stand on there when you can customize your weapons in Battlefield just the same. What has more of a foundation is how each celebrity comes from a different part of entertainment and culture. It's seemingly a shot at how Call of Duty includes celebrity cameos and skins that make Call of Duty look more like Fortnite with its mixing and matching collaborations.</p>



<p>Even the song that plays throughout the trailer, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, by Smashing Pumpkins, is a shot at Activision and Call of Duty, as the Smashing Pumpkins' classic was previously used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk5AXoDLf_k">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II's marketing campaign</a>.</p>



<p>There's also the timing of the trailer's release, which is just days ahead of Call of Duty Next, where the marketing campaign for Black Ops 7 will go into full gear leading up to its launch in November.</p>



<p>It's a clear Battlefield vs. Call of Duty version of SEGA's 'does what Nintendon't' style marketing, with Battlefield framed as a serious and intense shooter, and Call of Duty as a cosmetic-driven, celebrity endorsement-fueled, and decidedly less-serious alternative.</p>



<p>At a time when Call of Duty is at what seems to be an inflection point for <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">its ongoing identity crisis</a>, and following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/">news of a Call of Duty movie in the works</a>, the trailer hits all the right points for players, as you can clearly tell from a quick scroll through the comments on the trailer.</p>



<p>While the trailer is all fun and games, the reality of how strongly Battlefield 6 will be able to compete with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is more grim than EA would like. It would be a pretty big shock if Battlefield were able to outsell Call of Duty in any metric, really. Especially considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-games-almost-half-of-all-best-selling-playstation-games-in-us/">how much of a hold the series has over the fans who come back to it</a> year after year.</p>



<p>Hopefully, at the very least, Battlefield 6 can prove to shooter fans that Call of Duty isn't the only major war shooter in town, and that the series is really back this time.</p>

			<p>Finnish developer Mainframe Industries and publisher New Tales announced that Pax Dei, the studio's social sandbox MMORPG, will launch version 1.0 on October 16. The game has been on Steam Early Access since June 18, 2024, which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pax-dei-early-access-qa-mainframe-talks-improvements-from-the-wilderness-alpha-monetization-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last time we spoke to the development team</a> (we previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mainframe-ex-ccp-remedy-ceo-the-industry-is-headed-towards-cloud-native-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed Thor Gunnarsson in 2020</a>, when the game still hadn't been fully unveiled).</p>



<p>Over this year and a half of early access development, the game received several updates, but the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/">Steam user reviews</a> remain at a meager 54% score (Mixed), while recent reviews are even worse with a 38% score. Anyway, Founders will have access to the game starting on October 14, and they also get a free copy of the game to gift to a friend. Everyone will begin on new shards (servers) with new characters upon release, so any progress made during early access will be reset.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pax Dei is available for $29.99 on the official website, Steam, and Epic Games Store, and can be played via GeForce NOW. Starting on October 16, it will be included with the PC Game Pass subscription. The base game comes with two character slots and one month of Premium Membership, which offers +50% Grace on Daily login and Gold Offerings, +50% XP boost, and the exclusive ability to build your own home in the game. Outside of that bundled month, the Premium Membership costs $6.99 a month if you want at least one plot.</p>



<p>Mainframe Industries is already planning other post-launch updates. Verse 5, due this Winter, will introduce Feudal Shrines, which are control points that Clans will fight over. Then, Verse 6 will implement Feudal Alliances, allowing clans to join forces in war and peace. In 2026, the developer plans to further expand other systems, beginning with Grace and the game's economy. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite-after-the-show%E2%80%99s-recent-twist.1311793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Beyond his appearance in <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-guide-peacemaker-fatalities-strategy/">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, Peacemaker has made another videogame appearance by joining the ever-expanding world of Fortnite earlier this month. It was a collaboration with the Peacemaker TV series, currently airing, that's written and directed by DC co-boss James Gunn. However, one of the dance emotes that came with the bundle of Peacemaker-based items has been removed following the release of the series's most recent episode, which unveiled a darker truth to what was sold as an emote dance to kids.</p>



<p><em><strong>Spoiler alert for Peacemaker season two episode six</strong></em></p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-controversial-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite-following-big-twist-in-the-tv-shows-latest-episode">Eurogamer</a>, the 'Peaceful Hips' emote was <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447">removed from the game while Epic investigated</a> "<em>into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote</em>." Refunds were issued to players who purchased the emote preemptively, assuming that the emote would not be added back into the game. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in Fortnite as we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks.</p>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The dance, which you can see in the video below, can seem innocent enough out of context. But the context is what counts, and in context, it's clear why the emote was quickly removed.</p>



<p>That context is that in episode six of Peacemaker's second season, the title character discovers he's in an alternate Nazi-run universe, with the dance, specifically how he moves his arms, imitating a swastika. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Peacemaker’s dance emote from Fortnite has been disabled.</p><p>“As we inquire into our partner's creative intentions in this collab emote. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days.” <a href="https://t.co/hwHqOiid1o">pic.twitter.com/hwHqOiid1o</a></p></div>— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) <a href="https://twitter.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1972176095580754324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It seems that James Gunn held back the true meaning of the dance from Epic, and once the truth was revealed during the episode, Epic moved quickly to remove the emote from the game. Gunn even promoted the arrival of Peacemaker in Fortnite in a post on <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1967015798939283554">X (formerly Twitter)</a> that, in hindsight, carried more weight than we could've known at the time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Who knows why the dance's meaning wasn't shared before its release in Fortnite. Busy as he is, surely Gunn would have seen updates from Epic as they were creating and animating the dance that would be in the game and available to millions of players, many of them children. It's unclear who at Warner Bros. was aware of this and if anyone at Epic knew what the dance would symbolize. </p>



<p>Gunn must have been aware, to some degree, that Epic would do something about the emote once episode six aired. It could be that this was all meant to be just a publicity stunt, though it'll be curious to see what further implications this stunt has on any future collaborations between Epic and Warner Bros, and if Epic adjusts how it approaches future collaborations with other partners.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-dev-says-the-series-will-stick-with-japan-and-katanas.1311748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yōtei developer Sucker Punch Productions is getting ready to launch the game later this week on PlayStation 5. As part of the marketing promotion, they joined a media roundtable where the series' setting was discussed, among other things. <a href="https://www.ungeek.ph/2025/09/sucker-punch-studio-head-on-the-ghost-of-yotei-series-identity-we-cant-imagine-a-ghost-game-in-feudal-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As reported by Filipino website Ungeek</a>, Sucker Punch studio head and founder Brian Fleming revealed that the setting will never really change to somewhere outside Japan:</p>



<p><em>We believe the core of Ghost is someone wielding a katana, that’s part of the essence. We can’t imagine a Ghost game set in, say, feudal Europe. That doesn’t make sense. There are plenty of games set there, but that’s not what a Ghost game is.</em> <em>For us, the natural beauty of Japan is part of the essence of a Ghost game. I gave this answer on stage at Tokyo Game Show, and I think the fans in Japan, really appreciated that. That’s the way we see it. It will always have that core, open-world katana adventure of some kind. Now, we may change time periods, we may explore different settings, but I think there are some boundaries we probably won’t cross.</em></p>



<p>If the core of the games is a character wielding a katana, then it also follows that the series is essentially bound to the samurai era, which started in the late 12th century and ended in the late 1870s, when the Meiji government basically abolished the samurai. Ghost of Tsushima already explored the late 13th century (it's set in 1274, the same year of the real-life Mongol invasion), while Ghost of Yōtei jumped quite far ahead, taking place in 1603. Of course, the Seattle-based developer could absolutely set a new game elsewhere in Japan even before 1603, as the series has been set up more as an anthology than a storyline that continues from installment to installment. Furthermore, both games have been set far away from central Japan, so that's another option that a future entry will undoubtedly explore.</p>



<p>Still, given those constraints, it's hard to imagine the franchise ever reaching as many entries as, say, Final Fantasy, or even just The Elder Scrolls. It's all the more reason to savor the games we get, though, and Ghost of Yōtei is certainly well worth playing if you're a fan of open world action/adventure games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can find my review here</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>
