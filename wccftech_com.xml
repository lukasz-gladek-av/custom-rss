			<p>Unreal Engine 5 adds complexity in some interesting ways that allow the development of games that may not have been possible before but at a cost on PC that will likely only get mitigated in the future by brute forcing better performance.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broke Silicon podcast, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk discussed Unreal Engine 5 at length, highlighting the many issues developers face with the engine but also how it adds complexity in ways that is allowing them to do things that maybe couldn't be done before, but with a base cost that was, at launch, two GPU generations behind in terms of performance, a really unsurprising statement considering we have seen, time and time again, how Unreal Engine 5-powered games don't seem to run well even on top-end hardware. On consoles, things are quite different, according to the developer, as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S have dedicated hardware, such as their IO controllers, that handle data compression and decompression. On PC, on the other hand, there are a lot of data bottlenecks that prevent the process from being smooth, and, as of now, it seems like performance will only get better with the faster interface and CPUs, essentially brute forcing through the issues, getting to the point where latency will be so low and the interface speed so fast that things will get better at least until the next generation of consoles. As such, it may be until the RTX 6000 series when Unreal Engine 5 will run as it should on PC.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine 5 creator Epic is well aware of the performance issues in games powered by their engine and has recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-shader-compilation-systems-prevent-stuttering-not-work-properly/"> outlined</a> what the engine features to mitigate the issues and what they are currently working on to further improve the situation. Some of these systems, however, don't seem to be working properly out-of-the-box, and require developer intervention, so there's definitely more work to be done until shader compilation and other performance issues become a thing of the past in UE5 games.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5. You can learn more about some of the features it introduces, including the Nanite of lights, MegaLights, by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">here</a>.</p>

			<p>The official PC system requirements for Lost Soul Aside have been revealed, confirming the system configurations that can run the game at different quality settings and with ray tracing.</p>
<p>The system requirements for running the game without ray tracing look reasonable enough for a game launching this year, as players will need either an Intel i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU and either an RTX 3070 or RX 6800 XT to run the game at the high preset, although with an unknown target resolution and framerate. The requirements unsurprisingly become more demanding with ray tracing, as an RTX 5070 Ti GPU will be required for the Ultra Ray Tracing preset.</p>

<p>In addition to confirming the game's system requirements, the Lost Soul Aside PC page on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-soul-aside/lost-soul-aside-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official PlayStation website</a> also confirmed that the game will support performance-boosting technologies, such as NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR, DualSense controller, and HDR support.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/">May 30th</a>. Unfortunately, the game won't be available on PC in <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-is-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam-despite-playstation-network-account-sign-in-no-longer-being-mandatory/">countries where the PlayStation Network is not available</a>, despite PSN account log-in being no longer mandatory.</p>
