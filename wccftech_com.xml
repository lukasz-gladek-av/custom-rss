<p>In War Robots: Frontiers, players will get the opportunity to be in the cockpit of their mechs and experience piloting a War Robot. War Robots is already a massive franchise, with over 270 million fans across the globe. War Robots: Frontiers is said to be a huge step for the franchise, a game that has been built from the ground up for both PC and console in Unreal Engine 5. It will be a game that is ideal for those who like competitive play.</p>
<p>Its also been developed to be relatively accurate and authentic, where every step the mech takes will reverberate with authentic weight. Every shot that is fired from your mech will have realistic recoil. Being developed in Unreal Engine 5 means that this game will give players a highly realistic and dynamic battlefield to fight on, where every single move and shot made by the mechs will have realistic movement and help you feel as if you are actually in the mech.</p>
<p>Customization will be a major feature of War Robots: Frontiers, where players can design their mechs in any way they want to, from the chassis, core, weapons, and skill upgrades to create a mech that fits your playstyle and the way you want to tackle combat. By having this much customization, you can choose whether your mech is a huge chunk of steel with firepower, or you can streamline it so that it has agile defenses and the ability to outplay the opponent.</p>
<p>If you're new to the War Robots franchise, this game is aiming to be highly accessible for the newer generations and new players. This includes the ability to play the game by utilizing prebuilt mechs so that you can get used to the look and feel of the game before being overwhelmed by building your own mech. Of course, for those who prefer to build from the ground up, you'll be able to customize it as much as you need to in order to make it battlefield-ready.</p>
<p>The game will also have cross-platform online play, so you can play with your friends on PC and console. There will be multiple game modes available, including ranked modes for those who prefer a dedicated challenge.</p>
<p>War Robots: Frontiers will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 4.</p>
