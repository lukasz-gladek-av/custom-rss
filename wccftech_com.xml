			<p>This past June, EA teased that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-return/">it would be bringing back its series of College Basketball games</a>, nearly two decades since the last NCAA basketball game. Now, as first reported by <a href="https://www.extrapointsmb.com/p/ea-sports-college-basketball-may-be-in-big-big-trouble">Extra Points</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-walks-away-from-developing-college-basketball/">Insider-Gaming</a>), EA Sports College Basketball is no more, with the schools EA was in talks with choosing to take a deal with 2K Sports to be included in its NBA 2K games, and EA rescinding its offer.</p>



<p>With the success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/">EA's College Football games,</a> it wasn't a surprise that the company would try to expand that to other sports, especially since it already had a history of NCAA basketball games. It also isn't a surprise that other major publishers, like Take-Two and its subsidiary 2K, weren't blind to the success EA was seeing and would try to move in on collegiate sports-based games in its own way.</p>



<p>In a memo from EA Sports' vice president of commercial partnerships and licensing, Sean O'Brien, obtained by Extra Points, O'Brien confirms that EA is pulling out of its talks with the US colleges and universities that would have participated in an EA Sports College Basketball game.</p>



<p>"<em>Given there are some schools choosing to accept the 2K Sports proposal for inclusion in NBA 2K, the offer to be included in a college basketball video game will unfortunately have to be rescinded,</em>" the memo reads.</p>



<p>"<em>Everyone at EA Sports is disappointed that we all couldn't find an acceptable path forward, but we appreciate your support in trying to bring a standalone college basketball game with an all men's and women's Division 1 institutions and student athletes, conferences as well as the NCAA, in a way that fans have told us they want. We really appreciate your support. Good luck with back to school and an exciting start to the football season. Thanks, Sean O'Brien."</em></p>



<p>It's unfortunate news for fans of EA's NCAA games, but just like in sports, EA can't win them all. O'Brien's comment on football season instead of basketball season also doesn't seem misplaced, as EA can at least hold on to the fact that its College Football games continue to sell well.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is easily going to become one of the most successful video game releases of the year, if not of the entire console generation, judging from how popular the game already is minutes after its release.</p>



<p>Following the game's release less than an hour ago at the time of writing, the second entry in the series by Team Cherry destroyed the original's concurrent user record of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/">72,916 users</a>, which was only reached yesterday within minutes with a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">103,994 concurrent users </a>record that is only going to increase in the coming hours, possibly setting a new record for an indie game on the platform. The game's launch has proven to be so popular that multiple storefronts like Steam and the Xbox store went down as fans rushed to download the highly anticipated Metroidvania.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong being so successful should surprise no one, as fans of the original have been waiting for the game for years. After being in development for a long time with little to no communication, it seemed like the game would not be out for another good while, but developer Team Cherry surprised fans worldwide by revealing the game's early September release with a surprise announcement only <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-special-presentation-team-cherry/">two weeks ago</a>. While it's too early to say for certain, it seems like the long wait was very worth it, as Hollow Knight: Silksong takes everything that made the original so engaging and brings it up to eleven with more powerful bosses, a full-fledged quest system and a new story featuring Hornet journey through the Kingdom of Pharloom to learn more about secrets tied to her past.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. The game is also available as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-to-be-available-on-day-one-on-xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass library.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been in the works for a long time, but the wait was well worth it, as the new version of the third entry in the JRPG series by Square Enix, which serves as the beginning of the Erdrick trilogy, is undoubtedly the best rendition of the adventure, which, chronologically, started it all. Everything considered, it was also the easiest game of the trilogy to remake in the HD-2D style, as the gameplay, while definitely a little dated, still held up well, allowing the development team to focus on the new visuals and some choice changes to improve an experience that is still considered among the best in the series.</p>



<p>To make the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake as compelling as its predecessor, however, the development team needed to do much more. The original Dragon Quest is terribly dated, with a single party member who can only face a single enemy, and a vague semblance of a story that is barely there. Dragon Quest II, on the other hand, fares a little better, with a set party and a slightly more developed narrative, but not by much. Both games required a lot more to be enticing for a modern audience who did not experience the original or any of their previous faithful remakes than a new coat of paint and some additional content, but sfter trying both games during last month's Gamescom, I can safely say that the two games are being properly updated with new tweaks and improvements that modernize them without impacting the classic feel the two games still firmly retain.</p>

<p>Having only around one hour to try out both games, I couldn't delve too deep into the many tweaks and changes featured in the upcoming remakes, but the little I experienced was fully convincing. In Dragon Quest I, for example, the Hero continues to fight his way to the Dragonlord alone, but no longer fights single enemies, but groups like in the rest of the series. As such, the experience has been completely rebalanced with this in mind, and the Hero's skillset has been greatly expanded with a Scrolls system that allows players to teach their character a variety of skills. In addition, the game features a lot more story in the vein of the rest of the series, which promises to make the classic game more entertaining than ever before, and even longer, as the development team confirmed it will take around 15 hours to get to the ending, as opposed to around 10 hours required for the original.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest II has been similarly expanded, with the Princess of Cannock joining the party and an increased focus on story to make it feel like more than a fancier way of guiding the player to the next objective. Character customization has also been enhanced with the introduction of a Sigils system that grants special effects in battle, bringing the gameplay closer to that of more recent entries in the series. With the new content added in, the developer expects it will take 35 hours to get to the ending, which is a considerable increase over the around 18 hours needed to complete the original.</p>



<p>For the rest, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake played as one would expect, with the classic top-down view, intricate dungeon design with some simple puzzles to solve, random encounters, classic turn-based combat system, and the iconic music that has always defined the series since its beginnings. With familiar elements and well-thought-out additions meshing together to deliver renewed experiences, I expect Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake to be as successful as last year's release amid newcomers and veterans alike when the game launches on October 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>Dreamhaven, the publisher behind the PvP shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504780/Wildgate/">Wildgate</a>, which goes between boots-on-the-ground first-person shooting and ship-to-ship battle, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-out-now-ps5-xbox-series-pc/">launched this past July 22</a>, has suffered layoffs, chief executive officer Mike Morhaime confirmed in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-morhaime-1081a7170_today-i-want-to-share-some-difficult-news-activity-7369069584328421376-7-qL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dreamhaven-affected-by-unspecified-number-of-layoffs">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>.</p>



<p>Morhaime doesn't confirm how many of Dreamhaven's employees were impacted by the layoff, but does say that the layoffs have mostly impacted its publishing group, and that they were "<em>talented colleagues who have played a key role in building Dreamhaven’s foundation and supporting what has been an eventful year for us</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From organizing the Dreamhaven Showcase to helping launch three games, every person at Dreamhaven has contributed to sharing our games with the world. I’m deeply grateful for the creativity, dedication, and hard work of the teammates we are parting ways with. They will be truly missed</em>," Morhaime writes.</p>



<p>Morhaime continues to say that the mission for Dreamhaven "<em>remains unchanged</em>," and that he remains "<em>optimistic about Dreamhaven’s future and the experiences still to come</em>."</p>



<p>Moonshot, the developer of Wildgate, is comprised of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-first-look-and-hands-on-a-sci-fi-sea-of-thieves-by-former-blizzard-devs/">Blizzard and Sea of Thieves developers,</a> which helps to contextualize the games' back-and-forth from first-person shooting to ship-to-ship battle. When we checked it out in a preview earlier this year, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo called it "<em>a blast of fun</em>," and that "<em>The art style is definitely very reminiscent of Blizzard's work, but in terms of gameplay, it reminded me a lot of a sci-fi version of Rare's Sea of Thieves</em>."</p>



<p><em>Update 04/09/2025: Article updated to correctly identify Dreamhaven as the publisher of Wildgate, not the developer.</em></p>
