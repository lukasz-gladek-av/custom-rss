			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>, developer Sloclap's new football game, has just received its <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100">first major patch</a>, a little more than a month after it launched across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Earlier in the week, Sloclap celebrated Rematch <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-surpasses-5-million-players-since-launch-crossplay-support-still-6-9-weeks-away/">surpassing 5 million unique players</a> who've checked it out, either through buying the game directly or checking it out through Xbox Game Pass. Days prior to that, it published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534356176690741599?l=english">lengthy blog</a> where it acknowledged the feedback players have been giving the team in the last month, and committed to fixing some of the game's key problems, starting with a patch that was due out this week.</p>



<p>That patch is here, with one of the highlights being the fact that players can now re-map the controls on a controller, though Sloclap admits that this first version of button mapping is "<em>quite basic</em>," and that a more advanced version which lets players create combinations of inputs is coming.</p>



<p>Better hit detection is the second highlight of the patch that Sloclap hits, though if you talk to anyone (like me) who has been playing Rematch this past month, hit detection should be the first thing Sloclap mentions in every patch notes release, for as long as it remains an issue. Hit detection, whether that's regarding the ball not being properly handled by goalkeepers or with players not correctly responding to tackles, is the key issue plaguing every game in Rematch. </p>



<p>It's good to see that so many of the fixes in these patch notes are directly related to hit detection issues, and hopefully this patch is the beginning of a turn for the better for the quality of each match.</p>



<p>While this patch has a few key fixes, it still doesn't address one of the major features players have been asking for since the game launched, which is full crossplay support. And players will continue to wait for it until sometime in September, according to Sloclap.</p>

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the next game coming from Silent Hill 2 Remake and Layers of Fear developer Bloober Team, and though we don't have a solid release date for it beyond a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Fall 2025 release window</a>, we do have a new look at gameplay with a new 10-minute gameplay showcase.</p>



<p>The video shows the protagonist digging through Sector A-0, showing off how you'll manipulate gravity and your environment in order to move towards your objective. It also shows more layers to the horror gameplay that the sci-fi adventure will feature, as you carefully and slowly creep around each corner, finger on the trigger of your weapon, ready to defend yourself against whatever monstrosity awaits.</p>

<p>First revealed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/">October 2024</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn looks to be the most confident and the most terrifying work from Bloober Team yet. While the studio's history as a horror game developer began strong with Layers of Fear, it faltered with back-to-back lacklustre releases that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bloober-team-claims-its-finished-making-shitty-games/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwityLnytNOOAxVY2MkDHRPGLksQFnoECBUQAw&amp;usg=AOvVaw1q6lWprVE2HpS_CCCQT0qJ">the studio even admitted were poor</a>.</p>



<p>It has since turned things around following its success with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, which has led to the studio also taking on a remake of the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Silent Hill</a> game.</p>



<p>We've seen plenty of Cronos: The New Dawn gameplay at this point, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-dev-diary-outlines-combat-mechanics/">recent deep-dive just weeks ago</a>. The only thing we're really missing from Cronos: The New Dawn, is a release date. Hopefully, we'll hear about one soon. </p>
