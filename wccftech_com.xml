			<p>Once upon a time, earlier in its history as a game developer and publisher, Ubisoft was mainly known for Rayman, rather than Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, or Rainbow Six. The weird-looking character quickly became a fan favorite after the debut in 1995, spawning a whole series of platformer games as well as several spin-offs.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most acclaimed of all installments was also the latest in the mainline series: <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-legends-is-now-free-on-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rayman Legends</a>, which launched in 2013. Since then, though, fans have been wondering whether the iconic Ubisoft mascot would ever return.</p>
<p>It seems like that's happening after all. Internet sleuths have spotted Ubisoft Milan recruiting for a triple-A game set in the IP:</p>
<p><em>Ubisoft Milan <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000058351278-senior-game-designer-rayman-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is looking for a Senior Game Designer</a> who will work on the Rayman brand. The ideal candidate has a proven and solid experience as a Game Designer in the videogame industry with in-depth understanding of how to define, prototype, and implement game systems within the scope of the project and following the Game direction, making sure to capture the gameplay feel, while still being fun and accessible. A strong UX sensibility or professional experience is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em>Ubisoft Milan <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000060046042-3d-gameplay-animator-rayman-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is seeking a talented 3D Gameplay Animator</a> to be involved in the production of a prestigious AAA title for the Rayman brand. You will be responsible for ensuring the quality and content of gameplay animation assets align with the game's vision.</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft Milan is mostly known for Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope<span>, the latter&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-rayman-dlc-boss-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of which featured Rayman</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-rayman-dlc-boss-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;in a DLC</a>.</p>
<p>The job recruitment follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-remake-prince-of-persia-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an earlier rumor by Insider Gaming</a> that Ubisoft Milan is developing a remake of Rayman. As such, it's probably a good idea to expect one of the older games remade for the current generation of hardware rather than a brand new title.</p>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1924835210048290843?t=zXn4Aad3lnqWCuPYQjFefA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Tom Henderson</a>, Ubisoft is preparing to release a Director's Cut of one of its big titles, which could be Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p>
<p>The game launched in December 2023 after over six years of development at Ubisoft Massive. The reception wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 7.5/10 review score from Wccftech reviewer Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a remarkable achievement in many ways, bringing a cinematic world to life on a massive, technically impressive scale like few games have done before. Unfortunately, limited, frustrating combat means the game isn’t always that fun to play once you bump into the RDA. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora’s world is worth experiencing if you’re a fan of James Cameron’s movies, but as the franchise often reminds us, sky people ruin beautiful things.</em></p>
<p>More importantly, it didn't sell as much as Ubisoft was hoping for, especially when accounting for the huge IP it is based on. However, Ubisoft Massive continued to support it after the launch with new features and content such as the two premium DLCs: <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sky Breaker</a> and Secrets of the Spires. Here's an overview of the latter, which launched around six months ago:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Explore and discover a fresh open world, built to elevate the thrill of flying on your banshee.</em></li>
<li><em>Sabotage RDA aerial convoys with new banshee skills and a brand-new mounted weapon.</em></li>
<li><em>Meet a secluded Na'vi clan and join them in their fight against a new RDA threat ravaging the Spires region.</em></li>
<li><em>Get lost in the verticality of this new region, filled with canyons and caves, where unexpected dangers lurk in the shadows.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A Director's Cut of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora would obviously include both, as well as other core improvements, in all likelihood. Of course, Ubisoft's primary motive for releasing the new version would be to ride the hype of the new movie, Fire and Ash, slated to launch in theaters on December 19, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-reaches-3-million-players-7x-faster-than-eternal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, publisher Bethesda Softworks <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages has already reached 3 million players, making it the biggest launch ever in the franchise. For comparison, it was seven times quicker than the previous entry, DOOM Eternal, to get to this milestone.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that Eternal did not launch on Game Pass right away like The Dark Ages. Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda was completed in March 2021, while DOOM Eternal <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was released about a year before</a>. It's always hard to make comparisons between games in the same franchise when the new one is available on Microsoft's subscription service, because it inevitably skews data.</p>
<p>Still, it does seem like the reception has been positive overall. DOOM: The Dark Ages is currently sitting at an 86% average user review score on Steam. Here on Wccftech, resident DOOM expert Chris Wray also gave it an 8.5/10<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in his review</a>:</p>
<p><em>So, to put it all quite simply, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a good game—no, it's a very good game. I would recommend it to fans of the genre and people who want to have fun without the risk of anything transmissible via bodily fluids. Unless we're talking about demon blood and guts, there's lots of that. DOOM: The Dark Ages is yet another success from Id Software, and long may they continue.</em></p>
<p><em>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a rip-tearing fun ride that reigns in some of the excesses of DOOM Eternal, bringing the gameplay closer to DOOM (2016), while adding meat to the story in a long, meaty, campaign across over twenty stages. Put simply, if you liked DOOM and DOOM Eternal, you will like this, even if there are a few minor missteps.</em></p>

<p>In other news, NVIDIA has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game will receive its path tracing update at some point in June. The patch will also add denoising through NVIDIA's DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an interview with Digital Foundry, id Software's Billy Khan <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-not-possible-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> why DOOM: The Dark Ages wouldn't have been possible without ray tracing.</p>
