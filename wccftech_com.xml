            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1887907/Principal-Unreal-Engineer%2C-Gameplay---World's-Edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing posted this week</a>, a new Age of Empires game is in development at World's Edge. This, by itself, is no big surprise, since Microsoft's historic real-time strategy franchise has enjoyed a quiet renaissance in the last few years. Between 2018 and 2024, all previous installments have received their own Definitive Editions and/or remasters, of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> is just the latest. Most of them, especially Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, are still getting new DLC, too.</p>



<p>However, unless they're going for a full-fledged remake of an existing game that was already remastered, chances are this is going to be a brand new game. The biggest surprise from that job listing, though, is that it reveals that the title will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology.</p>



<p><em>At Xbox Game Studios, we are hard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires, our beloved RTS (Real Time Strategy) franchise. We are a passionate group responsible for this amazing franchise and are expanding our team looking for a wonderful colleague that will be responsible for planning and building our future tech stack. We are looking for a Principal Unreal Engineer with background in all aspects of Unreal Engine game development and experience leading external resources.</em></p>



<p>Internet sleuths have also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o3ylx1/more_evidence_about_worlds_edge_studio_behind_age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> the LinkedIn page of World's Edge Principal Build Lead Engineer, which tells us that the team has been developing a triple-A pipeline support for 'unannounced titles using Unreal Engine 5', plural. This particular developer has been with World's Edge since December 2023.</p>



<p>The first candidate is, of course, Age of Empires V. The fourth mainline installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did well enough</a>, receiving several awards for the best strategy game released in 2021. Its fourth expansion, Dynasties of the East, will release on November 4 (the same date as <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-announces-two-titles-coming-to-playstation-5-updates-and-expansions-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's debut on PlayStation 5</a>), adding Golden Horde, Macedonian Dynasty, Sengoku Daimyo, and Tughlaq Dynasty as well as a roguelite single player mode.</p>



<p>Age of Empires IV was developed by Relic Entertainment. As far as we know, World's Edge is not big enough to make a new installment on its own, so it'll be interesting to see if they partner with Relic once again. As a reminder, the Vancouver-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became independent from SEGA in March 2024</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a major update</a> to their Project Amethyst collaboration (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally unveiled in December 2024</a>) this past week in a video featuring PlayStation Lead Architect Mark Cerny and AMD SVP and GM of the Computing and Graphics Group Jack Huynh. The duo presented three major new features, Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression, which will be coming to future AMD GPUs and consoles like Sony's PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>The video was only about nine minutes long, though, and inevitably left viewers with plenty of questions. Thankfully, the folks from Digital Foundry got a few answers from Mark Cerny via an email Q&amp;A and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7dK_X5tnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted them in their latest video</a>, where they also discussed the aforementioned features.</p>



<p>Firstly, when asked about the change in Sony's hardware and software strategy from the PlayStation 5 Pro to the next PlayStation console, Mark Cerny said Project Amethyst would bring about a monumental shift:</p>



<p><em>We've shifted our focus substantially. In the past, we were largely creating custom technologies just for PlayStation platforms. But now with Project Amethyst, we're placing substantially more of a focus on co-engineering and co-development with AMD on their roadmap hardware and libraries. That change will have a very large impact, because when developers can create their technology with the understanding that it will work across multiple platforms such as desktops, laptops, consoles, etc., there will be much larger pickup of new features. So I believe we'll see outsized impact from the technologies announced this past week!</em></p>



<p>Having said that, the PlayStation Lead Architect also admitted that any sort of quantification of the benefits brought by technologies like Universal Compression and Radiance Cores will have to wait until game developers actually implement them in their engines (when it comes to the former) or have access to the new hardware (when it comes to the latter).</p>



<p><em>With these technologies, we know that great stuff is coming but it’s difficult (or impossible) to quantify. For Universal Compression, I have high hopes for synergies with ML, for example, FSR and PSSR are recurrent neural networks that write feature maps to system memory - how well will those feature maps compress? Radiance Cores are similar, they are obviously a great way to do the processing, but I suspect we'Il need to get prototypes into the hands of game developers to understand the degree to which they will be able to “level up their engines.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, in the video announcement, Mark Cerny had stressed that all these features 'only exist in simulation right now', meaning it will take time before developers get to play with them.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The PlayStation Lead Architect also shared a couple more interesting tidbits in the email exchange with Digital Foundry. First, he agreed that Universal Compression is particularly important because it's becoming increasingly complex to achieve significant memory bandwidth increases from generation to generation. Secondly, he confirmed that Sony (and, by extension, AMD) is particularly interested in boosting machine learning and ray tracing for their next hardware compared to regular rasterization, which will get some improvements 'where possible' but is clearly not the focus anymore.</p>



<p>This ties nicely with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/">PlayStation 6 specs rumor</a> that mentioned 'only' a 2.5x to 3x rasterization improvement from the PlayStation 5, whereas ray tracing would be 6x to 12x faster in the new console (which, according to leaker Kepler, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony plans to launch in 2027</a>).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kizuna-encounter-super-tag-battle-interview-%E2%80%93-discussing-4-player-mode-balance-and-future-of-neogeo-premium-selection.1322731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Originally released in 1996, KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE still stands as one of SNK's less popular games . Despite never reaching the mainstream success of other franchises like The King of Fighters, Fatal Fury or Samurai Shodown, its cast of characters, tag mechanics, and distinctive visual design attracted a small, yet passionate cult following. Almost 30 years later, the game has arrived on PC with some brand new features as the second release of the NEOGEO Premium Selection</p>



<p>Before spending some time playing the new KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE release, which made me appreciate the game's unique take on the tag mechanics based on character positioning, I had the chance to talk with producer Laurent&nbsp;Vernézy about the new<strong> </strong>4-player mode, how the developers approached modern balance changes while keeping the spirit of the original intact, and what the future might hold for SNK’s classic arcade catalog.</p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE: This interview was conducted via written Q&amp;A.</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is considered a cult game, its popularity far from that of other SNK franchises like King of Fighters, Fatal Fury and Samurai Shodown. What inspired SNK to bring the game back now as part of the NEOGEO Premium Selection?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> With its charismatic characters, its tag battle mechanics, fast-paced gameplay, and unforgettable soundtrack, we felt KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE would be a great fit to join our brand-new NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION line-up after REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS, which launched a few weeks ago.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you expect the game to be received by a modern audience who never played it before?</p>



<p>A: We are very confident that KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE will be well received by younger audiences as well, due to its iconic characters, soundtrack, and great gameplay.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Were there any lessons learned from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3359900/REAL_BOUT_FATAL_FURY_2_THE_NEWCOMERS/">REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS</a> that influenced the development of this re-release?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS just came out a few weeks ago, so it’s still too early to note anything specific.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the gameplay a faithful recreation of the original arcade release, or was balance changed in some way?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. This premium port of KE STB is 100% faithful to the original title released on NEOGEO in 1996, so the gameplay and character balance is unchanged.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Rollback netcode has become the standard for online play in fighting games. Was it challenging to implement in a classic game?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Implementing rollback netcode in KE STB was not challenging, as it wasn’t the first time we added rollback netplay to our classic fighters. However, adding rollback netcode to a 4-player online game was quite challenging, but everything is ready now for intense online battles!</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is remembered by enthusiasts for its tag-based gameplay, and the new release further leans into it by expanding the 2 v 2 mode with 4-player and 3-player play modes which introduce an interesting twist to traditional online play. How did this idea come about? Was its development challenging?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> We wanted with our developer to ensure that all possibilities of versus tag battles was available in this premium port of KE STB, and we hope players will be happy with them!</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE comes with a hitbox viewer, which is an essential tool to master any fighting game as much as frame data is. Is it accessible in the game? If not, would you consider adding it post-launch if requested by the community?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, this premium version of KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE offers a hitbox viewer feature which is easily accessed through the Practice Mode, and can be toggled on or off.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE makes boss characters playable without any cheat code. Was anything done to make their inclusion in the base roster balanced for competitive play? Boss characters are notoriously overpowered in traditional fighting games.</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> No, nothing was done to change or alter Jyazu and King Leo. They are infamous for being very strong, but as they can’t tag other characters in our out, they’ll have to be careful when choosing one of the boss characters</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Has fighting game community feedback from the launch of REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS influenced the design of the new modes or features?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> No, as REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2 came out only a few weeks ago, it’s still too early to have enough feedback from its launch.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you see KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE potentially finding a place in the modern fighting game competitive scene, even as just a side game at the biggest competitions like EVO?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. There are countless fighting game genres and communities, and we are confident that a lot of young and veteran players will enjoy the return of KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS has yet to launch on consoles, and KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is only launching on PC. Are there plans to bring the NEOGEO Premium Selection to consoles? If so, would cross-platform play be considered?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> We haven’t decided yet if we will expand our NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION line to consoles, but if there is demand for, we will definitely consider it. Nothing has been decided yet regarding adding crossplay or not.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the future plans for the NEOGEO Premium Selection? Will releases be limited to fighting games?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, of course. There will be more rereleases of SNK classics as part of our NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION lineup, and it won’t be limited to classic fighting games.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>



<p>The relaunch of KIZUNA: SUPER TAG BATTLE clearly establishes the NEOGEO Premium Selection as a brand focused on enhanced classic experiences with new features and expanding beyond fighting games. While console plans remain undecided, the quality of this port and its new features only confirm that SNK is taking its arcade legacy seriously.</p>
