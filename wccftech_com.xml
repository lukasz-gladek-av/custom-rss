			<p>USA-based independent developer <strong>ProbablyMonsters</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we recently interviewed</a> about the launch of <strong>Storm Lancers</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>) was featured <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the State of Play broadcast</a> with an interesting new game called <strong>Crimson Moon</strong>. It's an action/adventure roleplaying game with optional co-op with another player. The setting is "<strong>Gothic High Renaissance</strong>"; the protagonist is a half-human, half-angel <strong>Nephilim</strong> born of a forbidden union and sworn to protect humanity as a <strong>Knight of the Crimson Moon</strong>.</p>



<p>The game takes place in <strong>Gildenarch</strong>, a once grand metropolis <strong>now overrun by the Infernal Legion</strong> and a corruption known as "<strong>Hellgrowth</strong>". As players reclaim the city district by district, they will uncover the secrets behind the titular Order of the Crimson Moon and the city's fall. The narrative culminates in a high-stakes confrontation with <strong>Solomon Moore</strong>, a sinister vampire lord who engineered Gildenarch's demise.</p>



<p>The gameplay loop is built around <strong>intense, replayable missions</strong> rather than a continuous open world. Players embark on <strong>15 to 45-minute "runs" into the demon-infested street</strong>s, where dynamic maps and evolving enemy compositions ensure that no two incursions feel the same. Combat is described as <strong>fast, visceral, and "Souls-inspired,"</strong> emphasizing mastery and skill expression with parries and finishers. As a Nephilim, <strong>players can wield divine abilities and unleash explosive celestial transformations</strong> to instantly reshape the battlefield.</p>



<p>Between missions, players will return to the <strong>Sanctus Clypeus</strong> (the Church's headquarters), a living hub where they can upgrade persistent stats, craft gear at the Blacksmith, and interact with various non-playable characters (NPCs) before planning their next move at the War Table.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, Crimson Moon <strong>features optional co-op</strong> that is designed to amplify the game's intensity. Cooperative play <strong>unlocks unique synergies,</strong> allowing players to combine abilities for devastating attacks and revive one another when overwhelmed by the Hellgrowth. The game utilizes <strong>dynamic difficulty scaling</strong> to keep the challenge high regardless of the group size.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest surprises of <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a> was undoubtedly the announcement of <strong>Project Windless</strong>. An open world action RPG in development at <strong>KRAFTON Montréal</strong>, it is based on the "<strong>The Bird That Drinks Tears</strong>" fantasy universe created by the Korean novelist <strong>Lee Youngdo</strong>, which has been described as "<strong>The Korean Lord of the Rings</strong>".  <strong>Patrik Méthé</strong>, Head of KRAFTON Montréal Studio and Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world. For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. Project Windless is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play.</em></p>



<p>Project Windless is technically <strong>a prequel set 1,500 years before the events narrated in Youngdo's books</strong>, a common choice for game developers whenever they want to draw from lore while maintaining complete creative freedom. The story will focus on the origins of the "<strong>Hero King</strong>," the legendary founder of the <strong>Aragit Kingdom</strong>. The setting features four unique races:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Tokabi:</strong> Tricksters who wield fire and magic, known for laughing in the face of death.</li>



<li><strong>The Humans:</strong> Ambitious and strategic, constantly vying to shift the balance of power.</li>



<li><strong>The Naga:</strong> A cold-blooded and brilliant reptilian race, driven by a ruthless desire for domination.</li>



<li><strong>The Rekkon:</strong> The bird-like playable race. Fierce, nomadic warriors of immense size and speed, driven by a singular "life wish."</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6NK4164iY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the first developer diary</a>, KRAFTON Montréal, which is working alongside KRAFTON teams based in teams in Pangyo, South Korea, to ensure authenticity, <strong>the combat was described as brutal, visceral, and overwhelming</strong>. In the lore, Rekkon warriors have immense strength, so <strong>players will often face dozens or even hundreds of enemies simultaneously</strong>. To achieve this scale, the team behind Project Windless is using a new "<strong>Mass Entity AI</strong>" technology. This system allows for the simulation of hundreds or thousands of smart, reactive characters. The goal is to transform standard encounters into unpredictable, large-scale conflicts that simulate the feel of a world truly torn by war.</p>



<p>Project Windless is being developed as a <strong>premium single player experience for PC and consoles</strong>. There's no release window in sight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill: Townfall Gets Debut Gameplay, Is a First-Person Game Set in Scotland]]></title>

			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a>, <strong>KONAMI</strong> and <strong>Annapurna Interactive</strong> have unveiled the first gameplay trailer for <strong>Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>. The spin-off psychological horror game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced back in 2022</a></strong>, and this is the first time we learn anything concrete about it. Meanwhile, the development team, originally known as <strong>No Code</strong> (the same ones behind <strong>Stories Untold</strong> and <strong>Observation</strong>), has rebranded to <strong>Screen Burn</strong>.</p>



<p>More information was revealed in the subsequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Transmission</a>, where the game was described as a full-length, self-contained adventure <strong>set in cold Scotland</strong> and <span><strong>played entirely in first-person</strong>, marking</span> a significant shift from the series' usual third-person perspective.</p>



<p>Writer and director <strong>Jon McKellan</strong> said:</p>



<p><em>Our main objectives were to make a game that could feel specific to the team who made it, to bring something new to the series in terms of setting and to really think about what Silent Hill, both in concept and gameplay, could look like through a Screen Burn lens.</em></p>



<p>According to Screen Burn, <strong>the first-person perspective fundamentally reshapes how players experience Silent Hill's horror</strong>. Lead Game Designer <strong>Graeme McKellan</strong> emphasized that the limited field of view creates tension through what happens off-screen, noting that <strong>what happens off-screen is sometimes even scarier than what happens right in front of the player</strong>.</p>



<p>Combat offers familiar tools to players, such as planks of wood, pipes, and firearms, but also introduces meaningful choices between confrontation and evasion. <strong>A peeking gameplay mechanic allows the protagonist, Simon Ordell, to lean carefully around corners and over walls</strong>, assessing threats before committing to action. </p>



<p>Screen Burn's signature analog technology aesthetic manifests in the CRTV, <strong>a handheld pocket television that reimagines Silent Hill's iconic radio</strong>. Players physically bring up the device and manually tune through frequencies to discover narrative content and detect enemy positions. Graeme McKellan added:</p>



<p><em>We really wanted the player to bring it up and actually use it. The analog tech, that's kind of been my visual calling card. Most of the things we've done, even in our previous games, has been as close to real-life technology as we can get.</em></p>



<p>The developers have described the main character of Silent Hill: Townfall as a <strong>layered, uncertain, and deeply human being</strong> who returns to the island town of St. Amelia after receiving a mysterious phone call asking him to come to the island and put things to rest.</p>



<p>Jon McKellan confirmed <strong>guilt serves as a central theme</strong>, explored through different manifestations: </p>



<p><em>Guilt is a strong theme throughout Silent Hill's many stories, and I wanted to dive deeper into the various different ways that guilt can manifest. Where it comes from, what it can do to people, and how, if you can, come to accept or resolve it. </em></p>



<p>The narrative <strong>maintains Screen Burn's signature mystery-driven storytelling</strong>, with players gradually uncovering both small details and major reveals as they meet other characters whose connections to Simon prove crucial. Some mysteries resolve as the game progresses, while others will only deepen, <strong>inviting players to explore every corner of the town</strong>. </p>



<p>The inspiration for St. Amelia <strong>draws heavily from real locations along Scotland's east coast, particularly fishing villages like St Monans</strong>. The development team conducted extensive location scouting, capturing not just visuals but the atmosphere, smell, wind, and sound of these coastal settlements.</p>



<p>A key inspiration came from the so-called <strong>Haar</strong>, a dense fog that rolls in along Scotland's east coast. Jon McKellan recalled an early research trip where the fog became so thick that he and his brother lost sight of the coast and couldn't determine which direction it was. The fog is, of course, a fundamental element of mystery in the whole series, so <strong>it was a perfect fit for Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>, too.</p>



<p>Screen Burn <strong>only employs around 30 developers</strong>, but this is still going to be a full-length game, and publisher Annapurna Interactive said <strong>it's going to be one of the biggest games they've published yet</strong>.</p>
