			<p>VOID Interactive's tactical FPS Ready or Not will be arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles sometime this coming summer 2025, the studio announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ready or Not puts you in the boots of modern-day SWAT teams sent into hostile situations where you are trying not to pull the trigger as often as possible, and take culprits alive by following proper rules of engagement. Running in with your guns blazing is a fast track to mission failure, which is where the tactical side of Ready or Not's gameplay comes in.</p>
<p>First released in Early Access in December 2021, Ready or Not launched its full 1.0 version two years later in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/">December 2023</a>. Now, a little more than a year after that launch, it is nearly ready to make its console debut.</p>
<p>A new trailer for Ready or Not was shown during the Galaxies Showcase 2025 event, which you can see below.</p>

<p>VOID Interactive has been on a long journey with Ready or Not, first announcing the game back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-swat/">2017</a>. It's also had its fair share of issues along the way, like being temporarily removed from Steam due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-was-temporarily-removed-from-steam-due-to-trademark-infringement/">trademark infringement</a> and the controversy surrounding a level in the game depicting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-top-selling-game-ready-or-not-has-its-devs-commenting-on-planned-school-shooting-level/">bomb threat at a school</a>, which prompted a <a href="https://x.com/VOIDInteractive/status/1474203773878816778">statement</a> from the development team.</p>
<p>Neither issue has stopped Ready or Not from achieving a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam across 180,000+ user reviews. It'll be interesting to see how console players take to it, and anyone interested can rush to their device to wishlist the game now.</p>

			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ubisoft-is-developing-a-new-battle-royale-heavily-inspired-by-apex-legends/">Insider-Gaming</a>, Ubisoft has another live service game in development following its shutdown of XDefiant, which will be gone forever this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">June 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The report claims that this game will be a battle royale and is currently in development under the codename "Scout. "One of Insider-Gaming's sources says that "<em>I think the goal is to capitalize on the player count of Apex dropping and them [Ubisoft higher-ups] thinking there's room in the market for another hero Battle Royale.</em>"</p>
<p>This, of course, isn't Ubisoft's first crack at adding another successful live service title to its portfolio. Rainbow Six is arguably the most significant live service success it has, but that's still a paid title, and not a free-to-play game. Ubisoft's track record is very different in terms of its free-to-play successes.</p>
<p>Out of its current free-to-play offerings, it is easy to imagine that Brawlhalla is the most successful, though Ubisoft's longest-running free-to-play game is the PC-only MMO sandbox Growtopia. Last year's summer release, Battle Core Arena, Rocksmith+, Roller Champions, Trackmania, and Rabbids Coding are also listed on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/games/free">Ubisoft's website</a> as part of its free-to-play lineup. If these games are doing amazingly well for Ubisoft, the company certainly isn't discussing those successes.</p>
<p>Of course, XDefiant used to be on that list, but it was long removed after last year's closing announcements. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hyper-scape/">Hyper Scape</a> is another free-to-play title that, just like XDefiant, didn't last. Right now, it's difficult to see whatever this project Scout ends up becoming, having a different fate than either XDefiant or Hyper Scape.</p>
<p>Battle royales are also not the new, exciting genre they once were in the free-to-play, live service world. Sure, the biggest ones are still very popular. No one is dethroning Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, or PUBG anytime soon. If anything, you could argue that XDefiant's attempt at bringing back an old-school flavor of multiplayer was what had a better shot at breaking through the live service ceiling.</p>
<p>If Ubisoft had let the game run for at least a calendar year and supported it differently, XDefiant might have ended up on the rise after the drop-off from its launch success. If this rumored project makes it to PCs and consoles, we'll see if Ubisoft is willing to give it that chance.</p>
