			<p>As <a href="https://x.com/NeonGiantGames/status/1995417593407050185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> in the past few days, Swedish developer Neon Giant, known for 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ascent-qa-neon-giant-shares-info-on-game-length-crossplay-and-the-games-living-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ascent</a>, has revealed a new game called NO LAW during <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. While The Ascent was an isometric twin-stick shooter, though, this upcoming game is a first-person open world shooter roleplaying game that, at least on the surface, is highly reminiscent of CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, players take on the role of Grey Harker, a former soldier who has left his war-torn past behind in favour of a quiet life tending to his plants, until trouble finds him again. When his peace is shattered by violence, Harker must rely on his black-ops instincts and customised equipment to reclaim what was stolen and confront the city that wronged him.</p>



<p>Set against the backdrop of the sprawling port city of Port Desire, carved into the cliffs above a restless sea, the game invites players to explore a neon-sleazy world where regulation is absent. This vibrant metropolis is a hub of import and excess, teeming with colourful characters whose motives are as murky as the smog-filled skyline. Every inch of Port Desire, from the rooftop gardens to the alleys below, is alive and reactive, waiting to be shaped by the player's choices.</p>



<p>Every decision carries weight, according to Neon Giant. Should you help a friend in need or silence an enemy permanently? Should you take the tactical route through the shadows or unleash chaos in open combat? Even in a city without laws, actions have consequences. Each playthrough promises new possibilities, allies and outcomes, making NO LAW an immersive shooter that is as much defined by its story and morality as by its firepower.</p>

<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, NO LAW blends visceral first-person combat with deep player agency. Whether the player favours precision, stealth or destruction, their approach will define the in-game experience. Players can master advanced military upgrades, experiment with sci-fi tools and vertical movement, and transform every mission into their own tale of revenge, consequence and survival.</p>



<p>Claës af Burén, Managing Director at Neon Giant, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>NO LAW represents the next step for us as a studio. With The Ascent, we built a strong foundation for how we approach worldbuilding, systems, and storytelling. This new project takes everything we’ve learned and applies it to a completely different kind of experience — one that’s bigger, more reactive, and more personal than anything we’ve done before.</em></p>



<p>The game, which will be published by Krafton (the Korean studio acquired Neon Giant in 2022), is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. It can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161710/NO_LAW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, where we found the recommended system requirements.

			<p>Former Criterion developers who worked on series like Need for Speed and Burnout at Fuse Games have announced a different kind of fast-paced arcade racer at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> with Star Wars: Galactic Racer, a game that doesn't seem to entirely rely on pod racing with a mix of pods and classic speeders, arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>Developed by Fuse Games and published by Secret Mode, Star Wars: Galactic Racer was the second Star Wars game to be revealed at The Game Awards tonight, and is the sixth Star Wars game in development that we know about.</p>



<p>Compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">Star Wars Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kotor-remake-developer-revealed-full-kotor-ii-remake-also-planned/">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-a-single-player-rpg-spiritual-successor-to-knights-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic (the other newly announced Star Wars game)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-clone-wars-and-due-next-year/">Star Wars Zero Company</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">the third Star Wars Jedi game</a>, Galactic Racer appears to be bringing a bit more variety to the Star Wars games we have to look forward to.</p>

<p>"<em>For us, </em><em>Star Wars</em> has always represented the power of wonder—and <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> is one of its most thrilling expressions," said Matt Webster, chief executive officer at Fuse Games, in a press release. "<em>With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, we wanted to reinvent what a racing game can be: adventurous, spectacular and exhilarating. We want every race to feel alive with dynamic risk-reward choices, and every victory to feel incredible</em>."</p>



<p>Vice president and general manager at Lucasfilm, Douglas Reilly, added, "<em>From the beginning, Star Wars has drawn inspiration from racing culture, from podracing to high-speed chases across the galaxy. With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, the team at Fuse Games has captured that spirit and elevated it into a wholly new form of racing adventure. We can't wait for fans to experience it.</em>"</p>



<p>You'll be able to build and customize your ride as you join the Galactic League to rise from your state as a lone racer in the Outer Rim to a household name among racing fans across the galaxy. It's a runs-based racing game "<em>where no two runs are the same</em>." </p>
