			<p>Embark Studios has revealed and launched Season 8 for The Finals, bringing new enhancements to the in-game destruction that helped make the game popular in the first place, two new weapons that players have been waiting for, and more.</p>



<p>Season 8, titled Game Time, adds what Embark Studios is calling "<em>Smooth Destruction</em>" to The Finals. Per a press release from Embark Studios, you'll now see elements in-game like "<em>cranes cutting through buildings and suspended structures reacting more realistically with massive impact</em>."</p>



<p>The two new weapons coming to The Finals in Season 8 are a P90 SMG for the Medium class and a BFR Revolver for the Heavy class. The P90 is especially significant for The Finals, since it's the first SMG being introduced to the Medium class, and will likely have a major impact on the game's meta.</p>



<p>Embark Studios also debuted a new trailer for Season 8 of The Finals, showing off the new destruction elements and the new weapons. </p>

<p>Other quality-of-life improvements in Season 8 include the addition of an instant replay that show what your opponent saw during an intense moment, the arrival of mouse and keyboard controls for players on consoles, and a new match recap landing page that is meant to give you more detailed and easy-to-read stats from your previous match.</p>



<p>And of course, there will also be a new battle pass for players to work through in Season 8 with a slew of cosmetics to grab, including a few new cosmetic areas that can help you stand out even more when jumping into the arena.</p>
