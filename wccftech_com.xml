			<p>In yet another <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">unionization effort within the last seven days</a>, this time on the north side of the North American border, 74% of the Ubisoft Halifax team voted in favour of a wall-to-wall union and have joined the CWA Canada Local 30111, alongside <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">Bethesda Game Studios Montreal</a> and the Montreal Gazette staff. </p>



<p>The news was announced with a press release on the <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">CWA Canada website</a>, with the move adding 60 Ubisoft Halifax staff to Local 30111. Altogether, the staff represent several branches at the studio, including <em>"producers, programmers, designers, artists, researchers, and development testers</em>."</p>



<p>In a mission statement, the studio calls the union a move one made "<em>not in opposition to Ubisoft, but in partnership, with the goal of ensuring our studio remains a beacon of equity, excellence, and innovation</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>In an era marked by industry-wide uncertainty,</em> <em>studio closures, layoffs, and increasing instability, we want to make clear our commitment to one another and to our craft</em>," the statement reads. "<em>We believe that creativity flourishes when workers feel secure, supported, and empowered</em>."</p>



<p>The most recent studio to vote in favour of a wall-to-wall union was id Software, with 165 developers joining the CWA just last Friday, December 12. 2025 has also seen the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZeniMax Workers QA union finally reach a deal with Microsoft</a> after two years of negotiating, another <a href="https://wccftech.com/450-diablo-developers-vote-in-favor-unionizing-cwa/">450 Diablo developers voting in favour of unionization</a>, and nearly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">200 developers from the Overwatch 2 team at Blizzard voting for unionization</a>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft Halifax is right to call out the uncertainty lurking in the industry. Microsoft, the defacto biggest publisher in the industry and one of the three big console manufacturers, has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-denies-report-it-could-have-shut-down-xbox-business-in-2021/">denied reports that it would shut down the entire Xbox platform</a>. But with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">number of layoffs Microsoft has had in its gaming division</a>, it's understandable why people would even ask the question, and it's not a great sign for the industry to be in a place where people are earnestly asking this question.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has had three instances of layoffs this year. First, in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">January 2025, at its Ubisoft Leamington studio in the UK</a>, followed by layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Trials developer Ubisoft Redlynx</a>, and layoffs at The Division, Star Wars Outlaws, and Frontiers of Pandora developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive Entertainment</a>.</p>



<p>Now that the team has voted in favour of unionizing, the studio will begin to negotiate a contract with Ubisoft. "<em>Now let’s get to work negotiating a first collective agreement that recognizes the talent and dedication of these workers</em>," said CWA Canada president, Carmel Smyth.</p>



<p>CWA Canada has also been active elsewhere in the country, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/12/cwa-canada-urges-competition-bureau-to-scrutinize-55-billion-electronic-arts-buyout/">calling on Competition Bureau Canada</a> to closely scrutinize <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">EA's buyout deal</a> to ensure it protects Canadian developers and consumers from a labour and security perspective, and organizing a protest outside of Rockstar Toronto in solidarity with the 34 workers fired from Rockstar this past October. </p>



<p>Since that continent-spanning dismissal, with 31 workers fired across the UK and three in Toronto, Rockstar has been accused of union-busting, though the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">denies the accusations and claims the fired workers had been</a> <em>"discussing and distributing confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Wccftech attended the protest to speak to those demonstrating, and also talked with one of the three workers fired from Toronto</a>. The CWA Canada representatives who organized the protest, and the fired worker, both say that all the workers were doing was discussing their working conditions and organizing efforts in a private, employees-only and union-representatives-only Discord server. </p>



<p>"<em></em><em>The official story from management is that they were, quote unquote, leaking sensitive information</em>," said Nasr Ahmed, one of the CWA Canada representatives who organized the protest. "<em></em><em>But we know that this is patently false.</em> <em> They [Rockstar] have not provided any proof for these claims,</em>  <em>either for the Canadian workers or the UK workers. At the end of the day, discussing workers' rights and discussing working conditions is not against the law as far as I know, in either Canada or in the UK, which is exactly what these workers were doing.</em>"</p>



<p>One of the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto said that "<em></em><em>We were there mostly to talk about working conditions. Sometimes we would socialize, but the only reason we would ever be there was to discuss working conditions among the studio. I will also mention that we had a very thorough vetting process</em>."</p>



<p>They also added, "<em></em><em>We just want to get back to work on the game. We poured our heart and soul into</em> <em>it, and to be let go just for discussing our working conditions amongst ourselves and wanting the company to be better, it's heartbreaking</em>."</p>

			<p>Although the Halo series has faced some challenges lately, it's undeniable that the franchise remains one of the most popular modern gaming series ever. Halo Studios is well aware of the current general perception of their series, and by reportedly <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"giving the Covenant back their bomb"</em>, and remaking Halo 2 and Halo 3, it wants to ensure the franchise's new era doesn't fail with a new game whose reception is uncertain.</p>



<p>Well-known<span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">&nbsp;and reliable series insider&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Rebs Gaming</strong></a>&nbsp;took a close look at the c</span>urrent series rumors, which claim that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-2-3-remakes-in-the-works-halo-7-multiplayer-experience/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remakes of the second and third entries in the series</strong></a> will follow next year's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong></a>, providing some additional information&nbsp;straight from reliable sources, including an alleged former developer.</p>



<p>Hints that a Halo 2 remake could be coming in the future were already discovered back in April 2024, when Dan Gniady joined Halo Studios and later added the iconic <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfD9WbdXoI8"><strong>"Giving the Covenant back their bomb"</strong></a></em> quote from the game to their LinkedIn profile. </p>



<p>A few months later, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/TechnicalHalo"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">big baby beluga (TechnicalHalo)</strong></a> revealed correct information on the Campaign Evolved remake one year before its official announcement, proving they had access to insider information. This insider also claimed that remakes of the second and third entries in the series were planned, as the studio reportedly believed that reselling the series on new platforms, rather than porting the Master Chief Collection, had higher revenue potential.</p>



<p>As they say, where there's smoke, there's fire, and it seems like these remakes are, at the very least, being planned. Rebs Gaming claims to have spoken with a former Halo Studios developer who said that Halo 2 and 3 are being remade, but couldn't share more due to an NDA. </p>



<p>Even so, in terms of scope, these two remakes shouldn't be too different from Campaign Evolved, doing away with their multiplayer components and keeping faithful to the originals' stories, although they may not stick to the original endpoints. Additionally, the two remakes are expected to launch from the same game or hub.</p>



<p>In addition, a reliable source backed up Rebs Gaming assumption that <em>"Microsoft and Halo Studios leadership wants to ensure that Halo’s new era doesn’t fail by playing it safe and avoiding risks. Specifically, they want to avoid making another new Halo game that is heavily criticized by the OG Halo fans. So they’re playing it safe by remaking the original games because they can’t afford to fail again and the original Halo games were very successful and many people still play them."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As Halo Studios is focusing on Halo: Campaign Evolved, it will be a while before we learn if the all classic entries in the series will be remade at some point. Still, considering the rift that opened between the community and the series with the launch of Halo 4 and continued to widen with the following games, it makes quite a bit of sense to begin the new era by returning to the games that fans love, building a solid foundation upon which future new entries in the series could stand.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samson Will Feature Elements from Mad Max and Just Cause; Main Story to Last 10 Hours, Side Content Bumps That to 25]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/samson-will-feature-elements-mad-max-just-cause-main-story-10-hours-bump-to-25/</link>
            <guid>1388029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> of <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong> at the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 Showcase, developer Liquid Swords has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3634520/view/524236943144256435?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a detailed FAQ</a> on what players can expect in the game.</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established Liquid Swords</a>, the studio confirmed that there will be elements inspired by two of that team's most renowned titles: Mad Max and Just Cause. When it comes to the latter, Just Cause players will recognize an emphasis on physicality, momentum, and emergent systems interaction, although Samson won't feature an exaggerated spectacle and chaos for its own sake, opting for a more grounded approach instead. As for Mad Max, this new game reminds it with its heavy, personal melee combat as well as the vehicle combat mechanics, although of course there are many differences due purely to the setting. </p>



<p>Beyond the comparisons with those games, Samson's combat, whether on foot or on a vehicle, rejects stylization in favor of functional, purposeful violence. Rather than accessing predetermined weapon loadouts, players will utilize environmental tools (wrenches, tires, brick piles, to name a few) and create opportunities through improvisation. There's a large variety of melee weapons and these can be stored in vehicle trunks for tactical preparation, but the surroundings always provide immediate alternatives. Damage carries visual and mechanical weight; impacts break environmental elements and visibly mark both the player character and enemies.</p>



<p>Driving is a key component of Samson. Liquid Swords stressed that vehicle handling emphasizes weight, impact, and physical sensation, with intentional differentiation between vehicle types. Players can drive any vehicle they find, although strangely, the developers explicitly mentioned that civilians won't be removed from the vehicles, unlike in Grand Theft Auto. That seems to suggest the player character would be effectively kidnapping them, too, although that is unconfirmed at the moment. Of course, stealing will elicit a response from law enforcement that escalates further based on the player's actions. But other NPCs react, too, responding differently to aggression (fighting back or fleeing).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Samson_Car_Chase-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Samson is priced at just <strong>$24.99</strong>, so it makes sense that the main narrative would be relatively short. While the game offers freedom to explore the open world, the experience won't be virtually endless, focusing instead on missions and the overarching story (Samson's attempt to pay off his debt as the clock goes against him). Indeed, Liquid Swords confirmed it should take around <strong>10 hours</strong>, but side content can bump that to approximately <strong>25 hours</strong>. These include vehicle-based jobs such as high-stakes hits, underground races, and daring getaways, as well as theft, hand-to-hand combat, and tailing missions to gather critical information. Completing these jobs will contribute to the player progression system, which includes skills and perks that support various playstyles.</p>



<p>There won't be any difficulty settings, so players will have to experience the game's level of challenge as it was intended by the creators. Finally, Liquid Swords acknowledged the challenges of optimizing an open world game, but claimed that they have been working on it since the beginning and also received the support of Epic Games (Samson is powered by Unreal Engine 5).</p>



<p>The objective is to launch in early 2026 on PC, with console versions following later due to the team's small size.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Rest for the Wicked Together Co-Op Update Launches January 22, 2026, But You Can Test It Now]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-updates-launches-january-22-2026/</link>
            <guid>1388002</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Independent developer Moon Studios (known for the Ori franchise) unveiled the launch date of <strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong>, the long-awaited online co-op update for the action RPG currently in early access, during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIqY6Sszcw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Wicked Inside' livestream</a>. The patch will go live on <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, but you can test it right now thanks to a limited time Open Beta test that runs through Monday, December 22. </p>



<p>The developers have introduced the co-op implementation as a response to the structural limitations inherent in contemporary action RPG multiplayer modes. According to Moon Studios founder and CEO Thomas Mahler, each of the current modes, like host-guest, adding random players, or summoning them FromSoftware-style, fails because they lack "the feeling that we think most players always desire to have when playing an RPG together with others."</p>



<p>The design the studio settled on is, instead, a combination of the systemic depth and meaningful personal interaction of traditional ARPGs with the persistent, shared-world architecture of MMORPGs, while avoiding the subscription requirements and always-online dependencies of the latter. The ambitious goal is to evoke "the magical feeling of playing your very first D&amp;D campaign".</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, No Rest for the Wicked Together operates through <strong>persistent shared realms</strong>. When a player first creates a realm and invites friends, that realm becomes permanently accessible, independent of any host's connection status. This is akin to Minecraft's realm model. Up to four players can simultaneously inhabit a specific realm. With this structure, one player may undertake quests solo while companions are offline, and their actions remain visible upon their friends' eventual return. <strong>Community chests</strong> serve as asynchronous trading mechanisms, which is particularly valuable when fellow players have different playing schedules. </p>



<p>Moreover, rather than individuals owning separate residences, the party collectively purchases a shared home and establishes granular permissions: full access for some chests, private storage for others, shared crafting tables and refineries available to all members. Moon Studios also confirmed that the Crucible, the roguelike area that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-update-revamps-crucible-improves-combat-and-adds-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally revamped shortly after the early access debut</a>, supports full cooperative play. When it comes to combat, the developers warned that enemies and bosses in multiplayer get new AI behaviours, so they may require tactical adjustments to be defeated.</p>



<p>While No Rest for the Wicked Together is clearly focused on co-op multiplayer functionality, the patch will also introduce various improvements that will be equally interesting to those who prefer to play solo. For example, higher-tier items now guarantee superior enchantment rolls with increased slot quantities; weapons now possess random critical strike chances; all enemies now support backstab mechanics; the bows' projectile behavior now fundamentally changes based on the equipped quiver type; the hardest difficulty tier introduces higher enemy density, based on community feedback.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>No Rest for the Wicked launched in <strong>April 2024</strong> on early access and immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed a lot of potential</a>.  However, it didn't quite achieve the same level of success the studio had hoped for. Even though SteamDB suggests sales are between a million and a million and a half units, Moon Studios founder and CEO Thomas Mahler issued a desperate plea to its community, asking for help to improve the Steam user review score, although he later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> that the studio was not actually in immediate danger of closing down.</p>



<p>The game still doesn't have a launch window for version 1.0. When the full game launches, Moon Studios plans to release it on consoles as well, although they <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-might-initially-skip-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while back</a> that Xbox might be skipped due to 'market conditions' (the platform's declining sales). No Rest for the Wicked is currently 30% off as part of the Steam Winter Sale, by the way.</p>
