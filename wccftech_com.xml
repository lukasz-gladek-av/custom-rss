			<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> hosted its final spotlight announcement in its <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">flurry of spotlight showcases</a> over the past two weeks with the <strong><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243862/catch-up-on-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight?_gl=1*1cph9zv*_gcl_au*MzgxMDg5NjM0LjE3NzAyMzQyMjQ.*_ga*MTM2NDczNzMwMi4xNzY4MjM1Nzgw*_ga_VYKNV7C0S3*czE3NzA4NzAyMDgkbzUkZzEkdDE3NzA4NzEyNzYkajU2JGwwJGgw">Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight</a></strong>, a peek into everything coming to the <strong>Diablo</strong> franchise in the coming milestone year. Like previous spotlights for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-dropping-the-2-overwatch-2-is-now-just-called-overwatch-moving-forward/">Overwatch,</a></strong> and <strong>Hearthstone</strong>, plenty was left off today's agenda to be revealed at <strong>BlizzCon 2026</strong>. But we now know of one major element that's coming to <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, <strong>Diablo Immortal</strong>, and <strong>Diablo II: Resurrected</strong>: <strong>Warlocks.</strong></p>



<p>The Warlock class is being added to all three aforementioned titles, the most significant of which perhaps is its inclusion in Diablo II: Resurrected, since this is the first new playable class Diablo II has gotten in <strong>25 years</strong>. Each game is getting its own version of a Warlock class, though the only version that's currently playable right now, is the one in Diablo II: Resurrected. That update was shadow-dropped as part of today's spotlight, which you can check out in full below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It was a tight <strong>39 minutes</strong> of news and reveals for the long-running action RPG franchise, capped off with Diablo IV game director <strong>Brent Gibson</strong> teasing that players will <em>"freak</em>" when they reveal more of what's coming at BlizzCon 2026, though the video comically cuts before he spoils the surprise.</p>



<p>As for what is coming to the franchise, starting with Diablo II: Resurrected, which saw its Warlock go live today, this remaster of one of the most beloved action-RPG titles ever doesn't just get a new class for the first time in over two decades. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>That change is why Blizzard will still keep the vanilla, sans-Warlock version of Diablo II: Resurrected available for those who want it. That means when you boot up Diablo II: Resurrected, you'll be given the option of jumping into the game that Blizzard released in 2021, or <strong>Diablo II: Reign of the Warlock</strong>.</p>



<p>Reign of the Warlock is a new paid expansion for Diablo II: Resurrected, which will cost you <strong>$25</strong> if you want to check out the first new class to arrive in Diablo II for 25 years. At least several of the updates mentioned in the spotlight today aren't behind a paywall, with the main draw being the new class.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players can also enjoy updated terror zones, the introduction of <strong>Colossal Ancients</strong>, new quality-of-life updates like new loot filters and updated stash tabs, the introduction of The Chronicle to keep better track of your loot, and new items and runewords.</p>



<p>Diablo Immortal players will have the wait the longest to get their hands on the Warlock class, as it's not scheduled to arrive until sometime in <strong>June 2026.</strong> For now, the studio did reveal a roadmap for the full year, with new quests, gear, bosses, new endgame PvE challenges, zone events, subzones, and more, all set to arrive before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Lastly, Diablo IV players also have some waiting to do to learn more about the Warlock they'll be getting to play as when the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred-expansion-release-date/">Lord of Hatred</a></strong> expansion arrives on <strong>April 28, 2026.</strong> Blizzard will host another spotlight event on <strong>March 5, 2026,</strong> which will be digging into the Warlock class, showcasing its strength and abilities in action.</p>



<p>The new expansion will also include a reignited endgame experience with the introduction of <strong>War Plans</strong>, which lets you decide what kind of endgame you want. You'll be able to create a playlist of activities based on what you want to do, choosing from six endgame modes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Pit</li>



<li>Infernal Hordes</li>



<li>Heltides</li>



<li>Nightmare Dungeons</li>



<li>Lair Bosses</li>



<li>Kurast Undercity</li>
</ul>



<p>Depending on what rewards you hope to return with and what kind of experience you want, you'll curate your endgame between five of those options, earning progression points in a unique endgame skill tree. Diablo IV will also get a new "<em>hyper-rare</em>" endurance event, <strong>Echoing Hatred</strong>, which bombards you with enemy waves until you die, earning more and better loot the longer you can survive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's happened again. <strong>Highguard</strong>, the latest free-to-play live service first-person shooter to enter the fray, this time from developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment,</strong> a team made up of former <strong>Apex Legends</strong> and <strong>Titanfall 2</strong> developers, launched just two weeks ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/">January 26, 2026.</a></strong> Today, <strong>February 11, 2026,</strong> a little more than two weeks since launch, the studio confirmed it had a round of <strong>layoffs.</strong></p>



<p>Individual developers across multiple branches, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427501095955914752/?ref=aftermath.site">principal</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427500304054693890/?ref=aftermath.site">senior</a> members of staff, shared the news on their LinkedIn accounts before the studio made a statement of its own on the official Wildlight Entertainment X (formerly Twitter) account.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game</em>," the studio's statement begins. "<em>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful for our players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be part of our community</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful…</p></div>— Wildlight Entertainment (@WildlightEnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Though Wildlight doesn't provide an exact figure, at least two of the developers who shared they had been impacted described it as "<em><strong>most</strong></em><strong>"<em> </em></strong>of the team getting cut, with all of their statements really driving home the tragedy of the situation.</p>



<p>"<em>Today I was laid off from my job at Wildlight along with most of the staff</em>," writes lead tech artist, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427497173774225409/?ref=aftermath.site">Josh Sobel</a></strong>. "<em>It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before. I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ years for anything. <strong>I'm still spinning</strong>, and I won't be in a place to start thinking about the future for a while, but please keep me in mind if, in the near future, you're looking for a senior or higher level rigger</em>."</p>



<p>It's clear that Highguard did not land how Wildlight wanted it to. The studio leadership's decision to slot it into <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> with a trailer that, unfortunately, did not properly convey what the game is to players, followed by complete silence, into an attempt at making it a shadow-dropped hit left players with nothing but confusion going into it and a skeptical approach when servers were turned on.</p>



<p>Once the game was live and a few of the game's more glaring cracks were shown, those who tuned in at launch dropped it like a lead balloon. The studio's leaders <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">apologized for how the launch was handled</a> while players on Steam were relentless, showering Highguard with negative reviews.</p>



<p>To the studio's credit, it acted quickly to try and address player feedback, <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412">adding a 5v5 mode</a> to ratchet up the intensity as players complained about boring matches, but that hasn't turned things around fast enough for Wildlight's leadership and bean counters. The only thing that has changed about Highguard in an instant is the size of the team working on it, which ultimately only makes it more difficult for the studio to try and put a better foot forward than what they brought to launch.</p>



<p>Sobel isn't the only one who describes their team or their time at Wildlight with such high praise, and it all makes you wonder why this keeps happening. Why studios are spun up and formed in a way that is continually deemed to be unsustainable without serious cuts to the only thing of real value a new studio has: its team.</p>



<p>It's not impossible for Wildlight to turn things around. We've seen studios do it before. But it is now beyond tiring to still see studios invest so much effort, time, and money in games where everything rests on the hope that it'll be the next <strong>Fortnite</strong>, and if it doesn't hit that mark right away, cut to plan B of laying off as many people as possible and hope you can become the next <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-remnant-update-adds-gravity-manipulation/">No Man's Sky</a></strong>.</p>
