			<p>Destiny: Rising is a new mobile title from developer and publisher NetEase, licensed by Bungie, and it's due out in just 10 days from the time of this writing. It was first announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">October 2024</a>, and since then the hype around it for mobile gaming and Destiny fans has built to the point where now, days before release, NetEase confirms that over 10 million players have pre-registered for Destiny: Rising.</p>



<p>NetEase has also debuted a new trailer for Destiny: Rising, featuring Gwynn the Reaper, a new character who will be playable in Destiny: Rising when it arrives in a little more than a week's time.</p>

<p>The pre-registration milestone doesn't just mean a moment of celebration for NetEase, as it's also a boon for the millions of players ready to jump into the fight on August 28. NetEase set rewards that players would receive the more people pre-registered, with 10 million being the final goal to be reached to unlock an exotic ornament.</p>



<p>While these pre-registration numbers are good news for NetEase, it can't help but seem like mixed news for Bungie, because it feels like the most significant Destiny release players are excited for is a game that they didn't have very much to do with.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bungie's in hot water trying to figure out how to re-introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">Marathon</a> to players following its plagiarism scandal, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-out-now/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion for Destiny 2 seems to have come and gone without much fanfare.</p>



<p>We'll see if the rest of the year can potentially get a bit better for Bungie. In the meantime, NetEase is prepared to enjoy having two of the biggest games of the year in their portfolio between <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> and Destiny: Rising.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bafta-winning-developer-herobeat-studios-announces-next-title-action-roguelite-rewilders-the-lost-spring.1272975/</guid>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217470/Rewilders_The_Lost_Spring/">Rewilders: The Lost Spring</a> is a new action-roguelite game from the BAFTA-winning developer, Herobeat Studios, the team behind 2022's heart-wrenching indie, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2023-with-five-wins/">Endling - Extinction Is Forever</a>.</p>



<p>Only the studio's second project and its first self-published title, Rewilders: The Lost Spring, will be heading to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch at some point in the future, as a release date or even a release window for the title was not announced. </p>



<p>According to a press release, Rewilders will feature "<em>some themes with Endling on the story and narrative</em>," but the gameplay is significantly different as Herobeat calls Rewilders a "<em>creature collection</em>" game with <em>"metroidvania-like progression</em>" that's also a "<em>Soulslite</em>," on top of the other descriptors already put to the game as an "<em>action roguelite</em>."</p>

<p>Rewilders: The Lost Spring puts you in the shoes of Abi, who is returning to their home planet after surviving a terrible event that poisoned the surface of their home. You'll collect creatures called Hântu, and bring them along on your missions into the various corrupted biomes you'll attempt to heal.</p>



<p>Levelling up, feeding, and bringing different Hântu along with you on each excursion can help shape your strategic approach to each run, while planting and growing different resources back at your sky base helps unlock permanent upgrades, as is the roguelite tradition.</p>



<p>Even though the narrative will share some themes with Herobeat's debut game, it's good and interesting to see the talented team flex its skills with a new gameplay approach. Hopefully, we'll hear more on Rewilders: The Lost Spring, soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-3-enhanced-is-coming-to-playstation-xbox-series-pc-and-for-the-first-time-in-the-series-history-nintendo.1272891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Shenmue 3 Enhanced is a new "<em>upgraded</em>" version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-steam-launch-now-officially-scheduled-for-november-19th/">2019 entry</a> to the series from developer Ys Net that'll arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and for the first time in the series history, Shenmue is coming to a Nintendo platform, but there's no specification if it'll arrive on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, or both.</p>



<p>Unlike the original release published by Deep Silver, this new version of the game will be published by ININ Games, which acquired the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games/">publishing rights to Shenmue 3 last November</a>. Also, if you already own Shenmue 3 on PlayStation 4 or PC, you'll be able to upgrade to this new version, though the details regarding whether it's a paid update or a free one are still to come.</p>



<p>According to a press release, this new version of the game will feature "<em>overhauled visuals, performance boosts, and quality-of-life updates</em>." A few of those upgrades include new 4K textures, support for DLSS and FSR, and faster load times. </p>



<p>There are also a few gameplay-specific improvements, like increased NPC density in Niaowu, a classic camera mode for those who want to play Shenmue 3 as if it was made immediately after the original two titles. Adjustments to Ryo's stamina, health restoration between fights, and a reduction of money barriers have also been added, alongside the ability to skip NPC conversations and cutscenes if you want to get back to the action as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>And, for those who perhaps want the visual improvements but don't want any of the gameplay adjustments, all of these additions are optional, and can be toggled from the menu if you'd rather play without them.</p>



<p>No specific release date has been announced for Shenmue 3 Enhanced Edition, though with Gamescom 2025 set to kick off hours away from the time of this writing, it could be the case that we don't have to wait too long before hearing more about this new enhanced edition. We'll see what the week holds.</p>
