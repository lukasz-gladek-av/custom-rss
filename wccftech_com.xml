			<p>Not even three weeks ago from the time of this writing, <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">announced that it had voted for a wall-to-wall union and joined CWA Canada.</a> Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">covered the announcement</a>, as it was the latest and one of the final bits of news regarding the continued labour movement in the video game industry in 2025. Now, 20 days after Ubisoft Halifax announced its successful union vote, Ubisoft has shut down the studio, with <strong>71 developers set to lose their jobs<em>.</em></strong></p>



<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/">VGC</a>, which obtained an email sent to Ubisoft Halifax staff informing them of the closure, claiming the decision was made as part of Ubisoft's efforts within the last 24 months "<em>to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>."   </p>



<p>Shortly after the news was made public, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-long-0438b7174_ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-activity-7414702213182222336-KkuI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">several members</a> of Ubisoft Halifax <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtney-clarke-ux-research_opentowork-activity-7414701237566300160-nUyA?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">confirmed the news</a> via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgegreer123_ubisoft-halifax-is-being-shut-down-if-anyone-activity-7414680117597245440-duoJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">posts on their personal LinkedIn profiles</a>. The studio had just celebrated its 10-year anniversary after its founding in 2015.</p>



<p>According to the initial report, the decision to close the Halifax studio was not made as a result of the team unionizing, and the choice was made "<em>well before</em>" 60 of the studio's staff joined the CWA Canada in its successful union vote. At the time of this writing, there's been no official statement from Ubisoft on the shuttering, though CWA Canada has made a short statement on social media, with an official statement informed by conversations with the staff at Ubisoft Halifax to follow. </p>



<p>"<em>CWA Canada is shocked and disappointed at this outrageous damaging decision by Ubisoft</em>," CWA Canada <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mbtvhfk5ak2v">writes in their post on Bluesky</a>. "<em>We are speaking with legal counsel, and we will do everything possible to fight this. We will have a full statement after we have consulted with our Ubisoft members.</em>"</p>







<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a statement and will update this article if/when we receive a response. </p>

			<p>After <strong>Bethesda</strong> gave The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion the Unreal Engine 5 remaster treatment with <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered,</strong> according to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, both <strong>Fallout 3</strong> and <strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong> are due for the same treatment "<em>eventually</em>."</p>



<p>This isn't the first time we've had reports pointing to Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 getting some kind of remake/remaster treatment. This is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/">the second time in the span of the last few months</a> that Windows Central has claimed a remaster/remake similar to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is on its way for two of the most beloved Fallout games. </p>



<p>That said, Windows Central is not the only source for these claims. <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-fallout-3-remaster-hundreds-of-people-working-on/">Other outlets have reported</a> that these <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiple-fallout-projects-in-the-works-including-one-everyone-wants/">remasters/remakes are in development</a>, and considering the booming success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a>, and the commercial success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">it was one of the top 12 best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>), it feels like it's just a matter of time before Bethesda proves the rumours and reports to be correct with an official announcement.</p>



<p>"<em>Some have been wondering if a mysterious countdown on the Fallout TV show's Amazon Prime website is hinting at a shadow drop for a new Fallout game or remaster. I'm told that is not the case</em>," Corden writes. "<em>However, we are <strong>eventually</strong> getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein</em> <em>of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, as well as Fallout New Vegas on top</em>."</p>



<p>So while there's no apparent timeline for when these remasters/remakes will be announced and released, all signs point to them happening. Hopefully, we'll have some official announcements soon.</p>
