			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-need-our-studios-to-believe-they">The Game Business</a> also provides data from Ampere Analysis, which includes player numbers for June's more notable releases like MindsEye, FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">Dune: Awakening</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>.</p>
<p>MindsEye's launch has been a very public mess, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">players getting refunds on PlayStation</a> over the major technical issues the game has, and developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">Build a Rocket Boy confirming it has begun the process of laying off potentially 100 employees</a>.</p>
<p>According to Ampere Analysis, MindsEye has just under 250K players, with approximately 150K of those players on PlayStation. On Steam, however, the only platform where MindsEye's player creation platform is available, Ampere reports only 35,000 players.</p>
<p>MindsEye currently has the distinction of being the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst-reviewed game of 2025 so far</a>, and while Build a Rocket Boy has been <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mindseyes-second-hotfix-is-now-live-as-its-developer-races-to-fix-its-disastrous-launch/">pushing out hotfixes as fast as it can</a>, it's currently unclear if there is a true path to redemption for the studio's debut game. Especially if what's supposed to be its main source of growth, its user-generated content platform, is playable only to the smallest portion of its player base.</p>
<p>The Game Business also designates FBC: Firebreak as the other game that's struggling at launch, even though its total player base across platforms is approximately 1.3 million players. A little less than 800K players on Xbox, 541K players on PlayStation, and only 54K players on Steam.</p>
<p>For a multiplayer-focused game, those are admittedly not the kinds of numbers developers want or necessarily need to see, and the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus means many of those players also don't equal direct game sales. That said, this is Remedy's first major foray into multiplayer games, and in its <a href="https://x.com/ControlRemedy/status/1938250909093663145">message acknowledging the 1M+ players milestone</a>, the studio stands firm in its commitment to supporting Firebreak.</p>
<p>"<em>We know there is still a lot of work ahead of us, and we are super motivated about it. We have a lot of exciting things cooking for Firebreak players! More about that soon,</em>" Remedy writes on X.</p>
<p>The other games mentioned in The Game Business' report are classed as successes for their June launches, including Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-suprasses-1-million-units-sold-and-3-million-unique-players/">Rematch</a>, and Aggro Crab and Landfall's indie hit, Peak, which <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1936734056089100646">sold over 1 million copies in its first week</a>.</p>
<p>Ampere Analysis's updated player counts for Dune: Awakening have it at over 1.2 million following <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">Funcom's report</a>, while Peak has now reached more than 2.2 million players, according to Ampere.</p>
<p>Ampere also reports that most of Rematch's player base is, unsurprisingly, on Xbox due to its availability on Xbox Game Pass, with 1.58 million players. On PlayStation, Rematch sits just under 800K players, while the PC version has reached more than 1.1 million players. When Sloclap is able to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support</a>, it'll be interesting to see how the game grows from its strong start without it.</p>

			<p>Legendary RPG designer and writer Chris Avellone is joining Republic Games, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in late 2024 by former Quantic Dream writer Adam Williams. Their project is a dark, mature fantasy RPG, which sounds like the perfect game for Chris Avellone to work on, given that his credits include Fallout 2, Planescape: Torment, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Neverwinter Nights 2, Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wasteland 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyranny</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/torment-tides-numenera-review-tides-shifted-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torment: Tides of Numenera</a>, Prey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Divinity: Original Sin II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-kingmaker-review-carving-your-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wasteland 3</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird West</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alaloth-champions-of-the-four-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms</a>.</p>
<p>The news was <a href="https://x.com/adamwilliam_/status/1938233299442249816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> on X by Adam Williams, who commented:</p>
<p><em>Chris has written, created, and designed for some of the greatest RPGs of all time. Heâ€™s a master of interactive storytelling. On our list of people to work with, he was at the top.</em></p>
<p><em>Chris was at the forefront of the golden age of RPGs. We are creating a dark fantasy story with immersive gameplay and a rich interactive narrative which aims to recapture that magic -- and take it to the next level. Everybody at the studio is very excited â€“ weâ€™re building a dream team.</em></p>
<p>In a statement shared with a press release, Avellone said:</p>
<p><em>When Adam shared his vision and design for his upcoming title, I asked if I could collaborate, and Adam was more than willing to bring me on board as part of the team. I love the design principles heâ€™s outlining for the game, and even better, I love the narrative construction heâ€™s implementing as well. To be a part of it on the ground floor is pretty amazing, and itâ€™s a rare opportunity in the industry.</em></p>
<p>In the press release, it was also confirmed that player choices will heavily influence the story and alter the destiny of the player character and the world. The story will also feature multiple endings.</p>
<p>Chris Avellone was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-accused-of-sexual-harassment-misconduct-several-studios-cut-ties-with-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject</a> of sexual harassment/misconduct allegations in June 2020 by two women. Consequently, Techland, Gato Salvaje, and Paradox Interactive cut ties with him; at the time, he was working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-2-stay-human-apocalypse-divided/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-waylanders-harsh-life-celtic-warrior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Waylanders</a>, and Vampire: The Masquerades - Bloodlines 2 (before Paradox replaced Hardsuit Labs with The Chinese Room).</p>
<p>A year later, Avellone <a href="https://chrisavellone.medium.com/ending-silence-c48e86f7c523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a lengthy response to the allegations on Medium and also filed a libel suit in a California court. The case <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-avellone-case-has-been-resolved-sexual-allegation-claims-have-been-retracted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended</a> two years ago, with the two women retracting their claims and paying Avellone a seven-figure compensation.</p>
