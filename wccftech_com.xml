			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to be among the biggest video game launches of all time, if not the biggest, and its release window, which is still up in the air with a potential 2026 delay, is already influencing the video game industry as a whole.</p>
<p>In a new report posted on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> today, it has been revealed that anticipation surrounding the game is so high that competing video game publishers are waiting as long as they can before committing to Fall 2025 release dates for their games, as they want to see if Grand Theft Auto 6 will indeed release next year or if it will slip into 2025, and want to launch their games as far from it as possible. This is far from surprising, considering how analysts expect it to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, which could have a massive impact on the entire industry, and not just in terms of release timings.</p>
<p>It has been some time since Rockstar Games discussed Grand Theft Auto 6. Back in May, publisher Take-Two confirmed that the game was still on track for a Fall 2025 release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S but has said nothing since. The game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">ambitious nature could make it slip into 2026</a>, but for the time being, the game's release window hasn't been changed.</p>
<p>Those who want to experience Grand Theft Auto 6 at its very best, however, will have to wait longer than everyone else, as a PC release, which is undoubtedly coming at some point, has yet to be officially confirmed. Compromises will likely be made on consoles, and even the PlayStation 5 Pro may not be able to run the game at <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/">60 FPS</a> if the game is targeting 30 FPS on the base model, mostly due to CPU limitations.</p>

			<p>Legion Studios is a relatively new and small studio that contains a team of 12 people who all have a significant amount of experience. The team consists of developers from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-playstation-5-ports-halo-gears/">Halo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-takes-top-spot-in-revenue-in-october-2024-newzoo-reports/">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">Destiny</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/">Doom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-from-the-rift-update-available-today-adding-new-cosmetics-launch-royale-more/">Apex Legends</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/">Battlefield</a>, all of which are announced in the first gameplay trailer that they revealed. They have just announced their new and upcoming game called Covenant, which is a first-person dark fantasy combat game. To get a glimpse at what the game will be looking like, check out the first gameplay trailer below. The trailer is just under three minutes long.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxeAuWTduC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Covenant will have a Metroidvania and Soulslike world, where players will get to explore a vast, interconnected world, where you'll get to go on a long and arduous journey to discover the fighting stances, weaponry, spells, and armor that can help you become powerful in the game. The footage seen in the trailer shows that Covenant will be developed using Unreal Engine 5, with the footage in the video being from a pre-alpha, in-engine build of the game. Despite that, the quality looks great, and the world looks incredibly detailed and reminiscent of FromSoftware games. Even the narration that sets the tone of the video feels very much like a Soulslike. However, it is pretty rare to see a first-person Soulslike, so it'll be interesting to see how Covenant will shape up and whether it'll be closer to a game like Remnant. However, even that title is in the third person. With how quick movements and attacks are in a Soulslike, it seems like being in first-person will provide an additional challenge that may not sit well with those who are fans of the genre.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sort of ETA or release window for Covenant, which is to be expected, considering this is really the first time anyone is hearing about the game. They shared some relatively generic PC specs for the title, which can be found on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. If this game is something you are interested in, you are able to wishlist this game now on Steam.</p>
<p>Much like many Soulslike or Metroidvanias, you will be able to play alone, as well as play with friends in co-op, if that is your preferred method for these types of games. There are also plenty of PvP opportunities, as you will be able to battle in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this reveal?</p>
