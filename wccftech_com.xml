			<p>11 Bit Studios' latest title, The Alters, has been out for nearly a month at the time of this writing, and in that time, the game has surpassed 280,000 copies sold across all platforms, the studio announced. </p>

<p>On the game's<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/502828986443763626?l=english"> Steam page</a>, the studio added, "<em>It's hard to express just how much this means to us. Creating The Alters was a deeply personal journey, and seeing so many of you step into Jan's world, experiencing his choices, reflecting on his struggles, and connecting with his story, has been incredibly moving.</em> <em>Your support, curiosity, and passion make all the difference. Whether you've finished the game or are just beginning, thank you for being part of this adventure.</em>"</p>



<p>The team also ended off on a note that sounds like a tease for more content to come in the future, saying "<em>If you already finished the game, you can be sure that this is only the beginning</em>. <em>Stay tuned and thank you for being with us</em>."</p>



<p>While The Alters launched to critical and consumer praise, a significant portion of the goodwill 11 Bit Studios established with the game vanished when it was uncovered that the team had<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-generative-ai-assets/"> used generative AI tools to fill in certain elements of the game</a>, and seemingly intended to patch them out of the game without saying anything.</p>



<p>Players first noted what appeared to be AI-generated text as part of the background in certain scenes, and then non-English-speaking players noticed that the translations for some of the films the game's protagonist Jan is able to watch on the ship were quite poor and also appeared to be AI-generated. </p>



<p>A few days after players began to notice these aspects, 11 Bit Studios admitted to using generative AI tools as part of its process. In the first instance, where AI-generated text appeared in the background of a scene in the game, it was first put there just as a placeholder, and was never supposed to make it into the final version of the game.</p>



<p>Regarding the film translations, however, 11 Bit Studios made the choice to use AI-generated translations in order to include them in the game for launch. "<em>Due to extreme time constraints,</em>" the studio said in its <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1939707458152448118">statement</a>, "<em>we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game</em>."</p>



<p>Even as the studio couches its use of generative AI by stating how little of the game's text was localized in this way, it still admits, "<em>In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-thunder-to-get-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation-and-omm-ser-support.1238559/</guid>

			<p>Today, Gaijin Games has outlined a series of major technical improvements coming to War Thunder with the Leviathan update. Chief among them is easily the addition of Path Traced Global Illumination, or PTGI, an update to the existing ray tracing implementation <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-adds-raytracing-and-hdr-on-pc-and-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally introduced several years ago</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9596-development-graphics-improvements-in-the-leviathans-update-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly published blog article</a>, the studio explained:</p>



<p><em>It‚Äôs important to keep the game visuals improving. Ray tracing already improves shadows, reflections and ambient occlusion. But now it is time to improve global illumination. There‚Äôs a new option now, which when enabled, replaces ambient occlusion. We call it Path Traced Global Illumination or PTGI. Back in 2018 (time flies), when we introduced Global Illumination (GI) to War Thunder, it was a big visual leap, but technology keeps improving, and now we can do it even better.</em></p>



<p><em>PTGI is simulating light, bouncing around in the scene, and calculates the lighting on surfaces which are indirectly lit. For example, in shadows, indoors or valleys. The old GI does a great job with this very topic, but it has its limitations. It works on a much more simple and inaccurate representation of the world, and it has a limited range.</em></p>



<p><em>The first usually shows as light leaking. This is when light appears where it should not be. PTGI cleans all of these leaks up and makes the lighting in interior areas much more consistent with the rest of the scene. Also, PTGI embraces light more as it can simulate its bounces on a larger scale.</em> <em>Another very notable difference is that as the old GI is working on a simplified scene, many times it thinks the surface should be lit by the sky, when it shouldn‚Äôt. As a result, the indirectly lit areas having a blue tint on them ‚Äî more than there should be.</em></p>

<p>PTGI is surely more costly in terms of performance than the previous implementation, but War Thunder users will also get frame generation support from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel: </p>



<ul>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, working on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series and above GPUs when DLSS is enabled</li>



<li>AMD FSR Frame Generation, working on AMD Radeon RX 5000 Series and above, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 Series and above, and Intel Arc, when FSR is enabled</li>



<li>Intel XeSS Frame Generation, working on Intel Arc GPUs when XeSS is enabled</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond these additions, Gaijin is also working on optimizing the game further, both on the CPU side and the GPU side, especially with ray tracing or path tracing enabled. Additionally, the developer announced that it will add support for Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER), two features currently available to developers via the DirectX Preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-agility-sdk-directx-shader-execution-reordering-opacity-micromaps-support-huge-ray-tracing-improvements-on-nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a month ago</a>. Of course, you'll need hardware that supports OMM and/or SER to actually benefit from these features; NVIDIA graphics cards have supported both since the RTX 40 Series.</p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Showcase</a> that will take place at the beginning of next month, developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/">Alkimia Interactive</a> has published its latest 'Making Of' video going behind the scenes on the development of the Gothic Remake, this time focusing on the studio's approach to the game's art style.</p>



<p>"<em>We also decided very early on, we are not making an HD version of the art style of the original, that's not our goal</em>," says the game director and studio head at Alkimia Interactive, Reinhard Pollice, at the top of the video. Pollice and the studio's art director, Daniel Candil, continue to elaborate on how they were working with opposing forces in developing this remake, as they wanted to make it look grounded and realistic, while also properly displaying the more fantastical and magical elements of Gothic.</p>

<p>The Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019 with a surprise teaser demo being released for players to check out. It wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020, however,</a> that we knew for sure that the remake was in development, and it has been in the works ever since. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/">May 2024</a>, we learned that the remake was meant to be out by March 2025, though all we've received so far this year is a new demo that debuted during the year's first Steam Next Fest event in February 2025. Alkimia Interactive has even taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/">feedback from players who checked out the demo</a> and committed to making several significant changes. </p>



<p>Currently, there's still no proper release date set for the Gothic Remake, though it's entirely possible that we'll finally learn of when it'll be on store shelves during the upcoming THQ Nordic Showcase in August.</p>
