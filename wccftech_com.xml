			<p>With the main <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest</a> showcase event only hours away at the time of this writing, it's no surprise that some of the announcements are beginning to leak out early, like the launch trailer for the Lies Of P DLC expansion, Overture, appearing online, spoiling the surprise that it is going to be shadow-dropped this weekend.</p>
<p>There's some debate as to when the trailer will be shown, whether it's at tonight's Summer Game Fest showcase, or during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">Xbox showcase</a> on Sunday, but based on the images and videos that have leaked on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-lies-of-p-dlc-will-be-shadowdropped-this-week.1209165/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544">X</a>, it's clear that it will be shadow-dropped, whenever the reveal does show up.</p>
<p>Even with this news leaking online, it's not the biggest surprise that Lies of P: Overture would be out this weekend. As recently as last week, it was rumored to arrive for the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and well before that, we knew it would <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/">arrive sometime this summer</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's just a matter of waiting to see where the trailer shows up. The leaked trailer only highlights Xbox platforms at the end, and begins with the Xbox logo, which makes it seem like it'll appear on Sunday. It wouldn't be the first time that the DLC has <a href="https://wccftech.com/idxbox-fanfest-reveals-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-date-lies-of-p-overture-trailer-and-more/">appeared at an Xbox show</a>.</p>
<p>If it does show up during Xbox's showcase, then it is also potentially the second announcement from Xbox's show to have leaked earlier, with rumors circulating that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-revealed-xbox/">Persona 4 Remake</a> will be officially announced on Sunday as well.</p>

			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom may not be among the best-looking open-world games released in the past few years, but it can look stunning with some choice mods on PC, which outshine the recently released Nintendo Switch 2 edition.</p>
<p>A new video shared a few days ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shows the latest main entry in the series running on PC via an emulator at 8K resolution with some mods, such as the Ultra CAM mod by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MaxLastBreath">MaxLastBreath</a> and ReShade ray tracing. As even an RTX 5090 has some trouble running the game at 60 FPS at such a high resolution and with these mods, it would have been unreasonable to expect such a makeover to run on the Nintendo Switch 2, so those who wish to experience the game like never before have no choice but to turn to emulation.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Zelda Tears of the Kingdom - Ultra CAM extreme Settings RAYTRACING RTX5090 gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Mcf-9g5CQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fact that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't feature any transformative visual improvements doesn't mean that the new version of the game doesn't feature enhancements that enhance the experience. Besides offering 60 FPS gameplay at 1080p resolution, the Switch 2 version of the game also features faster load times, which makes fast traveling much more convenient, and support for the Zelda Notes app, which provides a navigation feature, milestone tracking, and more.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom builds on the features introduced by its predecessor to offer a compelling experience no matter the system used to play.
