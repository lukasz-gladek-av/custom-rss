			<p>Xbox Game Pass has been a hot topic since its launch in 2017, sometimes for positive reasons, though increasingly for negative or, at the very least, mixed reasons. Through all its trials and tribulations, though, Microsoft and Xbox put itself on the Game Pass path, and have shown no signs of wanting to pivot. In fact, according to ID@Xbox, in 2025, Microsoft and Xbox are putting more behind Game Pass than ever before.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, head of Xbox's ID@Xbox program, Chris Charla, spoke about how Xbox is investing more in Game Pass in 2025 than it ever has.</p>



<p>"<em>The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service,</em>" Charla said. "<em>As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming.</em>"</p>



<p>All things considered, it's not surprising to see Microsoft continuing to double down on Xbox Game Pass. Despite numerous comments from <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/">multiple</a> former<a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/"> Xbox Studios developers</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">analyst reports</a>, and examples we've seen of just <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-spends-50k-50m-to-get-games-onto-xbox-game-pass/">how much Xbox is putting into every game it brings to the service</a>, the latest financial reports from Microsoft show that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">Xbox revenue is growing</a>. Game Pass brings in $5 billion a year, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>It may have deeper ramifications for the industry and the games on the service, as has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">been pointed out several times</a>, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a time when Microsoft was more concerned with the deeper cultural ramifications of an area of its business than how well that business was performing on its bank sheet.</p>



<p>The future of the Xbox platform has been tied to Xbox Game Pass since 2017, and at least in the near future, it doesn't look like that's going to change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Embark Studios announced the release date of its third-person extraction shooter game ARC Raiders. The game will be available on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 30. To prepare for the full launch, the studio will conduct a final public test titled 'Server Slam' between Friday, October 17, and Sunday, October 19. The featured map will be Dam Battlegrounds; participants in the event will receive an exclusive Backpack cosmetic reward, unlocked at launch with a full game purchase.</p>



<p>Aleksander Grøndal, Executive Producer at Embark Studios, said:</p>



<p><em>We’re excited to welcome Raiders to the Server Slam — this is where we’ll really put ARC Raiders through its paces ahead of full launch. Our goal is simple: make sure that on October 30, when the servers go live, every player experiences the game exactly as we’ve intended — polished, balanced, and ready for action. Thanks for joining us — let's prepare to go topside.</em></p>

<p>ARC Raiders is also available for pre-order now. The Standard Edition is priced $39.99 and comes with the Lucky Duck Bundle pre-order bonus (Backpack: Hatchling, Backpack Charm: Golden Rubber Duck). The Deluxe Edition is priced $59.99 and adds an extra pre-order bonus, the Astro Bundle, which comes with a Legendary Outfit (G-Suit + color variants), a Backpack (Salvager), and a Backpack Attachment (Spaceship Souvenir). It also includes the following exclusive content:</p>



<ul>
<li>Legendary Outfit: Valente Legendary + color variants</li>



<li>Backpack: Pathfinder</li>



<li>Backpack Attachment: Blanket Roll</li>



<li>Face Cosmetic: Lip Scar</li>



<li>Skin: Cowboy Scrappy</li>



<li>Emote: Finger Gun: Rapid Fire</li>



<li>2,400 Raider Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021 as a free-to-play cooperative shooter. It was also meant to be their debut title, but the arena shooter The Finals passed it in that regard. Meanwhile, ARC Raiders was delayed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repurposed into a PvPvE extraction shooter</a>. It'll face stiff competition in a very saturated genre, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our early test</a> suggests it may just have the right cards to succeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ready or Not developer VOID Interactive has fired its long-time Community Manager, nicknamed 'Kaminsky', over their comments on Charlie Kirk's murder.</p>



<p>When asked about adding Charlie Kirk to the official Ready or Not Discord channel's filtered words, Kaminsky replied:</p>



<p><em>I just did Charlie. Funny you mention that because me and my roommate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.</em></p>



<p>Following an outpour of outraged comments at the response, VOID Interactive <a href="https://x.com/VOIDInteractive/status/1969054077737668689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> this message to the community:</p>



<p><em>We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event. These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around Ready or Not.</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first controversy VOID Interactive has faced. In 2021, the studio announced a partnership with Team17 to publish the game, but the deal was called off only a few months later. Speculation ran rampant that it was due to a school shooting level that the developers had teased via Reddit, but VOID Interactive always denied that there was any kind of link.</p>



<p>On June 16, 2022, Ready or Not was suddenly delisted from Steam due to a takedown request for trademark infringement related to a nightclub level. This was likely due to the in-game name of the nightclub, Pryzm, being the same as an actual chain of nightclubs in the United Kingdom. The game returned to Valve's store two days later.</p>



<p>More recently, the first-person tactical shooter game Ready or Not was featured in the news for its successful console launch. In less than eight weeks, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpassed-3-million-units-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> over three million units on consoles. Between PC and consoles, the total amount of copies sold is thirteen million units.</p>
