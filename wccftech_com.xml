			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the most controversial entries in the series to date, and the massive backlash the game received not only threw Ubisoft off, but also had an impact on the game's development.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, during a meeting of video game industry insiders held last week at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft addressed the controversy surrounding the latest entry in the series, starting with a video that recapped how the game evolved into one that everyone loved to hate. At the end, the video revealed Ubisoft's approach to the controversy: it stopped focusing on the haters. This caused the game to be delayed for additional polish, as the publisher focused on appealing to the series fan that would, in turn, defend the game in the culture war that stemmed from its controversial choices.</p>



<p><em>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,"</em> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added after the short video ended. <em>"And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</em></p>



<p>If Ubisoft indeed managed to convincingly demonstrate that Assassin's Creed Shadows is more a game than a message, it's not yet clear at this moment, as no official sales data for the game has been provided by the publisher. It definitely seems to have done well at least in Europe, as it was reported back in August that the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">latest entry in the series was the best-selling new game of 2025 in Europe</a>, beating competition like Monster Hunter Wilds and Mario Kart World.</p>



<p>Although some of the controversies that surrounded the game before launch were justified, and the choice of protagonist and historical inaccuracies can be a turn-off, Assassin's Creed: Shadows is not a bad game at all.

			<p>Throughout its 21 years on the market, World of Warcraft has often been subject to rumors that it would be ported to consoles. A couple of years ago, for the first time, franchise VP Holly Longdale <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-on-consoles-is-still-a-possibility-of-course-we-talk-about-it-were-microsoft-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> they had been talking to Microsoft about the possibility following the former company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>



<p>However, World of Warcraft Game Director Ion Hazzikostas has now denied fan theories that some of the accessibility changes coming with the next expansion, Midnight, are geared toward eventually porting the MMORPG to consoles. Answering a question from Jez Corden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Unshackled Fury podcast</a>, Hazzikostas said:</p>



<p><em>It is not. To be fully transparent, there's no reason for us to hide anything about this. If we were actively working towards bringing World of Warcraft to consoles or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying: 'We're actively working towards it. We know we have a lot of work to do, but it's a place where we want to land.' Our focus remains right now on the PC-based experience. I think a lot of these changes, as a package, are about approachability broadly. World of Warcraft is an incredibly complex game. I know there's members of the community who celebrate that complexity, but I think there's a big difference between having a very high skill ceiling in a game, having a tremendous amount of depth, and just having complexity. I think our goal has always been, Blizzard's goals have always been, with all of our games, to have them be easy to learn and nearly impossible to master. And I think a lot of our changes in World of Warcraft Midnight are aimed at improving the easy to learn side of that spectrum.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, I have played a little of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Midnight Alpha</a>, and the game is still far from being accessible enough to be playable with a gamepad. There are still way too many skills and buttons to press compared to games like Final Fantasy XIV and The Elder Scrolls Online, which were designed from the get-go to be available on consoles. Personally, I believe a truly massive rework would be required to make it truly playable on consoles, and I don't think the studio is entirely sure it would be worth the effort. As such, I doubt it will ever happen.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight doesn't have a release date yet, but a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> it could launch in February 2026. In other Blizzard news, early bird tickets for BlizzCon 2026 <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will go on sale tomorrow</a>. </p>

			<p>Last week, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired between thirty and forty GTA developers </a>across its offices in Canada and the United Kingdom, triggering accusations by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) that the game studio sought to prevent their attempt to unionize. The IWGB claimed that all those developers were working to that end, and vowed to defend their rights through 'every legal claim possible'.</p>



<p>Initially, Rockstar Games only stated that they had been fired due to a rather generic 'gross misconduct'. Now, though, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received a more detailed statement from a company spokesperson</a>. The GTA and Red Dead Redemption developer claims these employees were 'found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum', in violation of Rockstar's policies. As such, the terminations had nothing to do with union busting, according to the spokesperson.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the IWGB isn't much convinced. Its president, Alex Marshall, replied with the following statement:</p>



<p><em>Rockstar is afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.</em></p>



<p>Currently, the IWGB <a href="https://x.com/IWGBunion/status/1986081909278212100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is protesting</a> outside Take-Two House, 30 Cleveland Street, London, in solidarity with the fired workers. </p>



<p>There are indeed multiple public forums dedicated to the Grand Theft Auto series, chiefly GTAForums, which is often a source of leaks. However, it doesn't seem like any significant leak was shared there or elsewhere recently. Still, Rockstar Games has taken a deadly serious approach to security following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alleged-gta-6-videos-schreier-its-likely-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big Grand Theft Auto VI leak</a> that occurred on September 18, 2022. A couple of months later, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-reaffirms-that-gta-6-leak-wont-influence-development-or-anything-of-the-sort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the leak would not affect the development of the game, but Rockstar (and Take-Two) aren't taking any chances now that the finish line is finally in sight.</p>



<p>Originally targeting a Fall 2025 launch window, the most hyped game of all time is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now set to launch on May 26, 2026</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X. Of course, a delay could still happen, as shown by Rockstar's track record. Hopefully that won't be needed, especially as it would further delay the PC version (though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the CEO of Corsair Gaming</a>, PC gamers might not have to wait as long as with previous franchise entries).</p>
