			<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has released the highly anticipated Helldivers 2: Heart of Democracy update on both PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>After fighting for democracy across the galaxy, players have swiftly been recalled back to Super Earth, where they'll have to fight against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-galactic-emergency-announced-new-enemies-and-weapon-customizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invading Illuminate</a>, a faction formed by an aquatic species known as Squ'ith. Super Earth Armed Forces had nearly annihilated them, but in secret, they built a fleet called The Great Host, which is now invading Super Earth.</p>
<p>In a major change of environment from the usual planet, Helldivers will fight among towering skyscrapers and crowded streets while the Illuminate rain down destruction all around. Inside the city biomes, players must tackle operations and work to liberate cities together, having a significant impact on planetary campaigns. They must fight to control areas where the fleet is landing, in what Arrowhead has described as a game of intergalactic tug-of-war, struggling against the incoming forces, with the potential to gain and lose control quickly.</p>
<p>Helldivers will find help in the Super Earth Armed Forces troops, who fight on their own but can be ordered to follow players and provide temporary backup as they navigate toward objectives. The ultimate goal is to activate Super Earth's Planetary Defense Cannons to take down the Illuminate fleet. However, Helldivers must also be aware of the many civilians still roaming the streets, fearing for their lives. Any civilian lives lost from friendly fire will be punished.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 was just updated with a new and powerful primary weapon customization system. Most primary weapons now have levels that can be achieved by completing missions. These levels unlock new attachments that can be obtained through Requisition. Players can also unlock weapon patterns.</p>
<p>The weapon customization system allows tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazine capacity, optimizing weapon performance characteristics with muzzle adjustments, or customizing under-barrel attachments for optimal handling.</p>

			<p>20 million Nintendo Switch 2 units could be shipped by March 2026, and production can also ramp up further if needed, although the capacity of hardware assemblers may not allow for more shipped units than predicted.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/nintendo-turns-to-samsung-to-make-chips-ramp-up-switch-2-output?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzcxMTYxNCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ4MzE2NDE0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JURURUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.otPPN3UUhc4q42s5epuIhmbzdF6WijHgG7OKH4-CY9k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, anonymous sources, who have also confirmed the system's SoC is being produced on Samsung's 8nm process node, revealed the production pace should be fast enough for Nintendo to ship more than 20 million units by March 2026. The Korean company is ready to ramp up production if needed, although much will depend on the capacity of the hardware assemblers like Foxconn. Interestingly enough, but not surprisingly, considering that Samsung has provided OLED panels for one of the original Nintendo Switch hardware revisions, the Korean company is also reportedly pushing for its OLED panels to be used in future hardware revisions.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 now being around two weeks away, more information on the system is being shared. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/">Last week</a>, we learned more about its final system specifications, which mostly align with those that leaked online earlier this year, limitations that developers will have to work around, such as CPU cores and RAM not available for games. Additional details have also come in about <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-supports-live-subtitles-and-text-to-speech/">GameChat</a>, which may be demanding to run, so much so that the system's SDK allows developers to test it without an active session, and VRR support, which won't be available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-not-support-vrr-in-docked-mode-nintendo-finally-confirms/">docked mode.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

All eight skins can be purchased with the Street Fighter 6 Ultra Bundle, but those who wish to get only some of the eight skins can either purchase the Mega Bundle 1, which includes Legendary Juno as Chun-Li, Hanzo as Ryu, Zenyatta as Dhalsim and Epic Sigma as M.Bison, or Mega Bundle 2, which includes Legendary Kiriko as Juri and Widowmaker as Cammy in their fiercest forms, with Winston as Blanka and Soldier: 76 as Guile.

			<p>Nearly a year after <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's announcement</a>, Ubisoft Mainz has released the first gameplay showcase for Anno 117: Pax Romana. The video is accompanied by a narrating voice that describes the player's journey throughout the upcoming real-time strategy/city-building game:</p>
<p><em>Latium is where your journey begins, young governor. First, lay down roads to keep your people connected. Organic layouts add charm, while efficient grids boost productivity. Start with dirt roads. They may be humble, but they're the first step on the path to greatness.</em></p>
<p><em>Resources are your lifeblood. Wood from the untouched forests will be essential, but manage your lumber camps wisely to maintain a sustainable supply. And remember, efficient logistics are key.</em><br>
<em>Warehouses will keep goods flowing and production smooth.</em></p>
<p><em>Your residents need more than just work. They need homes. Build neighborhoods that suit your city's vision. Markets drive income and population growth, while taverns keep spirits high.</em><br>
<em>And mind the fire hazards, especially the bakeries. Fires are practically a Roman tradition.</em><br>
<em>Just be mindful of your city's layout. </em></p>
<p><em>Residents will love lavender's sweet scent, but they won't be so fond of the pig farm's stench. Balance charm and profit wisely. An Anno 117: Pax Romana governor must also live among the people. Establish your own villa as a sign of stability and leadership. Meet your people's needs</em><br>
<em>and they'll advance, unlocking new industries and opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>A resilient economy is vital. Stockpile resources and prepare for challenges, as not every island will yield the goods you desire. Trade is key to securing essential items, but keep an eye on rival governors. Not all share your vision of cooperation. Diplomacy may seem wise, but some rivals favor force. Protect your trade routes with armed escorts and fortified ports. And beware of pirates. A well-defended harbor keeps your goods safe from thieving hands.</em></p>
<p><em>As your city in Anno 117: Pax Romana prospers, your people's desires grow. Fine goods, entertainment, and culture become their demands. Libraries and grammaticus schools pave the way for technological advancements. Public service buildings like bathhouses boost health, while theaters keep happiness high. Grand monuments, like the Colosseum, bring prestige and secure the emperor's favor. Never underestimate the power of reputation. After all, it's the key to lasting legacy.</em></p>
<p><em>Faith unites your people and strengthens your leadership. Each island may dedicate itself</em><br>
<em>to a single deity, but shrines for other gods are welcome. Believing in Neptune grants faster ships</em><br>
<em>and bountiful sea production, while believing in Mars empowers your soldiers and bolsters your army's morale. Choose your patron god wisely, as faith will shape your province's destiny.</em></p>
<p><em>Expand through diplomacy or force. The choice is yours. Trade and alliances can build</em><br>
<em>a sprawling network, but conquest secures your rule. Aqueducts fuel growth while fortresses guard your borders. Prepare your military to defend your ambitions. Whether close combat or long-range firepower, your strategy will determine your legacy.</em></p>
<p><em>Your rule may extend to lands beyond the empire, like Albion, where Celts resist Roman influence. It's a wild place. Will you protect Celtic traditions or remain loyal to Roman ambition? Your choices will determine your fate: a prosperous metropolis, or a city in bankruptcy?</em></p>

<p>It's been six years since the previous franchise installment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/anno-1800-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anno 1800</a>. This time, players are going to the earliest historical setting of any Anno game thus far, dating back to the Pax Romana, a time when peace reigned and the economy thrived in the Roman Empire. The developers have claimed that the new game will retain the series' trademark complexity while making things easier for newcomers.</p>
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana will debut later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
