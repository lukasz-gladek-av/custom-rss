			<p><strong>Update 02/05/2025:</strong> According to <a href="https://it.ign.com/chrono-trigger/217954/news/square-enix-potrebbe-essere-al-lavoro-su-un-remake-di-chrono-trigger-si-attende-lufficialita">IGN Italy</a>, Yuji Horii's words about a Chrono Trigger Remake were, "<em>I understand there is also a remake in development</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Quest series creator and Chrono Trigger writer Yuji Horii seems to have accidentally confirmed that a Chrono Trigger Remake is on the way at a panel during Napoli Comicon.</p>
<p>Spotted by<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chrono-trigger-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-yuji-horii/"> Insider-Gaming</a>, users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> who were at the panel heard Horii, through a translator, confirm the existence of a Chrono Trigger Remake. He only realized his mistake after the panel host asked to confirm what he had just said. When his translator put the follow-up question to Horii, he covered his mouth in shock.</p>
<p>The next thing his translator reportedly said was, "<em>You have heard nothing</em>." Earlier this year, on March 11, 2025, Square Enix celebrated the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger</a>, though the celebrations were not limited to a single day. At the time, Square confirmed that the celebrations would include "<em>various projects</em>," and now it seems we know what at least one of those projects is.</p>
<p>Now that Horii's comments are beginning to spread, it'll be interesting to see if Square Enix is quick to respond with an official confirmation, or if they'll stick to the marketing plan they have, and wait to announce the remake when they had originally planned.</p>
<p>The surprise of the remake might be gone, but the excitement fans have for it certainly isn't. Chrono Trigger is regarded as one of the best and most influential games in video game history, and is one of the few games of its time that has yet to get a proper remake. If anything, it's reassuring to know that Square Enix was well aware of the fact that Chrono Trigger is deserving of the same treatment that Dragon Quest III got, if that is the kind of remake they're making, of course.</p>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">The Shadow Syndicate</a> is a new game from indie developer KillaSoft, announced during the Future Game Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam. Playing as a grizzled husky detective, you'll solve the mystery and supernatural conspiracy at the heart of its 1930s Brooklyn setting.</p>
<p>A narrative-driven game, The Shadow Syndicate, will have you paying attention to clues, talking to the other animals in Brooklyn, and breaking a few skulls through third-person shooting, with the help of a good amount of bullet-time action when the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>You'll play as retired soldier turned private detective Sam Marlowe, discovering what turns out to be a city-wide supernatural conspiracy with secret societies, occult powers, and some mysterious darkness that threatens to consume Brooklyn.</p>
<p>But you're not just bringing a gun to a magic fight, as your Sacrifice Ring lets you use a slew of powerful abilities. However, it should come as no surprise that using something called the 'Sacrifice Ring' comes at a cost. Each power will strengthen you, but they all come with a deadly curse that will loom over you with each ability gained.</p>
<p>There were several games shown off during the Future Games Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam, but The Shadow Syndicate was both one of the most interesting games shown and one of the few brand-new announcements. Hopefully, we will hear more about it soon.</p>
<p>The Shadow Syndicate is currently set to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>Today, during the yearly EVE Fanfest event in Reykjavík, developer CCP unveiled EVE Online: Legion, the next expansion for the sci-fi sandbox MMO.</p>
<p>This expansion will empower leaders with new capabilities to recruit, organize, and stand apart through the Freelance Jobs system. Capsuleers can engage with player-run corporations on their own terms and make their mark in New Eden. From day one, they can choose their path by taking on player-created jobs - whether it be transporting vital supplies, diving into battle, or masterminding industrial operations. Each task becomes a step towards finding purpose in a corporation, building a reputation, and participating in the notorious player-driven wars that have defined EVE Online since its debut 22 years ago.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a new expansion without new ships, and CCP is adding two big ones. The Babaroga is a cutting-edge Triglavian Tech II marauder equipped with entropic disintegrators and a bastion module that delivers game-changing sub-capital DPS. The Sarathiel, on the other hand, is a fierce and agile Angel Cartel dreadnought ready to rain down long-range capital-class destruction with massive bonuses to projectile damage and drop. This is the only dreadnought in the game capable of using a Capital Micro Jump Drive in siege mode.</p>
<p>Additionally, CCP revealed that Alliances can now expand their influence in more nuanced ways, such as fortifying systems, exploiting resources, and shaping the future borders of power. Moreover, the new Corporation Palette allows players to unify their visual identity and fly under shared colors.</p>
<p>Legion was developed alongside the player-run Council of Stellar Management. The expansion will also introduce significant balance tweaks to cruisers and capital ships, alongside a revamped map experience. Omega clones now gain even more Skill Points through the AIR Career Program, helping pilots evolve faster than ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legion | Expansion Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1AbLH_uGLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bergur Finnbogason, Creative Director of EVE Online, said:</p>
<p><em>With Legion, we’re opening a direct path to joining the fight in gaming’s largest war: the record-breaking space-spanning conflicts that can only be found in EVE Online. Freelance Jobs give anyone, regardless of experience, the power to fleet up, earn rewards, and shape the future of New Eden.</em></p>
<p>Snorri Árnason, EVE Online's Game Director, added:</p>
<p><em>Step up. Right now is the time to assume your role as a leader and take command of EVE. With Freelance Jobs and fresh blood entering the battlefield, the power to expand your influence and define your legacy has never been greater. Unleash the might of two new formidable warships to break open the frontlines and seize control.</em></p>
<p>Also, during the EVE Fanfest keynote, CCP revealed that the first-person shooter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-vanguard-will-bring-the-mmorpgs-legendary-betrayals-to-a-shooter-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Vanguard</a> will launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1872800/EVE_Vanguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> sometime in Summer 2026. On September 16, a public test event, Nemesis, will be the last chance to try the game before its official debut next year.</p>
<p>Look forward to more event coverage in the next few days from our Kai Tatsumoto, who's boots on the ground on the showfloor.</p>
