			<p>Blizzard will give players a complete and detailed look at Diablo IV's Season 8: Belial's Return this <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-will-detail-diablo-ivs-season-8-belials-return-on-april-24/">Thursday, April 24, 2025</a>. However, a new gameplay trailer for Season 8 shows off some of the new boss attacks and lair bosses players will be able to use.</p>
<p>Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189530/combat-deception-in-season-8-belials-return#Deliver">published</a> a detailed blog post delving deeper into combat in Season 8 and the new gameplay trailer. For example, regarding boss powers, there are 24 bosses players can pull attacks from, with each having a main and a modifier effect. We also got a complete list of the boss attacks players can utilize.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Belial's Return | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUlRtsPBg-w?start=83&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Specific boss attacks can be acquired at any difficulty level, while others are only available at Torment I or higher levels. Regarding difficulty levels, Blizzard now has a new tiered system for what were previously considered endgame bosses, with a reworking of its lair bosses.</p>
<p>There are three tiers to lair bosses now: Initiate, Greater, and Exalted. These bosses are only available to you if you're playing on Torment I or a higher difficulty level, and you'll also need to own the Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p>
<p>Blizzard also detailed a few new legendary and unique items players can grind for in Season 8, with new items for Barbarian, Necromancer, Sorcerer, Druid, Rogue, and Spiritborn players.</p>
<p>Another significant change in Season 8 is the introduction of Reliquaries, which is a new way to earn rewards and a "<em>refresh</em>" of the battle pass system in Diablo IV. You'll need to purchase most Reliquaries using Platinum, while certain milestone events will have Reliquaries attached to them upon completion.</p>
<p>There's still more to come later in the week ahead of the launch of Belial's Return on April 29, 2025.</p>

			<p>The first thing you notice about Compulsion Games' latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, might be its striking visuals, but its strongest aspect is its excellent storytelling.</p>
<p>That includes the writing and performances in the cutscenes and the notes you can discover that add more context to the story. That's why, beyond just doing it for the achievement, it is worth your time to try and find all of the 103 notes there are to find across the 14 chapters of South of Midnight's story.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find the 4 notes hiding in Chapter 8.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 8</h2>
<p>After having to look out for 15 notes in Chapter 7, you'll be happy to know that Chapter 8 is a much easier time with only 4 notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Their Eyes Were Watching -&nbsp;</strong>You'll be able to find this note right at the beginning of the level, immediately after using a wind tunnel for the first time. When you land, it'll be waiting on a tree stump to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346-Weird Happenings -</strong> After using a wind tunnel for the second time in the level, head left when you land to find a Floof knot and this note lying on the ground.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346- Red Yarn</strong> - After finding the previous note, you'll have to clear some branches away to wall-run over a gap. When you reach the other side, on the right side of the path, you'll find some sunflowers with a tree stump next to them, where you'll find this note waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta 346 - Search Called Off</strong> - You'll find this note just after the first combat encounter of the level. Use the grapple hook to cross the gap after completing the encounter, and before heading into the cave blocked by wood and red yarn, this note will be on the ground on the right side of the path.</p>
<p>And that's where to find all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 8. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll have found 57 notes by now. Only 46 more to find.</p>
