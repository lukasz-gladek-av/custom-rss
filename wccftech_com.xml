			<p>Beat Saber developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/facebook-acquires-beat-saber-studio-says-this-is-just-the-beginning/">Beat Games</a> has announced that it will no longer be releasing new Beat Saber content for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions of the game, which are essentially the PSVR and PS VR2 versions.</p>
<p>The game will still be available to purchase, and any already purchased content for those who already own the game and a litany of songs for it will still be able to play everything they've bought, but June 18, 2025, (which is today's date) is the final date for new content for Beat Saber on PS5 and PS4. Lady Gaga's <em>Abracadabra</em> will be the final song to be added to the Beat Saber library on PlayStation.</p>
<p>"<em>As we look to the future and plan the next big leap for Beat Saber, we have made the decision to no longer release updates for PS4 and PS5 starting in June 2025,</em>" Beat Games began in a statement published to the <a href="https://x.com/BeatSaber/status/1935314587240276467">Beat Saber X account</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our passion for VR remains unwavering. We are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and what we can bring to Beat Saber fans who have been on this journey with us over the past 7 years</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We're grateful for the incredible support you've shown us over the years, and we're excited to share what the future holds for Beat Saber.</em>"</p>

<p>While no new content will be available for the game on PS5 and PS4 after today, players on PlayStation will still be able to play multiplayer from now until <strong>January 21, 2026.&nbsp;</strong>After that, multiplayer will no longer be available to PS5 and PS4 players.</p>
<p>For so many VR enthusiasts, Beat Saber has been the must-buy game with each new headset that has been released since the game first launched in 2018. It's arguably the most popular and recognizable VR game ever, and it only came to PlayStation's current generation of VR headset, the PS VR2, two short years ago in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/beat-saber-launches-on-ps-vr2-today-with-new-queen-music-pack/">May 2023</a>.</p>
<p>It's been no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-production-reportedly-paused-until-sony-sells-current-backlog/">things aren't going amazingly well for PlayStation's VR efforts</a>, and it definitely isn't a good sign that what is arguably the most significant VR game to-date is turning away from the PS VR2 so quickly.</p>
