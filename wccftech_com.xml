			<p>Nintendo is famously an extremely litigious company, going to great lengths to <a href="https://wccftech.com/genki-gets-sued-for-its-nintendo-switch-2-replica-says-itll-respond-thoughtfully/">sue anyone</a> who even so much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">breathes</a> on its copyright. It's also usually successful in its legal pursuits, and a settlement in a recent case is its latest success. As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-wins-2-million-settlement-against-switch-modchip-seller-who-previously-denied-wrongdoing/">VGC</a>, Ryan Daly, who ran the online store Modded Hardware, agreed to pay Nintendo $2 million to settle Nintendo's case against Daly, rather than try to take it to court.</p>



<p>The legal battle began in July 2024, with Nintendo filing a complaint against Daly, though their communication began a few months prior in March, when Nintendo contacted Daly, warning him that they would pursue legal action if Daly did not cease the sale of Nintendo Switch mod chips and the "<em>trafficking in circumvention devices</em>." Per the complaint in July, Daly initially agreed to comply with the request, though continued to sell modchips and offer services allowing people to send in their own Switch devices to Daly and get modded Switch consoles back.</p>



<p>Daly argued that he was looking for a new lawyer, and when Nintendo filed its complaint in July, Daly answered with his own defence, and denied "<em>any wrongdoing</em>" on his part. </p>



<p>Now, however, instead of taking the case to court, he's agreed to pay Nintendo $2 million for his lack of wrongdoing, and comply with a "<em>permanent injunction</em>" that prevents Daly from selling modded consoles, handling modded consoles, promoting them, or providing others with information on how to mod console hardware.</p>



<p>Other recent suits from the Mario company include it going after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuzu-switch-emulator-hit-by-nintendo-lawsuit-seeking-damages-and-total-shutdown-of-the-software/">Switch emulator Yuzu</a>, a streamer who <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-sues-gamer-who-streamed-unreleased-and-pirated-titles-while-pocketpair-shares-details-of-palworld-lawsuit/">livestreamed pirated copies of old Nintendo games</a>, and of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">its pursuit against Palworld maker, PocketPair.</a></p>

			<p>This coming November 7, 2025, will mark the first anniversary of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-unboxing/">PS5 Pro's launch</a>, a console that, in a physical sense, marked the halfway point of the PlayStation 5 generation, and the deeper we get into the PS5's life cycle, the closer we get to PlayStation 6. While pretty much everything we've heard about the next generation of PlayStation is rumors and speculation, a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/">Insider-Gaming</a> does make a good deal of sense, that the coming PS6 will launch with a detachable disc drive.</p>



<p>The reality of PlayStation consoles having <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-slim-drive-multiple-consoles/">a detachable disc drive is already here</a>, and has been the case since 2023, so it's not in the least surprising that Sony and PlayStation would look to make the next console generation compatible with its current manufacturing process, which, according to Insider-Gaming's report, is one of the reasons behind the decision. According to its sources, PlayStation will sell the PS6 the same way it currently sells the PS5.</p>



<p>You'll be able to buy a PlayStation 6 with a disc drive pre-attached and bundled in, or buy it without the disc drive, with the option to add it later if you wish, by buying the disc drive on its own.</p>



<p>Besides the manufacturing reasons, it's also been previously pointed out that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-discless/">PlayStation isn't ready to release a digital-only console</a>. That said, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">rumored handheld PlayStation</a> won't have a disc drive, and the fact that the drives are already an option shows how PlayStation is inching towards a digital-only future. At least for now, players who still care about buying physical discs still have that option.</p>
