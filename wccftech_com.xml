			<p>Two days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">Yuri Lowenthal confirmed in a post on BlueSky</a> that he wouldn't be returning to reprise his role as Yosuke in the Persona 4 Remake, a project that had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">rumored</a> to be happening, but not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>Lowenthal's claims that he potentially "<em>begged</em>" to be asked back and the fact that he deleted his original post made it look like Lowenthal had gone rogue, confirming his absence from the game as a small rebellious act against Atlus and SEGA.</p>
<p>But then a second actor, Erin Fitzgerald, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-wont-see-the-return-of-another-beloved-voice-actress/">confirmed her absence from the Persona 4 Remake</a> in a similar manner. Again, posting on BlueSky, Fitzgerald said, "<em>For those asking, I have not been asked to reprise my role as Chie Satonaka in the Persona 4 remake. RIP. I am blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her.</em>"</p>
<p>And now today, for a third day in a row, another Persona 4 voice actor has come out on social media to say that they will not reprise their role in the Persona 4 Remake. This time, it's Amanda Winn Lee, the only difference this time is that <a href="https://x.com/amandawinnlee/status/1928242559685472293">she posted the news on X</a> instead of BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em><span>Since, I've had several people ask me: No, I wasn't asked to voice Yukiko in the P4 remake</span></em>."</p>
<p>The first time, it seemed like Lowenthal had gone rogue. Fitzgerald's post then opened up the possibility that the cast are all voicing their displeasure about not being asked back for the remake. That could still be true, but now that a third actor has come out and made the same claim, for a third day in a row, for a game that's not even officially confirmed, it's starting to feel like a marketing ploy ahead of the game's reveal, most likely next week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest.</a></p>
<p>A user on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oscarexplosion.bsky.social/post/3lqefs2747226">BlueSky</a> also cleverly noticed that the order of these announcements also matches the order the characters each of these actors play are added to your party in Persona 4. If Matt Mercer is next to say that they weren't asked back to voice Kanji Tatsumi, with the same wording, then this has almost certainly all been a marketing ploy to build up awareness of the upcoming remake ahead of its official reveal.</p>
<p>The twist is probably that it's not called Persona 4 Remake, with the word 'Remake' swapped for something else, similarly to how the remake of Persona 3 was called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and that instead of recasting everyone, the whole voice cast is indeed returning for whatever the remake is actually called.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will receive one more patch that will allow PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users to play the game with mods.</p>
<p>As part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10th anniversary celebrations</a> for the third entry in the series, CD Projekt Red confirmed today that the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S versions of the game will get another patch later this year that will introduce cross-platform mod support across all three versions of the game. With this, creating, sharing, and enjoying mods will be easier and more accessible than ever with a shared modding ecosystem.</p>
<p>With the announcement above, CD Projekt Red shared an FAQ on the official <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/es/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt website</a>, providing additional details on how cross-platform mod support will work. A mod.io account connected to a CD Projekt Red account will be needed to access cross-platform mod support, but modders won't be limited to using only mod.io, as mods shared via Nexus Mods and the Steam Workshop will continue to work with the game. Console players, on the other hand, will only be able to access mods via mod.io. In addition, not every mod released for the PC version of the game will be available on consoles, although even those created without using the official REDkit modding tools have the chance of being released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S if they follow Fan Content Guidelines and CD Projekt Red User Agreement.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Cross-platform mod support will be available later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>Unlike base Elden Ring, where the differences between classes are minimal in the long run, the eight Nightfarers available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> are quite different from one another, coming with some unique skills and traits that make them better suited for certain playstyles.</p>
<p>While every Nightfarer is more than viable to defeat the powerful Nightlords awaiting them at the end of each run, one of them has some clear advantages over the others, so much so that a team of three of the same one can make very short work of most Nightlords, even if the random generation of upgrades hasn't worked in the players' favor the previous two days. This Nightfarer is <strong>Ironeye</strong>.</p>
<p>On paper, a ranged fighter like Ironeye doesn't inspire much confidence, but the mechanics that made ranged-exclusive playstyles more limited in the original Elden Ring and every other entry in the Souls series are gone in Elden Ring Nightreign. Bows and crossbows have <strong>infinite ammo</strong>, allowing their wielders to spam long-range attacks as long as they have stamina. And in a game where you are constantly swarmed by a great number of enemies, this is extremely beneficial, as it gives you the chance to better control crowds while staying out of danger.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250528130002_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The above, however, isn't the only reason why Ironeye is so good in Elden Ring Nightreign at launch that he can take on Nightlords even solo and win. His Character Skill and Ultimate Art, <strong>Marking</strong> and <strong>Single Shot</strong>, are among the best in the entire game. The first is a quick lunging slash with plenty of invincibility frames that marks hit enemies, exposing their weak points. Once the weak points have been destroyed, the enemy will be staggered and open to a critical hit. The second is a powerful arrow that hits in a wide radius, knocks the vast majority of enemies down, even some bosses, and can bring back to life downed companions in a single hit, all the while making Ironeye invincible for the entire duration of the attack. Both abilities can be used both offensively and defensively to get out of a sticky situation and deal tons of damage, and the very quick cooldown of Marking allows Ironeye to see it very often.</p>
<p>Ironeye's weapon of choice, the bow, also works great in conjunction with ailments like <strong>poison, frostbite, and scarlet rot</strong>, which are extremely powerful in Elden Ring Nightreign as much as they were in the base Elden Ring at launch. A bow with the <strong>Barrage</strong> skill and the ability to inflict status ailments is invaluable, as you can inflict the affliction much more quickly using the skill. Even when using a weapon with no elemental or affliction property, Barrage works great with the Marking skill and builds that improve critical hits. To increase your chances of being able to use this strategy, pinpoint locations on the map showing the status alterations icon and defeat the bosses there. These locations have a higher chance of weapons with the related affinity being offered as rewards.</p>
<p>At the beginning of your adventure in Limveld, Ironeye may not be an enticing choice over other Nightfarers, but give him a chance, and you will be surprised by how good he is. Parties of multiple Ironeyes can destroy most bosses, while solo, he will allow you to enjoy the game more, as he has an easier time dealing with the gameplay elements that make solo play very challenging to the point of frustration. During the review period, I played solo rather often, and my only successful runs were with Ironeye. Not only did I almost always get the final day to fight the Nightlord, but I also managed to defeat Gladius and Maris without the help of any player, while also getting very close to defeating a few of the other Nightlords. It's still no walk in the park, to be sure, but considering the high challenge level and how much melee characters struggle in a lot of different situations, Ironeye does make Elden Ring Nightreign a little more manageable, no matter the situation.</p>
