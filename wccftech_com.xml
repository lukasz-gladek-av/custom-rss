			<div><p>As new information regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's mass layoffs</a> continues to trickle out online, the first reported project casualty appears to be Rare's next major title, Everwild, which <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyeysnjmk24">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a>, and others are now reporting has been cancelled as part of the cuts. </p><p>Everwild was first publicly announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/">2019</a>, and has reportedly been in the works for the better part of a decade. Just months prior to this reported cancellation, Microsoft's chief executive officer of its gaming division, Phil Spencer, commented on Everwild, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-making-good-progress-confirms-phil-spencer/">saying that it was "<em>making good progress</em>."</a> Now, it seems, we'll never know what that progress looked like, or get to see what Everwild would have become.</p><p>Which is unfortunate, though, that being said, its cancellation comes as less of a shock considering the reports regarding its development journey. It had previously been <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/">described as a "<em>real mess</em>,"</a> due in part to the fact that when Everwild was revealed in 2019, Rare wasn't entirely sure what kind of game it was due to become. </p><p>The visuals featured in its reveal trailer and in media presented following the announcement always captivated players, but the question around what kind of game it was going to be was never entirely answered.</p></div>

</p></figure>



<div><p>Regardless, Rare is one of the industry's most iconic and respected studios for good reason. Whatever Everwild was going to become, players would have expected an incredible game, because that's what Rare is known for making.</p><p>Which only compounds the news of the game's cancellation, because it also means that Rare will lose some of its talented employees. Details around how many are being laid off remain unclear, as Microsoft is seemingly drip-feeding the news of just how many people have been impacted. According to reports, a total of 9,000 people across Microsoft are being laid off today.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update 02/07/2025: </strong>A memo from Microsoft gaming division head Phil Spencer to employees has been published online by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">The Verge</a> and others, as Microsoft is reportedly laying off as many as <strong>9,000 employees</strong> across the entire company. </p><p>In the statement, Spencer says these changes are being made "<em>To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas</em>." He also states that more specifics around these cuts will be dolled out across the next few days, which means we'll continue to see the damage these layoffs have done over the course of the week.</p><p>Spencer also admits that these cuts are coming at a time when the numbers from the Gaming division are actually on the rise, though considering that Tango Gameworks' reward for making an award-winning title in Hi-Fi Rush was being shut down, its practically part of Microsoft's playbook to enact these mass layoffs in good times and bad.</p><p>"<em>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger</em>," Spencer writes. "<em>The success we're seeing currently is based on tough choices we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities.</em>"</p><p>Further in the statement, Spencer acknowledges that Microsoft and Xbox would not be in its current position of strength without the work of the employees who are being impacted today. "<em>Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental - it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams</em>."</p><p>Part of the cuts reportedly include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancellation of Rare's next major title, Everwild</a>, which had reportedly been in development for the better part of a decade before its cancellation.</p><p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p><p>After reports from <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-is-reportedly-planning-another-major-xbox-layoff/">Bloomberg and The Verge</a> last week revealed that Microsoft was setting up for another round of mass layoffs to its gaming division, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA">Bloomberg now reports</a> that the layoffs have begun, with 200 employees already impacted at Stockholm-based King studio, the team behind popular mobile title Candy Crush.</p><p>Those are just the first round of reported cuts, with unknown numbers of employees being told to brace for layoffs at ZeniMax offices across Europe, while American employees are due to find out the details of how many people will be laid off later today, according to Bloomberg. </p><p>These layoffs are the fourth instance of mass layoffs at Microsoft and its Xbox gaming division in the last 18 months, dating back to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">1,900 people Microsoft laid off in January 2024</a>, months after it closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King.</p><p>Shortly after that Xbox shuttered <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/">four ZeniMax studios</a>, including Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, and months after that, another <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-lay-off-hundreds-of-california-workers/">400 developers were laid off from Activision</a> teams based in California.</p><p>If the rumors from last week regarding these cuts are correct, then we should expect the totality of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-layoffs-rumored-to-remove-up-to-2k-employees-studio-closures-a-possibility/">today's cuts to be closer to 2,000 people losing their jobs</a>, and the shuttering of more studios, though it's unclear which team will be cut at the time of this writing. A cut that big would be 10% of the total employee head count in Microsoft's gaming division, which reportedly has 20,000 employees. </p><p>The cuts to the King studio in Stockholm were approximately 10% of the studio, so it might be a sweeping 10% cut across the board. </p><p>We'll continue to update this story as more details around the cuts are revealed.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/age-verification-and-more-changes-are-coming-to-nexus-mods-for-uk-and-eu-users-as-new-owners-work-to-keep-%E2%80%9Cillegal-content%E2%80%9D-off-the-site.1233891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<div><p>Nexus Mods has announced that there will be significant changes coming to the website for users in the UK and EU, as its new ownership is working to comply with new EU and UK laws on child safety and the harboring of "<em>illegal content</em>" online.</p><p>Two weeks prior to this writing and the announcement of these changes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer/">Nexus Mods changed ownership</a>, with its founder selling the website after 24 years. This is the first major change and action the new owners are taking with the website, though these changes are less about the new owners deciding to shuffle things around, and more about complying with the<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/"> UK's Online Safety Act</a> and the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en">EU's Digital Services Act</a>.</p><p>The biggest change for UK and EU users is that Nexus Mods will implement some form of age verification in the near future, to try and prevent children from accessing mature and adult content. Adult content isn't being removed from the website, as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319">Nexus Mods says in its blog post announcing the changes</a>, "<em>Adult content is a core part of what makes Nexus Mods what it is; we don't consider removing it a viable option. We are aware that some users may find the changes irritating; however, we are obligated to do this to ensure we can continue to host adult content legally.</em>"</p><p>Some of these changes involve Nexus Mods updating its terms of service to include "<em>more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content under UK law and how we protect children from harm whilst on the site.</em>" Nexus Mods clarifies that the content it is discussing here, including content depicting child sexual abuse was already not allowed on the website. It is just making the language in its terms of service even more clear than it previously was. </p><p>Nexus Mods will also be adding automatic detection for any mods and content that include child sexual abuse. Creators found including that kind of content in their mods will have it removed from the website, be banned from Nexus Mods, and be reported to the UK's National Crime Agency.</p><p>The other major changes include an overhaul of how adult and mature content is categorized, with 10 new content tags being introduced that users in the UK and EU will be allowed to access after they have verified their age. Users will also be able to select which tags they see on the website and which they want to hide. These new tags also do not change users ability to vote on content tags for mods, nor does it change a mod author's ability to tag their own mods. The new tags are: </p></div>



<ul>
<li>Body stigma</li>



<li>Depression</li>



<li>Eating disorders</li>



<li>Extreme violence</li>



<li>Harmful substances</li>



<li>Pornographic</li>



<li>Self-harm</li>



<li>Sexualized</li>



<li>Suicide</li>



<li>Swearing or Profanity</li>
</ul>



<div><p>The response to these changes has been mixed, to say the least. While no one is arguing that children shouldn't be protected from adult and mature content online or that child sexual abuse material should be hosted on the website, the sticking point around it all is how the age verification will work. All Nexus Mods is saying for now is that "<em>the specifics of this [age verification] are being carefully considered as we want to get this right so that the option to view adult content remains available to adults, whilst fulfilling our legal obligation to ensure children are safe on our website</em>."</p><p>Nexus Mods could add age verification that's no deeper than clicking a box to verify a user is 18 years or older, which anyone who has been on the internet for more than five minutes will tell you that children on the website will just lie through. If the age verification is deeper than that, it could involve users being required to upload a form of ID. How that information will be protected and stored is what has users concerned. Either way, a new form of age verification is coming, one way or another, and its unfortunate for the new owners that this is their first major issue to deal with. </p><p>Founder and former owner of Nexus Mods, Dark0ne, piped into the comment section to make it clear that if he were still running the website, this would be his mess to deal with, and that he would've had to deal with it this year. He said that he's "<em>relieved" </em>it's not him at the helm of this, and adds that he would have made the changes the new owners are making now. </p><p>"<em>You can be worried or angry with the direction the internet is taking and the amount of control governments are enforcing on it around the world</em>," Dark0ne writes,  "<em>but the law is the law, and Nexus Mods will, and must, follow the law.</em>"</p></div>
