			<p>The long-rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake is supposedly in co-development with a Virtuos game development studio, according to new rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, Rebs Gaming, a source who has been consistently reliable with past Halo series rumors, revealed that <a href="https://abstraction.games/">Abstraction</a>, a Virtuos game development studio, is the team that's working on the remake together with Halo Studios.<a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/02/rumor-halo-ce-remake-co-devleoped-by-a-virtuous-studio/"> XboxEra</a> later corroborated the news, adding that the series' developer is the lead development studio of the project, so this isn't an external project.</p>



<p>In addition, Rebs Gaming also reiterated that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-ue5-blam-engine-gameplay-tweaks/">Halo Combat Evolved remake will use both Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay</a>, highlighting again how the remake will combine a faithful gameplay recreation with some gameplay additions and modern visuals.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Rebs Gaming proved to be extremely reliable in the past, we have to take everything they have revealed about the Halo Combat Evolved remake with a massive grain of salt. However, considering Virtuos proved to be specializing in this hybrid-engine development this year with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, it wouldn't be surprising for the developer to be attached to this project as well.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it won't take long to learn if the Halo Combat Evolved remake will be part of the series' future. Halo Studios will talk about what's next for their franchise during the<a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-sept"> Halo World Championship later this month</a>, on October 24.</p>

			<p>Gearbox Software has <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1973781293344403545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a new Borderlands 4 patch</a> that introduces auto-clearing of 'stale shaders' upon a version update for the game. According to the developers, this should fix the performance degradation issue some PC players have been experiencing over time. Beyond that, this is largely a balance-focused update that buffs several Vault Hunters, chiefly Amon:</p>



<p><em>For today's update, we wanted to focus on creating greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills. Amon in particular gets a host of adjustments to bring him closer in line with the general power level of the other Vault Hunters. Vex's summons and Rafa's melee power see adjustment to make those builds more viable in the late endgame. Finally, Harlowe has a couple tweaks to make sure Stasis is getting value for players.</em></p>



<p><em>Looking to the future, we're investigating stats and behaviors on Class Mods, Rep Kits, Shields, and Firmware to make sure they are providing avenues to greater build diversity. We are also planning to fix a number of unintended interactions. These exploits prevent us from creating meaningful build diversity as they trivialize content that is otherwise meant to challenge players.</em></p>



<p>The patch also makes a few changes to the Weekly Activities in Borderlands 4. The Big Encore Boss is now a tougher variant of a different existing boss, and it'll come with an even better loot pool. This week, the boss you want to tackle for this activity is Driller Hole.</p>



<p>The Weekly Wildcard Missions have also been buffed, providing a guaranteed Legendary drop that can be repeatedly earned to obtain the 'ideal roll'. This week, the Wildcard Mission is Means of Ascent (Deflector, Tricky, Cold Hearted), and its reward is the Star Helix - Legendary Daedalus Assault Rifle. Finally, the studio shared a picture hint to the whereabouts of Mauriceâ€™s Black Market Vending Machine.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 was supposed to launch today on Nintendo Switch 2, but Gearbox suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed this version indefinitely (canceling existing pre-orders, too) on September 23</a>. Earlier this week, the studio also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-debuts-first-new-vault-hunter-borderlands-4-paid-story-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a glimpse at the first post-launch Vault Hunter, C4SH</a>, a former casino bot whose abilities will all revolve around the element of luck.</p>
