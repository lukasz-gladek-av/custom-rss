			<p>It's been announced today by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/04/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-launches-february-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Baskin</a>, Social Media and Community Manager of Arrowhead Game Studios, that the next Warbond to be added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wins-goty-at-tiga-awards-2024/">award-winning</a> Helldivers 2 will be released on February 6. Its full title is Warbond: Servants of Freedom. Helldivers 2 is already an incredibly chaotic game, but now even more chaos will be unleashed with the addition of Portable Hellbombs, which you can carry around as a backpack before dropping it off and setting it to blow. You only have ten seconds to clear out, so make it quick.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from this update, make sure to check out the trailer below, which is just under a minute long.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Servants of Freedom Warbond | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7s2Es5g7fwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Sickle can now do even more, as the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle burns both the wielder and the ones on the receiving end of the weapon. It's a bit of a niche choice when it comes to weaponry, but it may just be something that you find plenty of enjoyment in. Alongside the Portable Hellbombs and the Sickle, you can now equip a grenade pistol. Known simply as the Ultimatum, you can launch grenades like never before. Instead of shooting them further away, the Ultimatum is designed for close-range use. However, it still packs an almighty punch, so be careful where you aim it.</p>
<p>A new throwable has been added in this Helldivers 2 Warbond. Named the G-50 Seeker, it's a small drone that follows after you and then explodes near enemies when detected. It can also be used to target pinged enemies and hunt them down to then detonate when found.</p>
<p>Weapons aren't the only thing being added in the Helldivers 2: Servants of Freedom Warbond, as there is new armor for you to try out. The IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous medium armors come equipped with the Integrated Explosives passive.</p>
<p>To be able to access this Servants of Freedom Warbond when it releases, you will, of course, need to own Helldivers 2. It also requires a paid purchase of Super Credits and game progression to unlock.</p>
<p>Will you be purchasing this Warbond when it releases on February 6? Let us know in the comments what you're excited for with this new update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-can-be-enabled-for-the-first-berserker-khazan-demo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the launch of NVIDIA DLSS 4, NVIDIA confirmed today that PC gamers can use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA app DLSS Override functionality</a> to enable the new transformer AI model and even Multi Frame Generation in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-demo-out-now-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo of The First Berserker: Khazan</a>. Of course, Multi Frame Generation is only available to owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5090</a> or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-suprim-soc-16-gb-gpu-review-superior-cooling-stunning-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5080</a> (the RTX 5070 and 5070Ti are slated to launch later this month). The First Berserker: Khazan is scheduled to be released on March 27; you can read our take on the action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As part of an NVIDIA DLSS news round-up, NVIDIA said that the Unreal Engine 5 powered <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> remaster supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, though the DLSS Override functionality isn't enabled for either the new transformer AI model or Multi Frame Generation. The same goes for Level Zero: Extraction, the multiplayer extraction horror shooter developed by Doghowl Games and published by tinyBuild, which has recently launched out of early access with standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation integration.&nbsp;In two days, developer Aesir Interactive and publisher NACON will release Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator, which is described as the first paramedic simulation game. This title also supports standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth supports standard DLSS Super Resolution (you can turn it into DLAA by simply setting both maximum and minimum Dynamic Resolution Scaling values to 100%). For some graphics enhancement mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our previous coverage</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Warhorse's excellent (as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our perfect score review</a>) Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launches today with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. Through the NVIDIA app, users can activate the DLSS Override to force the transformer AI model to take over for improved image quality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Beyond the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/">laid-off</a> employees, a number of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> developers at BioWare are now said to be allocated "permanently" to other projects by EA, a shocking move for the employees involved.</p>
<p>The report comes from Jason Schreier (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">via Bloomberg</a>), who says that BioWare initially claimed that the employees were meant for a temporary transfer, but later on, EA decided to make this permanent without informing the individuals involved.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>But this week, the group was informed that the loans had morphed into permanent relocations, according to people familiar with what happened. They were no longer BioWare employees who were temporarily on assignment elsewhere; now, they worked for whichever EA subsidiary had borrowed them.&nbsp; </em><em>If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply.</em></p>
<p><em>- Bloomberg</em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">This is a pretty interesting development, considering that BioWare already suffered a round of layoffs last year. According to Bloomberg, BioWare now has less than 100 employees, which is certainly a lot less than you'd expect from a triple-A studio. In a statement from EA to IGN, the publisher provided a vague response:</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>The studio's priority was Dragon Age. During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next Mass Effect. Now that The Veilguard has shipped, the studio's full focus is Mass Effect. While we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development</em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>- EA via <a href="https://pk.ign.com/dragon-age-4/235195/news/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">IGN</a></em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">BioWare fans are no doubt very disappointed by the news. It will be interesting to see how such decisions impact ongoing projects like the next Mass Effect title, which can potentially decide the studio's future in general. The once-beloved developer likely cannot afford another commercial disappointment.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-ray-traced-global-illumination/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-introduces-ray-traced-global-illumination-and-significantly-improves-lighting-but-at-a-price.1099542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-ray-traced-global-illumination/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod now available for download introduces ray-traced global illumination and significantly improves lighting, but with a barrier of entry.</p>
<p>The FF7 Rebirth RTGI Remake-Grading ReShade preset, now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/222?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, addresses what is possibly one of the game's most glaring issues, the lighting, which makes the image look washed out and is a considerable step down from Final Fantasy VII Remake's lighting. The aim of the preset created by ShinObi12 is to bring the contrast and tone closer to that of Remake, which was used as a reference, and tame the adaption to feel more natural while adding RT bounce lighting. Judging from the comparison screenshot, the preset definitely achieves what it sets out to do, giving the game a more natural look in both indoor and outdoor locations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this ReShade preset is not exactly available for free, as it requires Pascal Gilcher's iMMERSE Pro shader, which can be downloaded by subscribing to the developer's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> Ray Tracers tier. On the other hand, the cost of the subscription is only $5, which is definitely worth the visual improvements the shader can bring to a lot of games both old and new.</p>
<p>Despite some issues besides the downgraded lighting system over Remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is doing great on PC, as the game was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-had-great-steam-launch-best-selling-game-of-the-week-ending-jan-25/">best-selling game on Steam for the week ending January 25th</a>. The game's success is totally deserved, as it is an excellent continuation of the series, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>
