			<p>Raiders of Blackveil, a new co-op roguelite from Wombo Games, a studio founded by IO Interactive co-founder Janos Flösser, has launched into early access on PC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-co-founder-opens-new-studio-wombo-games-new-rogue-lite-raiders-of-blackveil-to-be-debut-project/">After announcing the studio</a> and Raiders of Blackveil back in April 2025, followed by the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/co-op-roguelite-raiders-of-blackveil-former-io-interactive-devs-early-access-release-date/">early access release date last month</a>, this new Copenhagen-based team has hit the ground running and already has its debut project in players' hands.</p>



<p>Wombo Games is composed of former IO Interactive and Square Enix developers who've worked on titles like Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Just Cause, and, of course, Hitman. It's clearly a very different kind of game compared to all of those titles, but it's always an exciting prospect to see seasoned developers go outside their comfort zone.</p>



<p>Raiders of Blackveil is a MOBA-inspired action RPG where you'll select your preferred champion and try to craft the best build possible across eight different classes, over 300 perks, and all of the best loot you can find. </p>

<p>"<em>Our journey to Early Access has been about one thing: refining the core experience and making sure the gameplay feels as it should,</em>" said Benjamin Flösser, executive producer at Wombo Games, in a press release. "<em>Now that this foundation is solid, we're excited to open Raiders of Blackveil to players once again. Early access is where Raiders of Blackveil truly starts to grow and we're looking forward to expanding Raiders of Blackveil in meaningful ways alongside players who have already shaped it so much</em>."</p>



<p>Wombo Games did not specify how long Blackveil is expected to remain in early access, but it did state that the game's 1.0 release will be out sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>ARC Raiders developer Embark Studios has just <a href="https://arcraiders.com/it/news/whats-coming-in-the-december-update">put out the game's first winter update</a> with Cold Snap, an update that freezes over the Rust Belt and adds a new survival layer you need to be concerned about every time you step out into a new run. The new update also adds a new Raider Deck coming later this month, and a new event for players to dig into.</p>



<p>Winter in the Rust Belt means that now, beyond having to worry about other players and killer robots, you have to worry about other players, killer robots, and potentially freezing to death. You'll have to keep warm and move fast to ensure that you don't wind up out in the Belt, unable to see because of the cold, your feet freezing, and frostbite starting to set in.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's also a new event with this update, the Flickering Flames event. It's a particularly special time of year where Sperenzans are huddling together for warmth and being thankful for what little they do have, like a warm candle and some fresh berries. </p>



<p>While out on runs, you'll be tasked with gathering Candleberries for festive centrepieces and finding anything that can help make your underground shelter a little brighter and warmer. Plus, collecting as many candleberries and sources of light and warmth as you can will help you earn new cosmetics, weapons, raider tokens, new items, and more when you return with your bounty of berries.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">According to what we know of the roadmap</a> for ARC Raiders, this is the final big update of the year for ARC Raiders, and all in all, it seems like a more than fruitful update to cap off 2025 with. ARC Raiders may have only walked away from The Game Awards with one win for Best Multiplayer game, but it arguably won the back-half of the year overall, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">as it skyrocketed in sales and concurrent player counts</a> since it launched at the end of October.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is undeniably one of the biggest games of 2025. It was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most-searched video game according to Google's wrap-up of the year</a>, and it didn't even release until 2025's final months. Amidst the <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">controversy that has surrounded it</a>, it's simply impressive to see what Embark Studios has accomplished with its latest title.</p>



<p>Now, though, the big question is whether Embark can sustain this level of success, and even grow from it, going into 2026. ARC Raiders wouldn't be the first, nor the last, multiplayer game to make a big splash in its launch window and fail to find its legs a little further down the line. We'll see how it looks a year from now, but for now, you can cozy up with its new update.

            <title><![CDATA[Divinity Is a Turn-Based RPG, Will Be ‘Way Better’ Than Baldur’s Gate 3, Says Larian’s Swen Vincke]]></title>

			<p>Larian Studios went big with the reveal of Divinity at The Game Awards 2025. With the help of host Geoff Keighley, they teased the news with a real-life statue placed in the Mojave Desert. A European trademark <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the initially mysterious teaser was related to a new Divinity game, and then the trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped at the event</a>.</p>



<p>However, the developer remained silent on what it would be. They only mentioned that it wouldn't require playing Original Sin 2, which spurred speculation that Larian was making an action RPG this time around.</p>



<p>That's now been officially dispelled by Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke. <a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with Bloomberg</a>, Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based roleplaying game, just like the studio's last three games including their most famous one, Baldur's Gate 3, which reportedly surpassed 20 million units sold to date. The head of the studio also reckons that it will surpass the award-winning game by far:</p>



<p><em>This is going to be us unleashed, I think. It's a turn-based RPG featuring everything you've seen from us in the past, but it's brought to the next level. Baldur's Gate 3 was a good game and I'm proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better. Here, we are making a system that's made for a videogame. It's much easier to understand. [...] The idea is that when you talk to fellow journalists about the game, you'll have completely different stories. We're doing a couple of things that you haven't seen in RPGs before, I think.</em></p>



<p>Despite the incredible ambition, Larian is still hoping to get this game made quicker, with Vincke mentioning that a three or four year cycle is 'much healthier' than six years. That said, as we had suspected, early access is still in the plans for Divinity, but it's not likely to happen in 2026. This means a 2027 early access launch, with a possible 2028-2029 full release, which would align with the typical five to six years of development.</p>



<p>One way the team is trying to accelerate the development progress is by utilizing generative AI tools. Although the game itself won't include any directly AI-generated content, they are using AI to write placeholder text, quickly develop concept art, or make internal PowerPoint presentations. As of now, Larian employs 530 people across its seven offices, located in Asia, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Europe</a>, and North America. Additionally, the developer is creating a new engine that aims to improve streaming performance, hoping to avoid troublesome situations such as the titular city of Baldur's Gate 3 having to be split in two (and still running very poorly).</p>



<p>In other Divinity news, Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-has-launched-ps5-switch-2-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now has native PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2 versions</a>.</p>
