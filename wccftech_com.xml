			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 design registration went live this week, complete with some illustrations that provide another look at the system launching later this year worldwide.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tmdn.org/tmdsview-web/#/dsview/detail/GB702025006431128-0001">design registration</a>, which was spotted by Famiiboards forums member <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1691253">fwd-bwd</a>, features different illustrations showcasing the system from different angles, allowing users to get a good look at how the ports are placed on the top and the bottom of the console, where the microSD card slot is located, how the system looks with the kickstand opened up and more. According to user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1691278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiC</a>, based on the screen size of 7.9", the console dimensions should be around 201 x 115 x 14 mm.</p>

<p>While yesterday's Nintendo Direct wasn't supposed to reveal anything regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, we still learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-system-overhauls-digital-game-system-introducing-lending-of-digital-games-and-more/">Virtual Game Card system</a>, which will overhaul the original console's digital games system, will also be compatible with the upcoming system. The launch of the Nintendo Today app also brought the confirmation that the new button found on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-patent-mouse/">Joy-Con controller</a>&nbsp;is indeed called the C button, although its function still remains a mystery. Thankfully, it won't take long to finally know what this button will do, what the Nintendo Switch 2 is capable of, and which games will be available <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">at launch</a>, as the Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the system will air in five days, on April 2nd.</p>

			<p>Warner Bros. Games have canceled Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition even before its official announcement. The news <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who was also the first to report on its existence <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June 2024</a>. Avalanche Software was developing this version of the best-selling game of 2023 with the help of Rocksteady. A few months ago, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition was scheduled to launch in 2025 with 10–15 hours of new content and a price of $20–30 for owners of the base game.</p>
<p>This more or less lines up with Schreier's new report, which says that it would have restored a cut storyline tied to one of the game's companions. However, Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition was canceled partly because Warner Bros. Games was concerned that the amount of new content would not be enough to justify the price. Ultimately, they must have thought it was simply not worth the effort instead of going for a lower price.</p>
<p>It's a shame, especially since I was really hoping that Avalanche Software and Rocksteady would take the opportunity to fix or at least greatly reduce the awful stuttering that still plagues the game on PC, even with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation enabled <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a GeForce RTX 5090</a>. At least the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-pc-gets-modding-tool-and-built-in-support-on-january-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently updated</a> with official modding support on PC, although I doubt that it will take off in as big a way as it does for Bethesda's games and a few others.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Bloomberg report also clarifies that the Hogwarts Legacy sequel is still in development at Avalanche Software, though there were few doubts about that, given that the original has sold over 34 million units to date. Schreier recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the sequel won't be a live service game, despite prior comments from Warner Bros. Games about wanting to expand the franchise into that area.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-finals-joins-game-pass-season-6-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox announced that Embark Studios' team-based multiplayer shooter THE FINALS is now available on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/26/game-pass-free-to-play-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass Ultimate</a> and PC Game Pass. Just eight days ago, season 6 of THE FINALS began, where there are now even more ways to compete with each other, as well as an updated arsenal to provide more variety in gameplay.</p>
<p>Team Deathmatch has now become a permanent Quickplay mode for Season 6. There are now six arenas that you can play in. By jumping into Quick Play, you can fight off against other players to try and get yourself on the leaderboard and earn progression rewards. Similar to the World Tour, you will now earn points regardless of how the match turns out, allowing you to progress through the season a little bit faster to get rewards. Of course, winning a match does reward you with more points.</p>
<p>With the RISING STARS Battle Pass, there are 106 rewards to collect that are inspired by the Golden Age of sports entertainment. This includes outfits, emotes, and more. For those with the Premium Battle Pass, you'll be able to earn 1575 Multibucks, which will allow you to afford the next season's pass and some extra cosmetics if you like.</p>
<p>There is also a free track available, where you can unlock 26 rewards, including Multibucks and outfits, to show off your flair in the game.</p>
<p>For those who are planning on playing THE FINALS through Game Pass, there will be specific benefits that you will receive for playing through Game Pass. This includes the Stryker Grid Set, sponsored by Ivada, which will give you a full outfit, three weapon skins, a charm, and a 25% boost to Match XP. When you claim your prize, you will also be given 500 Multibucks.</p>
<p>As there is a new season taking place, there are now three new weapons to experiment with, including a brand-new Minigun.</p>
<p>This season also sees three Sponsors, named OSPUZE, ALFA ACTA and ENIGMO, respectively. They all have their own benefits, which is explained on the <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for THE FINALS, where you can make your decision as to who you want to compete for.</p>
<p>As with every season, there are major <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/">quality-of-life changes</a> that have been implemented, including a bunch of improvements and revamps to make THE FINALS a smoother experience overall. This includes an overhaul to The Store and a new coat of paint for the Las Vegas Stadium.</p>
<p>There is much more included in this season of THE FINALS, which can all be found on the game's official website, where the patch notes break down everything you need to know.</p>
