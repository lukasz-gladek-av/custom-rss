			<p>Netflix's <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery</a> to acquire the Streaming &amp; Studios division for $82.7 billion also included the WB Games division, with its studios, assets, and whatnot. However, the biggest VOD streaming media service didn't even mention it in the announcement or in the subsequent investor call.</p>



<p>That was already telling, but yesterday, Netflix executives finally commented on WB Games during the UBS Global Technology Conference. Answering a question, Netflix Co-CEO, President, and Director Gregory K. Peters clarified that the company didn't actually attribute any value to the gaming division during the deal because they're 'relatively minor'. </p>



<p><em>And maybe worth going back again to sort of how we thought about the deal and building our valuation model, while they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things. Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts Legacy is a great example of that, have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering. They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So we believe that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.</em></p>



<p>Now, Peters also said that the addition of WB Games would accelerate the company's existing plans in the gaming space. However, it is clear that Netflix does not really believe WB Games to be a particularly significant asset, despite having recently produced a massive success like Hogwarts Legacy, which sold over 34 million units (as of March 2025) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the best-selling game of 2023</a>, managing to beat even Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and breaking a 14-year streak that either a Call of Duty game or a Rockstar game topped sales charts in the United States.</p>



<p>Granted, WB Games faced some hardships with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flop of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Monolith Productions</a> (Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War), Player First Games (MultiVersus), and San Diego Studio, but there's still a lot of untapped potential there, especially after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring</a> that refocused the company on its four key IPs: DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat. It would perhaps warrant a little more consideration than what Netflix is giving them.</p>



<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery deal is far from closed, anyway, especially after Paramount Skydance <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its hostile bid of $108.4 billion to get the entire company</a>, not just the Streaming &amp; Studios side. Unlike Netflix, Paramount, through Skydance, already owns several triple-A game development studios, such as Skydance Interactive, which has released several high-profile VR games, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/uncharted-amy-hennig-new-studio-skydance-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skydance New Media</a>, Amy Hennig's studio working on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-once-again-now-arriving-mid-late-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently delayed to the latter half of 2026</a>) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-will-get-to-make-a-star-wars-game-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an untitled Star Wars game</a>. Netflix, on the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed down its only triple-A game studio last year</a>.</p>

			<p>The final major update for Battlefield 6 - Season 1 has arrived with Winter Offensive, the third update that we knew little <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">about when we first previewed Season 1 back in October</a>. This update adds a new refresh of the Empire State map, turning New York into a frozen, snow-filled battlefield. It adds a new Ice Pick melee weapon, new limited-time game modes, and a whole host of tweaks and changes to the game.</p>



<p>The new limited-time Ice Lock version of the Empire State map is one of the highlights in the Winter Offensive update, as are the new limited-time multiplayer and gauntlet modes that pull players through variations of the Ice Lock Empire State map and introduce a new Freeze mechanic limited to the event.</p>



<p>There's also, of course, a new battle pass for players to work through, which is where you'll be able to unlock the Ice Pick melee weapon introduced with this update.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding changes to the game, update 1.1.3.0 includes improvements to hit registration "<em>across all situations that previously felt unreliable</em>," according to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-0">a blog post on the official Battlefield website</a>. There's also enhanced close-range soldier visibility by way of stronger character highlights, refined weapon handling to help players be accurate with their shots more consistently, and improved reliability for some of the most-used gadgets in the game.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have also made a point to improve the game's audio across the board, update the layouts for Rush and Breakthrough maps, and strengthen vehicle clarity. </p>



<p>It's a fairly sizable update and a solid way to end off Season 1, since this is the final major piece of what we knew was coming in Season 1. So far, Battlefield 6 has been the shooter-of-the-year in 2025, taking the thunder that would have otherwise been held by Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll see how well EA and Battlefield Studios can carry its momentum into the new year.</p>
