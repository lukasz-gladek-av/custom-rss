			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden leadership change at the helm of <strong>Microsoft Gaming</strong> and <strong>Xbox</strong></a>, with <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> and <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> leaving their roles, has inevitably dominated the gaming industry conversation over the past few days. </p>



<p>While Phil Spencer's retirement was in the air (<a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite Microsoft denying it just a few months ago</a>) after a long tenure, it was believed that Sarah Bond, who had been president of Xbox since October 2023, would be the natural successor. Bond has instead left the company, and a subsequent report by The Verge <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-phil-spencer-no-one-liked-everything-is-an-xbox-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that she was the main driver behind the controversial 'This Is an Xbox' marketing campaign</a></strong>, which fans didn't take well at all.</p>



<p>Microsoft has instead selected <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, previously president of CoreAI, as the new CEO of the gaming division. It was another decision that has so far proven controversial; Xbox founder <strong>Seamus Blackley</strong>, who first thought of a Microsoft console and pitched it to Bill Gates over twenty-five years ago, openly <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-thinks-new-xbox-ceo-will-sunset-division-ai-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared his opinion that Sharma will be Xbox's caretaker toward the eventual division's shutdown</a></strong> in favor of Microsoft's core businesses (chiefly AI-related).</p>



<p>His concerns are perhaps a little extreme, but certainly not entirely unfounded. <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/game-pass-500k-new-players-for-star?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=189048025&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent <strong>Alinea Analytics</strong> newsletter</a>, Head of Market Analysis <strong>Rhys Elliott</strong> mused that making games is more of an art than a business for a tech giant, adding that it's a "hits-driven" business with long development timelines. As such, while he believes that Sharma could perhaps do well as an executive <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-ceo-targeted-supposedly-using-ai-bot-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even without being a gamer</a>, Elliott adds that to really fly,<strong> Xbox should become its own independent entity</strong>: </p>



<p><em>Despite Sharma’s potential, <strong>the most logical long-term move is to spin Xbox off</strong>. It has Activision, Bethesda, and some of the most valuable IP in the business. A standalone Xbox would be free from the burden of matching the ROI of Azure or the ubiquity of Windows. It could return to its roots as a scrappier, game-focused competitor.</em></p>



<p><em>Sharma may well be the person to prepare Xbox for a transition away from Game Pass stagnation and ‘’this is an Xbox!’’, but for the brand to truly reclaim its 25-year legacy, <strong>it needs to stop being a footnote for Satya Nadella and become something of its own</strong>. It’s big enough.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>The best pathway forward, in my eyes, is to set Xbox free</strong>. Not by euthanising it, but by spinning it off. Gaming is in a better place with a strong, independent Xbox.</em></p>



<p>It's hard to imagine right now, but <strong>it could perhaps happen in the future</strong> if Microsoft opts to focus on surer bets than gaming. Of course, right now, it's more of a mental exercise than anything else, but what do you think of the possibility? Vote in the poll below and voice your thoughts in the comments.</p>
