			<p>Pathea Games, the studio known for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/my-time-at-portia-review-dont-make-me-leave/">My Time at Portia</a>, My Time at Sandrock, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/my-time-at-evershine-is-first-confirmed-game-for-nintendo-switch-2/">My Time at Evershine</a> has just shadow-dropped something you'd be more likely to expect from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/knockout-city-dodgeball-is-life/">Velan Studios after its game Knockout City</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-bans-bots/">Psyonix</a> as a spin-off from Rocket League with Superball, a new free-to-play 3v3 arcade hero football game that's out now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Announced during the ID@Xbox and IGN Showcase, Superball is described as a mash between Rocket League, something that's made extremely obvious with its giant ball and arena style, and Overwatch with its hero character elements.</p>



<p>You play as one of 17 characters that each slot into one of three categories: goalkeepers, midfielders, and forwards. Goalkeepers are your slower, bulky characters that can protect their net with shield abilities while also sporting a massive long-distance shot.</p>



<p>Midfielders are your agile two-way players who can help out on offense and defense, and finally forwards are your offensive-focused powerhouses built to score goals and not much else.</p>

<p>"<em>After years of iteration, sleepless nights and many Chongqing hot summers, our team at Pathea is thrilled to finally bring Superball to players</em>," said lead producer Guo Yuheng in a press release. "<em>We're incredibly grateful to our community for their patience and for sticking with us on this journey. What started as a PvP mech combat game evolved into something much bigger and polished, when a football-inspired side mode captured the team's imagination. We can't wait to see everyone jump into the arenas, unleash their favorite heroes, and help shape the future of Superball together with us</em>."</p>



<p>Superball began its life as 'Super Buckyball Tournament,' and has been in the works since 2019 under that name before becoming 'Superball' in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1059110/view/4264427597941058609">July 2024</a>. After multiple delays along the way and player beta and alpha tests in the meantime, it's finally here for players on PC and Xbox Series to dive into. There's no word yet as to whether it'll come to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, but that's likely always a possibility at some point in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside its standard 3v3 mode, players will also be able to check out four extra modes called Slam Dunk, Dodgeball, Icebreaker, and Divine Path. As it's a free-to-play live service game, it's also launching with a Season 1 battle pass, but a bit of a wrinkle in the game's F2P structure is that you'll only get 72 hours from when you sign up with the majority of the game's heroes.</p>



<p>After that, you have to unlock the rest of the characters by grinding for them, after using your single voucher to unlock whichever character you preferred in your 72-hour window to try them all out.</p>



<p>Superball is also available on Xbox Game Pass, though considering it's a free-to-play game, that's a fairly moot point. </p>
