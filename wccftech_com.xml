			<p>The Decima Engine, the game engine developed by Guerrilla Games that powers the Horizon series as well as the original Death Stranding and its upcoming sequel, could be used by other PlayStation Studios titles in the future, according to some recent findings.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/playstation-studios-embrace-decima-engine-guerrilla-expands-dev-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twisted Voxel</a>, Guerrilla Games Senior Producer Astrid Huntjens is listing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridhuntjens/?originalSubdomain=nl">LinkedIn</a> among experiences at the studio, the management of communication and relations with other Sony studios interested in or using the Decima Engine, essentially confirming how Guerrilla has already expanded the support it can provide to other studios.</p>
<p>At the time, it is unknown which other games could be using the Horizon series Decima Engine, but there's a good chance Bend Studio's unannounced next project could be among them. On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-seymour-019b0b93/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn,</a> former Senior Game Designer at Bend Studio Mathew Seymour, who was involved in the development of the unannounced game until their departure from the studio last year, mentioned the Decime Engine among the tools used for the project, strongly suggesting that it will indeed use Guerrilla's game engine.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be the next game using the Horizon series Decima Engine, and although we haven't seen much of the game in action so far, there's no denying that what we have seen looks <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/">extremely impressive</a>. The latest iteration of the engine can also be seen in action in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered,</a> which launched a few months back on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

			<p>The Guillemot family and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are considering starting a new venture using some of the Ubisoft assets, according to a new report.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the two parties are evaluating which assets to include in this new venture and their valuation. If it goes through, this deal would allow Tencent to own a stake in this venture, gain more control of some of Ubisoft's properties, and boost its presence in the video games market outside China considerably. The Guillemot family, on the other hand, would be able to retain control of Ubisoft.</p>
<p>As these deliberations are private, neither Tencent nor Ubisoft have confirmed if the possibility of a new venture is real. A representative for the Chinese company declined to comment on the matter, while a Ubisoft representative only referred to the recent appointment of advisors to review and pursue various options to boost the company's value. As these talks seem to be ongoing, nothing has been decided yet, and it's likely nothing will be decided until some time after the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was recently delayed once again.</p>
<p>Given how much seems to be riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows' success, it was not surprising to learn last week that the game was delayed to<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> March 20th</a>. Being the most ambitious entry in the series to date, Ubisoft co-founder Yves Guillemot said an additional month of development time will allow the involved studios to incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months, fully deliver on the game's potential, and finish the year on a strong note.</p>

			<p>Turkish independent developer Motion Blur immediately caught our attention when they first <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off</a> their upcoming Black State project last Summer. The third-person shooter puts a lot of emphasis on stealth and seems clearly inspired by KONAMI's legendary series Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p>Black State was demonstrated once again at the recent CES 2025 in Las Vegas, where IGN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeHqPHRAWR0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grabbed</a> around three and a half minutes of new footage in 4K resolution, and it looks glorious. The level of photorealism is incredible, especially for an indie studio. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but interestingly, it won't leverage the built-in Lume and Nanite features as nearly all UE5 games do. Motion Blur has instead developed a 'special pipeline after a long R&amp;D process', which they promise will provide outstanding visuals and unbelievable optimization.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black State | CES 2025 4K Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XeHqPHRAWR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black State is already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as one of the games that will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, which will allow for optimal performance on the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>
<p>In the game, the main character is summoned by a secret group of scientists called the Architects for a mysterious mission to save captives and uncover the truth behind a cataclysmic event. Players will be able to seamlessly move between levels without any loading screens. Motion Blur said these real-time transitions lead to different adventures, ensuring players never know which door opens to where, adding an element of thrill and danger.</p>
<p>Players will have a vast array of weapons and tactical gadgets at their disposal to succeed in a series of intense combat scenarios and stealth sequences, including guns (pistols, rifles, shotguns) and unique explosive devices. Just like in Metal Gear Solid, there will be close-quarter combat as well, with over a hundred cinematic kill moves implemented in the game. Players must be very careful, though, as they will face both elite human tactical forces and relentless robot-like killing machines. To top it all, Black State also includes several boss battles featuring unique patterns and mechanics to learn.</p>
<p>Black State doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll be sure to let you know when it does.</p>

			<p>If you were hoping to find more gore when playing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a>, it might be interesting to know that the game was originally going to feature much more of that. The systems were in place, at least, according to former Bethesda Game Studios Character Artist Dennis Mejillones. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel KIWI TALKZ</a>, he explained the motive behind the cut was two-fold: technical and thematic.</p>
<p><em>The level of gore has a lot of implications with the different suits. From a technical perspective, there's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way and it's got to come off and you got to meet caps to the bottom where the flesh is. We had systems for all of that and it turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you have to count for now with all these crazy hoses </em><em>on the helmets and all that kind of stuff that we added. In Starfield, you can change your body size significantly. You</em><em> know, the character creator had evolved quite a bit, so I think that was part of it. The other thing is, like, Fallout is very stylized in that regard. It's meant to be part of the tongue-in-cheek humor. You know that perk, splatter mess, where you can make a mess out of something and it just blow up into goo? It's part of the fun. It's like those old-school animes, like Fist of the North Star; they punch each other, and gushes of blood come out. Nobody can hold that much blood, but you're like, that's cool. It adds to that style.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Starfield was definitely meant to be more low-fi and realistic. We were inspired a lot by things, The Expanse, Star Trek, stuff like that. So I think it just didn't fit thematically, and on top of that, you have the technical overhead cost to get that to work. So, we were kind of like, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>probably better not to include it in this game.</em></p>
<p>In the lengthy interview, Mejillones also shared his profound admiration for Todd Howard, whom he regards as a mentor. As for Starfield gore, if you're looking to add that kind of spice to your playthrough on PC, there's a neat new mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12833?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorefield</a> that was just updated today.</p>
