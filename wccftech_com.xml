			<p>What do Hollow Knight Silksong and Grand Theft Auto VI have in common? Enough popularity to make other studios delay their games to get out of the way, and hopefully not be drowned out by the hype of either. Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">Team Cherry finally announced a release date</a> for Silksong, which will launch on September 4, 2025. Today, developers Aeternum Game Studios and Panik Arcade delayed their games to get the hell out of its way.</p>



<p>Both studios cite Hollow Knight Silksong's release date as a reason for their delay, though in fairness the situations for Aeternum and Panik are not exactly one-to-one. In the case of Panik Arcade and its slot machine roguelike <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">CloverPit</a>, that takes inspiration from Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, is only being delayed by a few weeks, from its initial September 3 release date to September 26.</p>



<p>The studio announced the delay with a <a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, and added in a press release, "<em>We like a gamble, but this one is too risky lol</em>. <em>We want to give ourselves and our fans some time to enjoy Silksong, so we‚Äôre launching a few weeks later and will use the time to polish CloverPit even further</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>üö®GAME DELAY üö®</p><p>due to Silksong (can‚Äôt wait to play) launching just a day after CloverPit, we decided to delay our release</p><p>our new release date is 26th Sept</p><p>we poured our hearts into our little game, so we want to give it the best possible shot. thanks for understanding!! <a href="https://t.co/QwKwBrBuFJ">pic.twitter.com/QwKwBrBuFJ</a></p></div>‚Äî Panik Arcade üïπÔ∏è making CloverPit üçíüé∞ (@PanikArcade) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>At least in CloverPit's case, Panik Arcade is just trying to ensure that it can grab some attention when it launches, especially since it's a very different game compared to Silksong, and isn't trying to stand its ground as a 2D Metroidvania.</p>



<p>Which is the problem that Aeternum Game Studios is dealing with. Its upcoming game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2710920/Aeterna_Lucis/">Aeterna Lucis</a>, is a sequel to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517970/Aeterna_Noctis/">2021's Aeterna Noctis</a> and a 2D Metroidvania.</p>



<p>"<em>Our initial plan was to launch it this September,</em>" Aeternum Game Studios writes in a <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>But after the announcement of Silksong, we are fully aware that our game wouldn't have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team's effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, Aeterna Lucis won't arrive until sometime in 2026. Though Aeternum Game Studios isn't just pinning the blame on Hollow Knight Silksong. It needs more than just a few weeks of delay time because it doesn't have "<em>all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you Aeterna Lucis at the right time. That's why we've made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio doesn't specify which of the next-generation platforms it is struggling to obtain development kits for, but the obvious guess is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, as we've seen several reports about smaller studios having issues getting dev kits from Nintendo, with only the larger studios and publishers getting priority.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Aeternum Game Studios goes on to thank Team Cherry, crediting the studio and Hollow Knight as a key reason for 2D Metroidvania games being as popular as they are in the modern gaming landscape. The studio also acknowledges Team Cherry's work as a key inspiration for Aeterna Noctis and Aeterna Lucis.</p>



<p>At least in the case of Grand Theft Auto VI's release date, studios have more time to plan to get out of Rockstar and Take-Two's path, since you can bet that GTA VI will hog <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/">every bit of the videogame industry's attention</a> when it arrives in May 2026.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-controversial-267-pve-mode-will-at-least-be-given-for-free-to-edge-of-darkness-owners/">Battlestate</a> has announced a release date for the 1.0 version of Escape from Tarkov, which will escape its early access shackles this coming November 15, 2025. </p>



<p>The news was announced with an intense live-action trailer on the studio's official YouTube channel, where the release date first shown on the watch of a downed soldier, and then more prominently displayed on a computer screen as the final shot of the trailer.</p>

<p>Ahead of its launch, players in attendance at any of the following events will be able to check out the 1.0 build for Escape from Tarkov, with the final event in South Korea overlapping with the game's 1.0 launch.</p>

<p>When Escape from Tarkov arrives this coming November, it will have spent a little more than nine years in early access before its 1.0 launch. At the time of this writing, it's not completely clear what changes are coming and what specifically will be included in the 1.0 version, but with the coming build appearing at the above four global events, hopefully, we'll start to hear more about the new version soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Battlestate just recently released a new patch for the game, with <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/351">update 0.16.9.0</a> now live, bringing a slew of balance changes and tweaks. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microids has finally announced a release date for Syberia Remastered, a "<em>fully modernized</em>" version of the classic title that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/syberia-remastered-unveiled-for-q4-2025-launch/">first revealed earlier this year</a>. As expected, it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and it'll be out on November 6, 2025. What wasn't expected was that it's also making the jump to VR, and will launch on <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/syberia/6794327920669318/?srsltid=AfmBOoryYxnvWd-oUHWGBdjHWbRYZHo7vAEtjwAE69Dtc_vGvS0-jbac">Meta Quest 3</a> headsets a week after its PC and console launch, on November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>Alongside the news of the confirmed release date and the coming VR version, Microids debuted a 'Before/After' trailer that shows off the visual improvements fans of the original can enjoy in this new remaster. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fans looking to keep a piece of this remaster for themselves will also be able to pick up a physical version of the game on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though it's unfortunately only being released physically in the UK.</p>



<p>The story of Syberia follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York who sets out to remote parts of the French Alps alongside her companion Oscar to find Hans Voralberg, an inventor obsessed with making a discovery thought to be impossible, to find the last remaining living mammoths on a mythical island, Syberia.</p>



<p>The trailer revealed today focuses on the visual improvements, but fans of the original are likely more interested in seeing what Microids has done regarding the redesigned puzzles, and to see how the quality of life improvements coming in the remaster smooth out the entire Syberia experience.</p>



<p>Now, thankfully, those fans have a date to look forward to that will satisfy their curiosity.</p>
