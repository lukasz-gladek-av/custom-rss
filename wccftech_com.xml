			<p>Over the last year or so, Hello Games has secretly prepared a Nintendo Switch 2 version of No Man's Sky that will be available when <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the console</a> launches tomorrow.</p>
<p>According to the independent British studio, this new version is a massive improvement over the existing Switch version, which, in their own words, pushed that console's hardware to the absolute max of its capabilities. For instance, it was possibly the only game to support AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 on the platform.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the Nintendo Switch 2, No Man's Sky includes its full multiplayer functionality (which the first Switch lacked), including cross-save and cross-play. The density, level of detail, resolution, and frame rate are all significantly higher. Textures are now in higher resolution, and pixel density has been increased in both TV and handheld modes. The UI's resolution has been improved, too, and this version also supports the touchscreen and gyro controls.</p>

<p>But there's also a new No Man's Sky update out today on all platforms. Titled BEACON, it greatly overhauls settlements and even adds the ability for players to become a town's mayor, taking ownership of multiple settlements. They can construct and upgrade buildings, including new types such as jukebox bars where players can choose the music, merchants where they can build custom starships, and ponds where they can relax and fish.</p>
<p>Each inhabitant can be conversed with. They have their own abilities and attributes, too. As mayor, you will be responsible for welcoming new settlers, resolving disputes and making choices to create prosperity. A well-managed settlement can make its owner rich in resources, but it needs to be protected. Travellers can hire a squadron of wingmen to defend towns when they are attacked by roaming pirates.</p>

<p>This is the 38th named update for No Man's Sky. Following the underwhelming launch in 2016, there's no doubt that Hello Games has more than redeemed itself, as evidenced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very positive user reviews.</a></p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 day one update has started rolling out, enabling network features, playing original Switch games on the system, and more.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-20-1-1-update-out-now-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Everything</a>, the new update enables all network features that were previously not available for those lucky enough to get a unit before the official release, such as using original Switch games, Nintendo Switch Online, GameChat, Virtual Game Cards, uploading screenshots and videos, linking with the Nintendo Switch App to view them, and more. With the network features going live, the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop has also gone live.</p>
<p>The wait has been long, but the next-generation Nintendo system is almost here, and soon enough, players from all over the world will be able to experience its launch titles, which include Mario Kart World and plenty of third-party ports. Among these ports, the most impressive will likely be the Cyberpunk 2077 port, which is also among the first Nintendo Switch 2 games to use<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> NVIDIA DLSS</a> to improve image quality and performance. According to CDPR VP of Technology, the upscaler, alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ram-storage-dlss-push-past-playstation-4/">RAM and the system's storage</a>, are the features that allow the console to surpass the PlayStation 4 system, which was made evident by the fact that the developer was able to release the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>, which ended up skipping last-generation consoles due to technical limitations.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 officially launches tomorrow, June 5th, worldwide, with some exceptions, like China and Central America.</p>
