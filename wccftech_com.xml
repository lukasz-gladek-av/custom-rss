			<p>After several months of complete silence, former <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> founder and studio head <strong>Matt Firor</strong> (an industry veteran known mainly for Mythic's Dark Age of Camelot and, of course, The Elder Scrolls Online) confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a> directly led to his resignation from the company. In a post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on LinkedIn</a>, he also revealed he's not involved in any of the new game projects that have been kicked off by former ZeniMax Online Studios who were laid off as part of the abrupt cancellation of Project Blackbird. </p>



<p><em>Right off the top - and to answer the most comment question I get - I am not directly involved in any of the projects that have been spun up by former members of the ZOS team. I am advising some of them informally, but I am not leading them. They are in good hands with their respective leaders and I can't wait to see what they come up with.</em></p>



<p><em>Answering the second-most common question - about what led my leaving ZOS - the most obvious explanation is the correct one. Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation. My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.</em></p>



<p><em>I cannot express deeply enough my respect and thanks for both the Elder Scrolls Online development team and the players that together comprise the most welcoming, best community in online gaming. I have successfully moved from the first group to the second, and now enjoy the game as an anonymous community member, and it is refreshing and fun. Long may both groups prosper!</em></p>



<p>Project Blackbird had been in development for over seven years at that point. In November 2022, Creative Director <strong>Ben Jones</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the project was based on a new intellectual property and that ZeniMax Online had already assigned around 200 developers to it.</p>



<p>Its cancellation came as part of the latest round of <strong>Microsoft</strong>-mandated layoffs, with the company making cuts <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to fund its AI investments</a></strong>. The news became even more disappointing upon learning that the project was actually morphing into a promising game. The Lead Graphics Programmer, <strong>Alex Tardif</strong>, quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed that out in a public statement</a>, and other reports independently confirmed his assessment. <strong>Bloomberg</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> had enjoyed a playtest in March so much that the controller had to be literally pried from his hands. The reporter, <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, watched a video of the vertical slice and was himself impressed.</p>



<p>Later, <strong>TrueAchievements</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that Project Blackbird was an online third-person sci-fi shooter/action game set on Soteria, a tidally locked exoplanet with three distinct environmental zones: a frozen ice side, a scorched sun-facing side, and a habitable middle region called The Twilight Band. Players would have assumed the role of Revenants, operatives working for various alien syndicates operating across the planet. Missions were cooperative, supporting 4 to 6 players per operation, depending on the scale of the mission. Players earned contracts from the various syndicates they pledged loyalty to, building rank and reputation. The whole game had a sci-fi noir vibe, which sounded very intriguing.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we'll never get to play it. Hopefully, we will eventually get to play the new game in development at <strong>Sackbird Studios</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a team founded by some of the Project Blackbird developers after they were laid off</a>.</p>

			<p>Fans of <strong>Western roleplaying games</strong> can start the year a little more hopeful that <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong> will indeed launch in 2026, following the release of the <a href="https://youtu.be/pi53m9XLE00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer's '<strong>Launch Year Special</strong>' video</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>, founder of <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong> and former Game Director of <strong>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</strong> at <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>, joined Global Community Lead <strong>Dominika Burza</strong> to share this message:</p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: It's been one full year since we gathered here and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled The Blood of Dawnwalker to the world</a>, and what a year it was!</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We are really honored and humbled by your amazing reactions to our first intro cinematic trailer, our gameplay videos, and presentations. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Yes, and it's been incredible to meet so many of you in person at the events all over the world, including Gamescom, PAX East and West, TwitchCon, and Poznan Game Arena. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: I want to thank you all, because hearing from you is what motivates us and inspires us.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Also when it comes to the feedback. We're making this game for you, and that's why we always want to show you the game in its current state as we progress through different stages of development, even if it sometimes means showcasing content that doesn't fully represent the final quality we're aiming for. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We can't promise to implement all of your suggestions, but we do appreciate them, and we always check what can be done. We would like to ask for your trust. We want this game to be great as much as you do. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Yes. Looking forward, The Blood of Dawnwalker launches this year. We won't reveal the release date today, but you can expect to start hearing from us more and more. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: We still have so much content to show you. Gameplay features, locations, characters.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Dominika Burza</strong>: Exactly! You haven't even met the entire main cast of characters yet. Or creatures, or music. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong>: So, to begin 2026 on a high note, we are really excited to present you the new The Blood of Dawnwalker main musical theme.</em></p>

<p>Rebel Wolves have already proven they are indeed listening to fan feedback regarding pre-release gameplay footage and features of The Blood of Dawnwalker. As <strong>Creative Director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz</strong> told us <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive Gamescom 2025 interview</a>, the directional combat is still in the game, but because some gamers expressed concerns with it, the developers also introduced the ability to play the game more like a traditional action roleplaying game. That was just one change that came from the community's feedback; others include active abilities being more seamlessly integrated into combat, the radial menu no longer causing time to stop (now it slows down), and the ability to customize the camera's proximity to the main character separately for combat and exploration.</p>



<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easily made our shortlist of the five most promising RPGs scheduled in 2026</a>. The game, powered by Unreal Engine 5, will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
