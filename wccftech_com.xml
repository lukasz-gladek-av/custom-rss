            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost Story Games, the studio founded by BioShock director Ken Levine and currently working on a very BioShock-esque-looking game, Judas, just <a href="https://www.judasthegame.com/news/dev-log-1">published a developer blog for the first time</a> in the game's more than a decade-long conceptual and development production period. The update provides a few details about one of the game's core features, and shows off some impressive key art, but it does not provide any kind of update as to the game's release date.</p>



<p>We got our very first proper look at Judas last <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/">March</a>, and since then, Ghost Story Games has been about as quiet as it was for the last decade. Though in fairness, Judas has been an idea floating in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/">Levine's mind since 2015</a>, and Ghost Story Games was only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-story-games">founded</a> from the rubble of Irrational Games in 2017.</p>



<p>Still, it feels weird and surprising to read "<em>Dev Log #1</em>" at the top of the post for a game that we've been hearing about for years. At least it features a few interesting tidbits about what to expect in Judas, namely around the game's core feature called Villainy.</p>



<p>"<em>Villainy is a central feature of </em><em>Judas</em>. When you play <em>BioShock</em> or <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, the villain is always going to be the villain. Fontaine, Comstock — they’re always going to be the bad guys," the post reads. "<em>In </em><em>Judas</em>, your actions will attract members of the Big 3 to you as friends. But ignore one of them enough, and they become the VILLAIN. From there, they will get access to a new suite of powers to subvert your actions and goals."</p>



<p>The post also digs into how Judas takes a good deal of inspiration from Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor and its Nemesis System. But before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monoliths-shadow-of-mordor-nemesis-system-patent-doesnt-expire-for-another-decade/1100-6529722/">Warner Bros fires up its legal team</a>, the post is quick to point out that what Levine and the Ghost Story Games team have made for Judas is a system that is accomplishing different goals, particularly around how you'll interact with the three core characters referred to as 'The Big Three,' which is Tom, Hope, and Nefertiti.</p>



<p>"<em>In </em><em>Judas</em>, you're going to get to know these characters <em>intimately</em>. We want losing one of them to feel like losing a friend. We want to play with that dynamic, and we want that choice to be super hard. The Big 3 are all going to be competing for your favor and attention. They can bribe you, save you in battle, talk shit about the other characters, and share with you their darkest secrets. But eventually, you've got to decide who you trust and who you don't."</p>



<p>Ghost Story Games also revealed that it has just completed a playtest for its Villainy feature, which was another major milestone in the game's development, before closing the post by making it clear that the studio won't be announcing a release date until it is sure that it will hit said date.</p>



<p>"<em>While we wish we could give you an exact date today, we’re not quite ready to finalize that. As you know, release dates have a way of slipping by, and we’d like to avoid having to change the date after we announce it. But we know </em><em>Judas</em> is not really a game until the players get their hands on it, and that’s a day everyone on the team is working toward."</p>



<p>Earlier this month, it seemed like Ghost Story Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-mafia-the-old-country-is-a-wonderful-premium-title-seems-to-confirm-judas-for-2026/">confirmed</a> that Judas will arrive sometime in 2026. Hopefully, that is the case, and we can finally wrap up this decade-long journey from BioShock Infinite to Judas. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, and oddly enough, it doesn't sound like BioShock 4 will be as lucky, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/">might not be arriving until 2027</a> as its development troubles only seem to keep piling up. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With series developer Team NINJA starting to focus on action RPG games with a distinct Soulslike feel with the first entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-complete-edition/">Nioh</a> series, it felt like the Japanese studio was done with the Ninja Gaiden franchise, one of the series that better defines the team. As the years went by with no news on a new entry in the series, it felt more and more like Ryu Hayabusa's story had come to an end, but in early 2025, it was made clear how the series is not only alive, but also rather well. Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> and the classic 2D action game Ninja Gaiden Ragebound earlier this year, the series will return to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S with Ninja Gaiden 4, a game that has the potential of being not only one of the best entries in the series, but one of the best action games of the generation, combining the best Team NINJA and PlatinumGames have offered with their games to date.</p>



<p>Though very short, barely clocking 30 minutes in length, the Ninja Gaiden 4 Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the game will continue the series tradition of lightning-fast action gameplay, but with a distinct PlatinumGames flavor. Controlling Yakumo in a futuristic rendition of Tokyo which ran extremely well on Xbox Series X, with little to none framerate drops, I was able to try out his parkour and movement abilities, which include a grappling hook for superior mobility across long distances that also has some combat applications, fight a few regular enemies along the way, which were combo'ed to death using different weapons, aerial launchers and devastating finishing moves, and put my skills to the test against a powerful boss. This fight was definitely the highlight of the experience, as it served as an introduction to Yakumo's Bloodraven form, a special technique that allows the Raven clan ninja to enhance his weapons and expand their movesets using blood.</p>

<p>Mastering a complex combat system with the limited time available was a challenge, and it took me many attempts to understand how to use the Bloodraven technique to prevent the powerful boss from unleashing his special attacks and stagger him so that he could be damaged with longer combos, which are performed in typical PlatinumGames fashion by using light and heavy attacks in specific sequences. What I appreciated the most is that, compared to too many character-action games, Ninja Gaiden 4 doesn't toss everything the player learns out of the window in boss fights, but actually allows players to use any intricate combo they use against regular enemies even against certain bosses. It's impossible to know if this will be the case for all of them, but the fact that this was possible against this particular boss definitely bodes well. With the rocking music's intensity ramping up as the boss entered his second phase, with more powerful attacks which were trickier to dodge, and some clearly advanced tech that required more time to be used properly, including the dodge offset mechanic made popular by the Bayonetta series, the game immediately brought to mind Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, one of PlatinumGames' finest action games ever.</p>



<p>Unable to try out Ryu Hayabusa's gameplay, which should be closer in feel to the traditional series' experience, it's impossible to say at this time how Ninja Gaiden 4 will balance the new and old approach and how everything will come up together, but the little taste of the experience I had made more more excited than before about the game, which has the serious chance of topping <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> as my game of the year. Thankfully, the wait won't be too long, as the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 21.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date/">announced</a> that Skate will launch into early access this coming September 16, 2025, on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Today, EA and Full Circle debuted a new development update which delved into what players will be able to experience at launch, and the early access roadmap for Skate, and spoiler alert, there's no defined date yet for its 1.0 launch. </p>



<p>What the roadmap does have is the breakdown of how Skate will be getting its major updates, which will be distinguished by seasons. The first season will arrive sometime in October 2025, with the introduction of Skate's battle pass that's just called the Skate Pass, two seasonal events including a Halloween event, and of course a slew of bug fixes. </p>



<p>Every season Full Circle releases will include "<em>new skateable areas, new challenges, new seasonal events, new brand partners, new cosmetics, new tracks added to the soundtrack, bug fixes, and quality of life updates</em>."</p>

<p>Season 2 will arrive sometime in December, which will introduce co-op gameplay, improvements to the video editor, and new tricks to perform on top of the regular seasonal updates, and Season 3 will add new game modes, leaderboards, more ways to customize your skater, player-created parks, and more tricks for players to master when it arrives in 2026. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding what'll be there at launch in the time between September 16 and the season one release, players will more or less get the chance to get comfortable with Skate again, especially if you've not been part of the closed playtesting period.</p>



<p>The flick-it-style gameplay that made Skate iconic has been rebuilt within EA's Frostbite engine, and there's a Skatepedia players can lean on to help them master every trick in the book, or at least every trick that'll be included in the game at launch.</p>



<p>If you were in the insider playtesting for Skate, then you're already playing the early access version of the game, as EA and Full Circle have already pushed it to playtesters. Everyone else will be able to jump in for free on September 16.</p>
