			<p>In a special developer live stream today, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-still-in-pre-production-bioware-passes-star-wars-the-old-republic-new-dev/">Star Wars: The Old Republic team</a> announced the next major update that will be arriving to the MMORPG, with the update being titled Game Update 7.6 - Galactic Threads. This is set to be a relatively significant update, as a lot of new features and content will be added, as well as character art modernization. The update will begin to roll out in December to players across the globe, with the story missions arriving in Star Wars: The Old Republic in 2025.</p>
<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic was first released in 2011, and since then has evolved a fair amount, with there being plenty of content for Star Wars fans to get stuck into. One of the most important features being added in the Galactic Threads update is the modernization of the character and planet art. This is something that has been in the works for a while, but updating all of the models and planets is very time consuming. While the updates on modernizing the graphics are slow, players will be able to see texture changes to models such as the Human, Chiss, Cyborg, and Miralukan, bringing improved fidelity to the game. To showcase the changes that have been made, the SWTOR team has released a YouTube video that shows off the graphical updates they have been working on.</p>

<p>Of course, there is a ton more coming to the game aside from just this update. This includes new story missions that carry on straight from the Desperate Defiance storyline. Of course, these missions won't be rolled out until 2025, but players will at least be given time to get excited about them.</p>
<p>Additionally, the update will add a new boss fight called The Propagator Core XR-53, a new lair boss that will launch in Story and Veteran difficulties. Alongside this, there will be brand-new Dynamic Encounters, world content dedicated to immersing players in the exploration of the worlds they inhabit. The Dynamic Encounters will vary, depending on where you are and what you are doing. This could include having to take out Hidden Chain forces or herding together Banthas, who escaped. If you want to get stuck in, these encounters will first be arriving on Hoth and Tatooine, offering a bounty of rewards for players to earn.</p>
<p>If you want to know every last detail about what you can expect about the upcoming update to Star Wars: The Old Republic, <a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20241114-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website</a> has all of the info about what you can expect and some of the smaller features being added to the MMORPG.</p>

			<p>Spanish developer HEXWORKS was one of the first developers to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share</a> information on the graphics enhancements they had planned for their game's PS5 Pro version. As you might recall, HEXWORKS was founded in early 2020 specifically to make Lords of the Fallen, and they've got big plans for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a> tentatively slated for 2026. In the meantime, though, they're continuing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> this game with patches and with the introduction of PS5 Pro support.</p>
<p>To delve into greater detail about their experience with Sony's new console, we interviewed Eduard Gonzalez, Principal Engine Programmer at HEXWORKS. Gonzalez lavished praise on the PS5 Pro hardware and revealed that this version actually runs on the highest PC settings available (though, of course, you can run Lords of the Fallen at higher frame rates on PC, provided you've got the significantly more expensive hardware to do it). Still, it's a major accomplishment that not many games achieve, and they did it without even using Sony's much-vaunted AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaling.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - PS5 Pro 4K 60FPS Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtJD57wMtk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 has been known to have spotty performance on PS5 (and Xbox Series S|X). Is the PS5 Pro a significant improvement in that regard?</strong></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5 has empowered developers to increase triangle density in games by an order of magnitude. Achieving smooth framerates with this level of visual detail required several iterations of both the engine and content, but we’ve now reached a point where we can deliver a vastly enhanced experience showcasing the visual power of UE5. With this foundation, the PS5 Pro hardware upgrade marks a significant step forward. It enables further improvements to object visibility, texture density, and overall resolution, all while boosting framerates. The PS5 was solid, but the Pro is truly exceptional hardware.</p>
<p><strong>What is the single feature you were most impressed with after getting your hands on the hardware?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro enhances the PS5 base model in every aspect: a faster GPU, quicker CPU, upgraded raytracing units, additional memory, and custom machine learning hardware. If we had to highlight a single standout feature, it would be the GPU, which belongs to a hardware generation beyond the original.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>While the advancement is somewhat comparable, the PS5 Pro makes a more significant leap, especially with the introduction of custom machine learning hardware. This addition unlocks a whole new realm of possibilities for visual and performance enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of Lords of the Fallen?</strong></p>
<p>The improvement is noticeable, with a 40% increase in the game’s native rendering resolution. This enhancement makes a significant difference, especially on 4K screens, where details are far more visible, truly letting high-end TVs shine. In the PS5 Pro version of Lords of the Fallen, Performance Mode provides rich visual detail at 4K60 (upscaled from 1440p) with a fluid 60 frames per second, as well as sharper distant details and refined textures on characters and environments. For those playing in Quality Mode, this runs at a native 4K30, allowing up to showcase intricate visuals across the dual realms of Axiom and Umbral at a stable 30 FPS.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to established upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>PSSR is an impressive technology, offering quality comparable to DLSS and Unreal Engine 5’s built-in upscaling, with the added benefit of being embedded directly in the console, making it compatible with any engine: PSSR is undeniably a valuable addition. After extensive testing, we found no visual differences compared to our custom version of UE5's upscaling, which is also highly robust. Therefore, we decided to continue using our own upscaling method.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>The game indeed utilizes the highest graphics settings available on PC. As I touched upon earlier, players can select between two graphics modes: Performance Mode and Quality Mode. Performance Mode is optimized for a smooth experience, while Quality Mode focuses on delivering the sharpest visuals. The primary distinction between these modes is the native rendering resolution, which dynamically adjusts to meet target frame rates - 60 FPS for Performance Mode and 30 FPS for Quality Mode. In short, you’ll enjoy top-tier PC graphics on the PS5 Pro, but you’ll need to choose between native 4K at 30 FPS or upscaled 4K at 60 FPS.</p>
<p><strong>The big <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-gives-subtle-dig-at-ps5-pro-price-were-not-growing-the-market-with-1000-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversy</a> about Sony's new console is pricing. Based on the hardware, is it fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>Building a PC with comparable components - GPU, CPU, memory, and SSD - at a similar quality level would be significantly more costly, so it’s great to see Sony is bringing this high-end hardware to a wider audience. Rest assured, our game runs great on the standard PS5, so if the PS5 Pro is out of budget you will still enjoy Lords of the Fallen, but if you do have that extra budget, the PS5 Pro truly elevates the experience!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is capable of delivering impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/">8K resolution gameplay in No Man's Sky</a>, so much so that the game's 8K mode could begin to change minds about the viability of such a high resolution.</p>
<p>The tech experts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro patch of the popular game developed by Hello Games, highlighting how the game's 8K mode delivers extremely sharp visuals, thanks to PSSR, which upscales the game from a base resolution of around 2700p to 8K. The image quality remains impressive even in motion, proving once again how high base resolutions deliver much better upscaling results. Looking at performance, unlike what the in-game menus suggest, framerate is always capped at a properly paced 30 FPS in 8K mode, which makes the game absolutely playable in this mode. In addition, No Man's Sky seems to be the perfect showcase for an 8K resolution mode, as the game's high contrast and highly stylized visuals with long vistas suit such a high resolution incredibly well.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky on PS5 Pro Has 8K Support... And We've Tested It" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBjU3v67s_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro is delivering impressive results in patched games like No Man's Sky, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the system isn't delivering the touted 45% improvement over the base model in unpatched games. This is likely caused by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-falls-short-memory-bandwidth/">memory bandwidth constraints</a> that prevent games from taking full advantage of the system's power without a proper patch. Still, the improvements are there, making the system a worthy one to purchase for those who want to enjoy PS5 games at their possible best. You can learn more about the system in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/"> review.</a></p>
