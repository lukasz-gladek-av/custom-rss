			<p>Remedy's first online cooperative multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/">did not perform as well as the Finnish studio had hoped</a>. However, Remedy has not given up. The studio has a plan to improve the game in key areas, starting with the first major free update, Breakpoint, scheduled to go live on Monday, September 29.</p>



<p>Breakpoint adds a new playable Crisis mission, Outbreak, set in the Research Sector, where a Mold infestation creates unique challenges and enemies, as well as a dangerous new condition. The developer also overhauled the old Job Board with a Crisis Board, offering curated crises to play that are refreshed every half hour. Four to six Crises will be active at any given time, ranging from full runs to shorter Jobs or Corrupted Jobs.</p>



<p>Each Crisis has randomized rewards, objectives, and length. Crises in the first two zones have been tweaked with streamlined requirements and can occasionally feature unique Alternative Objectives for added variety. Additionally, the Quick Reinforce feature lets you jump into active runs to assist other groups.</p>



<p>Following this update, every weapon and piece of equipment in FBC: Firebreak is fully powered the moment you unlock it. New gear is unlocked simply by playing and leveling up, while a smaller set of streamlined currencies now focuses on unlocking cosmetics and Perk upgrades. On the other hand, Remedy introduced a new progression layer with gun mods, of which there will be 27. </p>



<p>Breakpoint also introduces three brand new heavy weapons (Semi-automatic rifle, Scattergun, and Rotary cannon) and three new grenades (Freeze, Healing, and Black Rock). Remedy even increased the enemy variety with five new types: two Mold foes (Mold Walker and Mold Turret) and three new Hiss threats with variants: the Corrupted Ranger, the Corrupted Ranger (Airborne), and the Demolition Expert. The new Hiss threats can be encountered throughout the whole game, while the Mold foes are exclusive to the new Outbreak Crisis.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's also going to be a new tutorial level, orientation videos, and a redesigned early-game flow to make it more accessible to newcomers. Lastly, there's a series of quality-of-life improvements, such as already unlocked Altered Augments and Improvised Devices from level 1. Augments and Devices have been tuned to be usable more often than before and will also have a more substantial impact while playing. Additionally, moving while downed and sliding have been added.</p>



<p>Breakpoint is just the beginning. The next major update, which will include a new game mode and cross-platform voice chat, will be released in late November. A third patch will go live in March 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-admits-mistake-with-new-payday-2-subscription-and-price-increase-of-infamous-collection-dlc-bundle.1309500/</guid>

			<p>Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently introduced an optional Payday 2 subscription</a> that automatically includes access to all the many (over 65) DLCs available for the cooperative heist-based first-person shooter game. Subscription options include a monthly and auto-renewing $4.99 fee or a biannual $19.99 fee (discounted by 31% compared to the monthly one).</p>



<p>If players subscribe and subsequently cancel at a later date, they get to retain any progress made (level, money, and inventory). However, any DLC content in their inventory, such as weapons, characters, heists, or masks, will become unavailable. Access can be regained by renewing your subscription or by purchasing the relevant DLC.</p>



<p>However, alongside the introduction of this new subscription model, Starbreeze also reduced the discount on the popular Infamous Collection bundle, which includes all the Payday 2 DLCs released so far, from 52% to 33%. This led to a community outrage that brought recent user reviews on Steam down to 54% (overall reviews are at a healthy 87%), as fans likened it to a scummy move to get people on board with the new subscription option. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to the website Game Developer</a>, Gustav Nisser (Head of Commercial at Starbreeze) admitted the mistake, adding that the Payday 2 Infamous Collection bundle has had its discount restored to 52%.</p>



<p><em>We dropped the ball on coordinating internally and communicating with our community properly. The negative reaction makes complete sense, and the community has made it clear how the price change and its timing looks from the outside. We agree with the community, we messed up on this one, and we have reverted the price on the bundle effective immediately. In hindsight, we should have realized how it would seem. Since the bundle only charges for the items you don't own, and the bundle discount is cumulative with any other discounts (i.e., discounts on the included items), the actual full price of the bundle can vary significantly.</em></p>



<p>Given <span>Payday 3's commercial failure (<a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-2-sales-2-million/" target="_blank">certified by Embracer</a>, the parent company of game publisher Deep Silver), Starbreeze should exercise</span> a little more care when it comes to its most prized game IP. </p>



<p>The Swedish studio's next project is, however, based on a popular licensed franchise: Dungeons and Dragons. The so-called Project Baxter, an online co-op game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is supposed to launch in 2026</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Splash Damage, a studio that you might not recognize by name but whose work you'd know, as it has worked on Gears 5, Gears Tactics, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, Batman: Arkham Origins, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Brink, and Star Wars: Hunters, to name a few, has officially broken away from its now-former parent company, Tencent.</p>



<p>A report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-breaks-away-from-tencent">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> confirms that the studio had officially broken away from Tencent, but said it would "<em>not be providing further comment at this time</em>."</p>



<p>This departure also comes less than a year after what would have been Splash Damage's next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/">Transformers: Reactive, was cancelled</a>. The project's shutdown also resulted in layoffs at the studio, with Splash Damage writing at the time, "<em>While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.</em>"</p>



<p>With Splash Damage keeping mum on its departure for now, it's unclear if the cancellation of Transformers: Reactive played a part in the studio leaving Tencent, part of that project's shutdown could have also come from Hasbro.</p>



<p>Regardless, hopefully we'll hear more from Splash Damage soon, as they are one of the industry's veteran studios who has been around for over 20 years now. It's much better to hear that they've left a previous parent company and are still going, rather than hearing another veteran studio has been shuttered.</p>
