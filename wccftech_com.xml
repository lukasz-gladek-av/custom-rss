			<p>The FBI has seized and taken down one of the more prominent Nintendo Switch ROM sites, Nsw2u. First reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, the site was seized earlier this week on Thursday, though according to some of the members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchPirates/new/">Switch Piracy Reddit page</a>, the site remained up for a few hours before being entirely taken down. If you try to visit the website now, you'll be met with a splash screen from the FBI notifying that the site has been seized "<em>in accordance with a seizure warrant</em>."</p>



<p>The splash screen also includes a logo from the FIOD Tax Administration, a Dutch agency that was involved in investigating the site and having it taken down. Nintendo has not commented on the takedown, but it's clear that this is a part of the company's more aggressive effort to combat piracy on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 devices. </p>



<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/">ability to brick Switch 2 devices</a> is something that's been widely reported by now, another sign of just how serious Nintendo is about players using their devices in what the company deems to be an "<em>unauthorized</em>" way, even if they are being fought<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-bricking-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-challenged-in-brazil/"> by regional government agencies</a>. After all, it didn't take very much for players to be able to jailbreak Switch devices at launch. All it took to open the door to a jailbroken Switch was a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44106-nintendo-switch-hack">paper clip,</a> before Nintendo had released revised models of the console to nullify the popular method. </p>



<p>That didn't stop players from jailbreaking the device, however, and the battle against piracy is one Nintendo continues to fight. </p>
