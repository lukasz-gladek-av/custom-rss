			<p>On Saturday, <strong>Microsoft</strong> surprised <strong>Xbox</strong> fans with a brief but visually impressive in-engine trailer for <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> that showcased the game's various biomes. The footage demonstrated the excellent level of detail provided by the latest iteration of the <strong>ForzaTech</strong> proprietary engine technology, while also offering a glimpse of the variety of environments players will be able to explore from the cockpit of their cars once the game ships in less than three months. We can see beaches, small villages, forests, the countryside, and snowy, mountainous regions, among others.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Originally announced at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, Forza Horizon 6 is the direct successor to 2021's award-winning <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong>, which was <strong>the biggest-ever launch for an Xbox Studios game</strong> and kept millions of players engaged for years, even adding a lot more racing fans to the community <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it debuted on Sony's PlayStation 5 console last year</a></strong>.</p>



<p>It won't be easy for the new game to match or exceed its success, but developer Playground is certainly trying. <strong>The map is the franchise's largest to date</strong>, with Tokyo confirmed as <strong>its most complex and intricate drivable space, being five times larger than any previous Horizon city</strong>. Tokyo's rendition in Forza Horizon 6 features multiple districts, each with its own distinct identity, from suburbs and downtown areas to docks and industrial zones. Beyond the city, Mount Fuji and several other regions of Japan have been confirmed, spanning the Kantō, Chūbu, and Kansai areas. As usual with Forza Horizon games, these regions will be compressed into a fictional map rather than reflecting real-life distances.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will feature <strong>over 550 cars</strong> at launch, more than its predecessor but fewer than Forza Horizon 4, which had over 750 when it debuted in 2018. Similar to Forza Horizon 4 and 5, <strong>dynamic seasons return</strong>, with the team building a system that genuinely shifts the world's tone, activity, and ambient sound as seasons change. Japan's famous cherry blossoms, vivid autumn foliage, and snow-capped winter mountains should make the seasonal cycle particularly spectacular in this setting. Game developer Playground Games also brought on cultural consultant <strong>Kyoko Yamashita</strong> to ensure the game's depiction of Japan feels authentic in every respect.</p>



<p>The most notable gameplay departure from previous entries that we know of will be found in campaign progression. Rather than entering the Horizon Festival as an established racer, <strong>players begin as a mere tourist</strong> who must earn their way into the festival and work up through its escalating ranks. </p>



<p>More gameplay information on Forza Horizon 6 is expected to be released in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for more. The game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-reveals-may-19-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on May 19, 2026</a></strong> for PC and Xbox Series S|X, as per a leak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a PlayStation 5 version coming later</a>. </p>

			<p>The <strong>turbulence at Microsoft's Xbox division</strong> continued on Friday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when the company suddenly announced</a> that long-time CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> and current president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> were both <strong>leaving</strong> (the former is retiring, while the latter is pursuing other career opportunities outside Microsoft).</p>



<p>The new CEO of Microsoft Gaming is <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, whose appointment is, however, already being questioned by gamers. The 36-year-old executive <strong>has no prior experience in the gaming industry</strong>; browsing her career, this is actually the second time she's been at Microsoft. She first joined Microsoft in 2011 and worked in the Marketing department for two years, then left to become COO of <strong>Porch Group</strong> (an insurance platform for homes), then returned to the tech industry by joining <strong>Meta</strong> as Head of Product across Messenger + Instagram Direct and GM of calling, video, and kids experiences. </p>



<p>In 2021, she changed companies again, joining the leading grocery technology company <strong>Instacart</strong> as its COO. After three years, she returned to Microsoft as president of the <strong>CoreAI</strong> product, leading the portfolio of AI models, apps, agents, responsible AI, and developer tools for customers.</p>



<p>It's not so much her lack of industry experience that worries gamers, but rather <strong>her previous work in Microsoft's AI division</strong>. Probably aware of this in advance, Sharma included this reassuring bit in her prepared statement:</p>



<p><em>We will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.</em></p>



<p>However, she didn't quite get off to the right start with that. Throughout the weekend, her X account replied to several gamers in an attempt to connect with the Xbox community, but <strong>fans are already pointing out that her answers might actually be crafted by an AI bot</strong>. <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025271504515285467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's an example</a>:</p>



<p><em>Great list. I did my top 3 in another reply. Halo, Valheim, 007. It's been a long time since I played Chrono Trigger. Have you done every ending? Thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it a ton.</em></p>



<p>Furthermore, the new Xbox CEO has shared her Gamertag publicly, and fans quickly noticed a couple of things: it was created last month and already has quite a bit of playtime. She later <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025262170339168355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in a tweet</a> that she's "<strong>no Phil Spencer</strong>", hinting at the previous CEO's renowned gaming habits.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not mandatory for a gaming executive to be a gamer. However, between that, her lack of experience in the industry, and the aforementioned AI skepticism, <strong>Asha Sharma might already have a bit of an uphill battle when it comes to winning over the already downbeat Xbox fans</strong>. </p>



<p>Ultimately, as they say, the proof is in the pudding. If Xbox can output great hardware and software, all this stuff will be quickly forgotten. The lineup for this year (which marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox) is very solid: <strong>Fable</strong>, <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, <strong>Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, though of course, it was inherited from the previous leadership. </p>
