			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth patch is now live on PC, introducing a fix for an AMD Radeon GPUs-specific issue and some improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.00.3 patch, which is around 18.3 GB big for the Steam version of the game, introduces game stability improvements, fixing several unspecified bugs. The new patch also fixes an issue that caused crashes while playing the game using certain AMD Radeon GPUs and reduces the package size when downloading on Steam Deck, which is a great improvement for those who have limited storage space on their systems. Unfortunately, this seems to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2909400/view/527588008025654786?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything the patch does</a>, so it's yet another minor patch that doesn't address the performance issue that many are experiencing.</p>
<p>Considering how the main development team seems to have fully moved on to the development of the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, it's not surprising to see Final Fantasy VII Rebirth not getting any new features. Thankfully, modders have come to the rescue once again, adding features not available in the vanilla game, such as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special menu</a> that allows quick editing of the combat party and even adding Vincent and Cid to the party, although the two characters are not playable.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"> review.</a></p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-free-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-on-march-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a while ago, NCSoft and Amazon are launching the Wilds of Talandre expansion for the MMORPG Throne and Liberty today in Western territories.</p>
<p>This free update adds a ton of new content to the game, starting with the titular new zone of Talandre, which expands the playable space with a region filled with new challenges and rewards. Players can explore the Temple of Truth, face off against powerful new field bosses, and advance their characters to level 55 while new events are slowly unlocked.</p>
<p>Talandre has long been inhospitable to settlement due to its rugged terrain and unusually rampant demonic beasts. However, it later became home to refugees fleeing the oppression of the Crimson Family, who founded the village of Herba. Still, due to the harsh environment and deadly monsters, much of the natural world remains untouched.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre expansion adds Solo dungeons where players can hone their skills before going into Group dungeons, which are also being expanded with the new, more challenging 3-Star dungeons. There are three of them: Rancorwood, Hall of Tragedy, and Chapel of Madness, all of which are unlocked at the new level cap of 55.</p>
<p>If you're more into PvP, the new inter-server Nebula Island is a place where players can engage in PvP and PvE activities in six different regions, including one peaceful zone (Fog Forest) and four war zones where PvP is always enabled. Players can spend up to 7 hours per week on the island, with additional time available through Nebula Charge Stones. Nebula Island will be enabled in a week from now.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre patch also revamps the Weapon mastery system and adds the new Artifact system. With regard to the former, Weapon mastery is now gained independently of which weapon the player has equipped; instead, they now have the option in the UI to select which weapon will receive the Weapon Mastery points. Mastery experience can also be increased through Weapon Mastery Seals acquired from various content. Lastly, Weapon mastery can now grow up to a maximum level of 200 per weapon.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRONE AND LIBERTY: Wilds of Talandre Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHkOc0xoyy4?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As for Artifacts, they can be obtained from Nebula Island and the Abyss dungeons in Talandre. The system consists of six parts: 4 Talistones, a Solarstone and a Lunarstone, each with unique stats and effects. There are 14 different sets across three levels (2 Common, 4 Uncommon, and 8 Rare), with some stats randomly determined upon acquisition. Players can trigger set bonuses by equipping 2, 4, or 6 matching items from the same set. The Solar Stone grants an active ability, while the Lunar Stone grants a passive ability when equipped. Lastly, there are a few additions to the Lifestyle content featured in Throne and Liberty, such as 24 new fish, 10 new cooking recipes, and additional collectibles like the Cornelian Cherry Tree.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre update also improves some aspects of combat and movement in Throne and Liberty. The basic attack range of short-range melee weapons was increased, the movement speed reduction that applied to characters while using attack skills was removed, the player character will be more responsive after using movement skills, and the camera can be rotated when executing skills that previously locked the camera.</p>

			<p>Despite having had a sort of blueprint for decades, top-down action role-playing games are a little hard to get right. Ever since the release of the original Diablo and its wildly more popular sequel, many games have attempted to replicate the experience crafted by Blizzard, and only a handful succeeded at providing satisfying experiences powered by the simple core gameplay loop of exploring dungeons, defeating enemies, obtaining new loot, improving character build to take on even more difficult challenges. Still, <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/">Path of Exile</a> and a few other games proved that it is possible to challenge the dominance of the Diablo series by offering what ARPG players really want, which often involves a good wealth of customization options.</p>
<p>While it is too early to say if Eko Software's Dragonkin: The Banished will indeed be able to offer an experience that will please fans of the genre, the potential is most definitely there. The Early Access version currently only features the very first chapter of the adventure and some endgame activities that will likely get expanded once the game hits its 1.0 version, but what can be experienced is definitely promising, even in its current rough state.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304135423_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As those who tried the game's recent demo already know, Dragonkin: The Banished offers right from the beginning the chance to see the power level that the game's four characters will be able to reach, taking advantage of a prologue that sets the story up, detailing how the world was corrupted by the blood of dragons that is causing monstrous creatures to rise from the depths of the earth. While these characters do fall into the ARPG archetypes that are found in pretty much every game in the genre, they feel diverse enough. The Knight, for example, combines offense and defense for a varied playstyle; the Oracle utilizes elemental magic with different ranges and AOEs while also offering surprisingly good mobility options; the Barbarian hits harder and harder when the Rage value increases, showing his true strength when overwhelmed by enemy hordes. A fourth character that falls into the Ranger/Rogue archetype is also briefly available during the prologue but is not yet available for the main adventure.</p>
<p>While dominating enemies in the prologue using these prebuilt godlike heroes is fun for a short while, the prologue alone doesn't do a great job at highlighting some of the features that set Dragonkin: The Banished apart from similar games, as it only becomes possible to access the main menu, and thus the many customization options the game has to offer, only a few minutes after selecting the character among the Knight, Oracle and Barbarian, and reaching the City of Montescail, which serves as the main hub. One of these features is the Ancestral Grid, a massive grid that comes with different shapes that depend on the character it belongs to, and a huge number of nodes that are progressively unlocked as the character levels up, where it is possible to place Fragments, items collected from enemies that represent character skills and modifiers. What makes this system very interesting is how modifiers all have some pretty unique shapes that fit into multiple nodes and can affect multiple character skills depending on the placement, turning skill customization into a sort of engaging puzzle game that requires some serious optimization to get the best out of any modifier. The modifiers themselves look varied enough, as they grant tons of different properties to skills, including damage and speed boosts, so it definitely feels like the system has a ton of potential, even in its very first iteration.</p>
<p>Another feature that sets Dragonkin: The Banished apart from other ARPGs is the ability to bring a Wyrmling along, a small companion dragon that can be chosen among four different ones that come with their own unique elements, bonus attributes, and skills. Interestingly enough, the Wyrmlings' skills are also placed on the Arcane Grid and can be influenced by regular modifiers, further increasing customization options. In addition, when a character skill is affected by 8 or more modifiers, it enters Symbiosis with the currently equipped Wyrmling, increasing its power and granting it the elemental properties of the companion dragon. Achieving this requires perfect optimization of the Arcane Grid, which further makes the customization system way more involving than simply equipping skills and activating modifiers.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304172246_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even when it comes to its main hub, Dragonkin: The Banished attempts to do something slightly different from the norm. Instead of offering every possible service right at the start of the game, the City of Monstescail will evolve based on its Prosperity Level, which is increased by visiting the world and defeating major Dragons. Besides the Jeweler, who can produce rings with items looted after defeating enemies, the Apothecary, who can upgrade potions, and the Dark Merchant, who buys from the player unwanted items, more services will be added in future versions of the game to give players even more reasons to fully explore the world and increase the city's prosperity.</p>
<p>Despite being in Early Access, Dragonkin: The Banished already offers plenty of replay value, with multiple difficulty levels that also increase rewards and quality of loot, and proper endgame activities like hunts, unique quests of variable durations, difficulty, and rewards, and Dungeon Purification, where the player has to close a rift at the end of dungeons. All of these activities allow the player to push the limits of the current gameplay systems to the maximum, allowing them to get their hands on powerful loot and Fragments, although, with potentially huge changes on the horizon, spending too much time on these activities may not be very worthwhile right now.</p>
<p>The potential big changes coming to Dragonkin: The Banished in the future aren't the only thing that may not make it worthwhile for most players to start playing the game right away in its first iteration. The unfinished user interface, plenty of bugs, including some progression blockers that, at least, are not critical, textures loading in seconds after a new area is loaded, missing resolution options suddenly becoming available, wonky controller support and general lack of the most basic polish are only some of the issues that suggest the game wasn't exactly ready for even an Early Access release, so it may be wise to wait for a few patches before diving in.</p>
<p>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</p>
