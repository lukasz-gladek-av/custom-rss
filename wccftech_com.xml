			<p>We learned yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA had canceled its Black Panther game and shut down the team that was working on it, Cliffhanger Studios</a>. This immediately put into question the status of EA's other Marvel-based projects, like Motive Studios' Iron Man game.</p>
<p>However, according to statements from Marvel and EA that were sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-still-making-at-least-3-marvel-games-even-after-black-panther-cancellation">IGN</a>, the collaboration between the two companies "<em>remains strong,</em>" and EA is still committed to making three games based on Marvel characters, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-marvel-games-partner-3-new-action-adventure-games/">previously agreed to in 2022.</a></p>
<p>Originally, the three games would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">EA Motive's Iron Man game</a>, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game, and a third unannounced title. The Iron Man game is still in development, and, as far as we know right now, is still planned to be released.</p>
<p>"<em>Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues,</em>" said EA Entertainment president Laura Miele in a statement.</p>
<p>For Marvel's part, a spokesperson for the company said, "<em>The multi-title, long-term relationship between Marvel Games and EA, a creative collaboration focused on original storytelling with various, beloved Marvel characters, remains strong. Development of our console and PC titles, beginning with Marvel's Iron Man, is led by Motive Studios</em>."</p>
<p>So after the Iron Man game, it sounds like, at least for now, Motive Studios is on the hook for two more games based on a Marvel character. Whether we actually get those games is another question. If the Iron Man game flops, it wouldn't be surprising if the other projects are canceled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">Marvel's Avengers</a> definitively proved that putting big-name comic book characters in a video game does not guarantee success in today's MCU-led market.</p>
<p>But that's the less likely scenario, since Motive has an incredibly talented team and there are no signs that it will try to mash a bunch of unwanted live service-focused features into its <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">single-player</a> Iron Man game.</p>
<p>Which seemingly puts Motive Studios in a similar position to Respawn, with both studios locked into making three games based on Disney-owned franchises. Once the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">third Star Wars Jedi</a> title from Respawn and the third Marvel game from Motive are out, EA might finally move entirely away from making games based on licensed series, as chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">Andrew Wilson talked about</a>. Sorry to all <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront III</a> hopefuls.</p>
