			<p>A new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/">Variety</a> reveals that a television series adaptation of Wolfenstein is in the works at Amazon MGM Studios, with Fallout producer Patrick Somerville signed on as the show's creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner.</p>



<p>While Variety notes that there aren't any details being given out yet regarding what the show's story will be, the tagline for the show is "<em>The story of killing Nazis is evergreen</em>."</p>



<p>Jerk Gustafsson, who is currently an executive producer at <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-might-have-canceled-an-unannounced-project/">MachineGames</a> and has worked as either a game designer, writer, producer, or managing director on all of MachineGames' Wolfenstein titles, is also attached to the show as an executive producer. </p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what shape this show takes. Variety's report adds that Somerville has been a fan of the Wolfenstein series since he was a kid, but with the series spanning 14 games, that doesn't necessarily mean he adores or even prefers MachineGames' take on the series.</p>



<p>That said, Somerville coming from Amazon's successful adaptation of Fallout does inspire a great deal of confidence. And hopefully for game fans, the potential success of the show is part of a plan to go along with MachineGames returning to the series.</p>

			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1948756850171662413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has registered over 9 million players since its launch on April 22. The developer shared the news with a brief message and a picture of the iconic 'adoring fan', a Wood Elf commoner who becomes the player character's "groupie" once they have become the new Grand Champion in the Arena. The adoring fan's hair has been styled into a nine for the occasion.</p>



<p><em>To everyone who emerged as a hero of Kvatch, mastered Arch-Mage, rose to Grand Champion, banished the Blackwood Company, gallivanted as the Gray Fox, and listened to the Night.</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for sharing in our worlds. ❤️</em></p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered immediately garnered the attention of Elder Scrolls fans, <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking the four million player milestone in just two days of its release</a>. Of course, the fact that it is available on Game Pass across Xbox Series S|X and PC undoubtedly helped a great deal.</p>



<p>Even so, game industry analytics firm Newzoo <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the game delivered 'outstanding revenue performance' and became a benchmark for future remasters. Circana had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified</a> that Oblivion Remastered was the best-selling game of April 2025 in the United States across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, all this success was not enough to prevent Virtuos, the developer behind the remaster, from <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-developer-virtuos-confirms-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cutting nearly 280 employees</a> across its European and Asian offices. It is unclear how these layoffs will impact the game's future support. The game has notoriously inherited the original title's performance issues while roaming the open world, specifically the near-constant hitching. While Update 1.2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-patch-1-2-30-fps-rtx-5080-native-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought some improvements</a>, there's still a lot of room for further fixes in this regard. A much improved performance would certainly make exploration even better in a game that is all about that type of gameplay experience, like most titles in the Elder Scrolls franchise. </p>

			<p>KRAFTON, the publisher that has more recently been in the news due to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">messy back-and-forth</a> with the co-founders of Unknown Worlds, who allege that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">KRAFTON delayed Subnautica 2 to avoid paying a $250 million bonus</a> to the Unknown Worlds team, is back in the news for a different reason today, a studio acquisition. Eleventh Hour Games, the team behind Last Epoch, has just been acquired by KRAFTON.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/last-epoch-qa-on-runemaster-class-1-0-launch-and-advantages-over-diablo-iv/">Eleventh Hour Games</a> (EHG) was founded back in 2017, with chief executive officer Judd Cobler going to Reddit to find people with game development experience to make what would become Last Epoch. A 2018 Kickstarter raised enough funds to get the studio going, and on April 30, 2019, it launched into Early Access on Steam. It didn't hit its <a href="https://wccftech.com/last-epoch-shows-off-unique-trade-system-ahead-of-1-0-launch/">1.0 launch</a> until just last year, February 21, 2024, and according to a <a href="https://press.krafton.com/KRAFTON-Acquires-Eleventh-Hour-Games-Creators-of-Last-Epoch">press release</a> for its acquisition by KRAFTON, Last Epoch has sold 3 million copies since last February.</p>



<p>"<em>Through this acquisition, KRAFTON aims to secure a competitive franchise IP in the Action RPG genre and further strengthen its position in the global market," </em>writes KRAFTON. "<em>The deal provides EHG with the resources and infrastructure to better serve its community, ensuring that Last Epoch</em> <em>continues to evolve and meet the expectations of its growing player base. The acquisition will also enable EHG to scale development across console platforms and expand seasonal content pipelines, setting the stage for long-term franchise development. KRAFTON will support EHG’s live service roadmap, team expansion, and international publishing, while allowing the studio to retain full leadership and creative autonomy</em>."</p>



<p>KRAFTON's head of corporate development, Maria Park, added that the publisher is "<em>thrilled to welcome Eleventh Hour Games into the KRAFTON family,"</em> and that EHG's "<em>rise from a grassroots studio to a globally renowned ARPG developer is nothing short of remarkable."</em> Park also claims that this acquisition "<em>reaffirms our unwavering passion for great games and the teams that build them. We will always stand behind developers who put players first,"</em> which is difficult to see as anything but a snide shot towards the Subnautica 2 co-founders. </p>



<p>On the other side of the aisle, for Eleventh Hour Games, Cobler adds that this acquisition is "<em>a dream come true</em>" for the studio, and that KRAFTON's "<em>deep-rooted passion for ARPGs aligns perfectly with our mission."</em> </p>



<p>"<em>With KRAFTON's support, EHG is poised to elevate the </em><em>Last Epoch</em> franchise to even greater heights. As a studio built from players of the genre, we couldn’t be more excited for its future."</p>



<p>Due to the ongoing legal battle between KRAFTON and Unknown Worlds, it's difficult to take any of these statements at face value when we see how that relationship has eroded in the last four years. Unknown Worlds co-founder Charlie Cleveland also said that Unknown Worlds and KRAFTON were "<em>aligned</em>" in their goals when <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">KRAFTON's acquisition of Unknown Worlds was announced</a>. But, according to Cleveland and the rest of the co-founders, KRAFTON's attitude towards the studio turned on a dime within the last year. </p>



<p>Hopefully, today's statements remain true for Eleventh Hour Games and KRAFTON in the future.</p>
