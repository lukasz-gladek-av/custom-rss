			<p>The Complete RT shader and a selection of other visual improvements make Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater look stunning, making its visual more realistic and its lighting closer to path tracing quality.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, known modder <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MassiHancer">MassiHancer</a> showcased the remake of the third entry in the series by KONAMI released last month on PC and consoles running with the Complete RT shader and ReSTIR G.I., which deliver path tracing quality with enhanced global illumination, ambient occlusion, tessellation, color grading and depth of field. The video also includes a few comparisons that highlight the significant improvements introduced to the game by the shader over the game's native Lumen.</p>

<p>Although the game suffers from performance and stability issues that are being addressed with <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-patch-gameplay-issues-crashes/">post-launch updates</a>, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a solid remake of one of the best entries in the series created by Hideo Kojima. The faithful recreation of what is, still today, one of the finest stealth games ever released, and the addition of Legacy Style for purists and New Style for newcomers makes this remake a solid purchase for all sorts of players, as highlighted by Kai in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/"> review.</a></p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is reportedly the next Xbox exclusive to launch on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today, Polish publication <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/383315/wiemy-jaki-kolejny-ex-microsoftu-trafi-na-ps5-co-z-pudelkami-oblivion-remastered.html">PPE</a> revealed that the latest entry in the Microsoft series will make its debut on PlayStation 5 sometime this November. No other information about this new edition of the game has been revealed besides the fact that it will receive a retail release alongside the digital release on the PlayStation Network.</p>



<p>Although its PlayStation 5 release has yet to be confirmed, there's a good chance that PPE's report is correct, as Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has been repeatedly mentioned by <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">reliable leakers</a> as one of the Xbox exclusives that will launch on other platforms before the end of the year, alongside other titles such as Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Starfield, whose PS5 debut is rumored to have<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/"> moved to 2026</a>. With the Tokyo Game Show right around the corner, there's a very good chance we won't have to wait too long to learn if the game is indeed launching on PlayStation 5 before the end of the year.</p>



<p>If Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches on PlayStation 5 this year, it will be only the latest among many other former Xbox exclusives that have made the jump to the Sony current-generation system. Among them are Sea of Thieves, Grounded, and Forza Horizon 5. The multiplatform strategy seems to be working out, as some of these former Xbox exclusives are doing great on Sony's consoles, so much so that<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/"> Forza Horizon 5 is currently the best-selling 2025 PS5 game to </a>, an impressive feat to accomplish for a game already available on other platforms.</p>
