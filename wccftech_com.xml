			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation</a> of the long-awaited ZeniMax Online Studios (ZOS from now on) MMORPG codenamed Project Blackbird and the subsequent departure of studio founder and head Matt Firor shocked the development team, which is understandably still reeling. </p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1940751846064443838?t=Dwxr4abCb3L_nCifN6JyUA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hundreds of developers lost their jobs</a>, including ZOS Lead Graphics Programmer Alex Tardif, who had worked at the company for over ten years and was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-tech-qa-improved-next-gen-usage-better-hdr-multithreaded-rendering-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured</a> in an exclusive The Elder Scrolls Online tech interview with Wccftech in August 2021. Following the dire news, Tardif <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346200504034623489/">shared</a> some thoughts on LinkedIn, stating that the MMORPG was 'heading in a great direction' and the new engine he and the other graphics programmers had been working on had 'found its footing'.</p>



<p><em>Our project got cancelled. We'd been working on a new engine + MMO for some time now, and despite some troubles along the way, the project was heading in a great direction and our tech had found its footing. Of the high notes of our tech was undoubtedly our new renderer, made by one of the best damn graphics teams around. If you see any of them looking for work in the coming days/weeks, they have my full throttled endorsement. An entire team of humble, hardworking, self motivated and passionate devs bleeding with talent. You could not go wrong hiring any of them.</em></p>



<p>Now, I'm the first to be entirely flummoxed at the news. As someone who spent thousands of hours in The Elder Scrolls Online, I was very much looking forward to this new game by ZOS, and I'm extremely sad about all the job cuts. On the other hand, if one wanted to play devil's advocate for a second, it is also true that the project had been cooking for over seven years and they didn't have anything to show for it, at least to the public. Even the fact that tech had just about 'found its footing' isn't exactly inspiring in that regard - likely, Microsoft decided that they weren't willing to spend any more resources on such a slow-going project.</p>



<p>Again, though, it's a shame, as so few triple-A MMORPGs are being built nowadays. We're down to less than a handful that are being worked on by Western developers now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann has announced that he is stepping back from his role with HBO's The Last Of Us to bring his full focus back to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including the studio's upcoming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a statement from Druckmann and Naughty Dog on the <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">official X account</a> for the studio. "<em>I've made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in The Last of Us on HBO,</em>" Druckmann began. </p>



<div><p>"<em>With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative.</em></p><p><em>Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It's been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I'm deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting The Last of Us Part I and the continued adaptation of The Last of Us Part II</em>."</p></div>



<figure></figure>



<p>Since HBO began working on its adaptation of The Last of Us, Druckmann has been straddling his work at Naughty Dog with work on the show. He's written and directed episodes alongside his duties as an executive producer, and been the co-showrunner alongside Craig Mazin over the course of the first two seasons. With Druckmann stepping away from the show, Naughty Dog is officially not meaningfully involved in how HBO's adaptation of The Last of Us Part II continues with season 3 and beyond.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if Druckmann returns to the show to direct an episode here or there in season 3 or season 4, or if he really is watching from the sidelines for the rest of the adaptation. That he's made this announcement at all is also a bit surprising, considering how involved he's been so far. His first responsibility was always to Naughty Dog, so perhaps it became evident that he could no longer dedicate time to the show while things ramped up at Naughty Dog on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>



<p>If that is the case, then that raises questions as to how successful Druckmann was at being able to juggle his duties at Naughty Dog and on the show, and if this decision to step back from the show is due to him ultimately being unable to properly balance the two. That's all just speculation of course, and we'll likely never know the real truth of the matter, but for Druckmann to leave before the job is done on the adaptation, so to speak, shows that he had to make a choice about where he's spending his time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy CEO Leslie Benzies reportedly finally addressed staff after the launch of MindsEye, blaming internal and external saboteurs for the game's and the studio's current struggles.</p>



<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"> IGN</a>, the former producer of the Grand Theft Auto series addressed staff at the development studio yesterday, July 2, in a short video call. During the call, the Build a Rocket Boy CEO insisted the studio would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye while blaming both the game's and the studio's struggles to internal and external saboteurs. This is the second time a similar suggestion was made by a BARB exec, as last month, co-CEO Mark Gerhard talked about a supposed concerted effort by some to trash the game and the studio.</p>



<p>Though there seems to be plans to relaunch MindsEye at some point, things are looking dire at the studio. At-risk emails have been sent to around 300 employees at Build a Rocket Boy and to staff at PlayFusion, which was acquired by BARB in late 2024. As such, the situation seems to be far worse than what it seemed<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> last month</a>, when it was confirmed that a layoff process began at the studio.</p>



<p>Few should be surprised to see MindsEye becoming more and more one of the most disastrous game launches of all time. The writing was on the wall even before release, when two BARB chief executives left the studio a few days before the release of the game. With a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">technical</a> and gameplay issues, relaunching the game will be a real challenge, and with layoffs looming on the horizon at the development studio, it remains to be seen if there are real plans to do so and how they will be realized.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is expected to have sold well in its first week of availability, moving close to 1.5 million units in just a few days.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/us-consumers-will-cut-back-on-buying">The Game Business</a>, market research and analytics firm Ampere estimates that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach sold 1.4 million copies by the end of June in one week of availability. The game had a slower start than its predecessor in terms of physical copies across Europe, but digital sales are reportedly stronger. Considering how the original game continued to sell well even years after its launch, the second entry in the series by Kojima Productions seems set to become a success.</p>



<p>Although Death Stranding 2: On The Beach doesn't significantly shake up its predecessor's formula, the huge number of quality-of-life additions and the much faster pace make it a more accessible and ultimately more enjoyable experience. Stealth and combat have also been improved significantly, and by taking advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-make-stealth-and-combat-way-more-enjoyable-with-this-one-game-changing-trick/">a mechanic</a> that is not properly explained in-game, the entire experience turns into the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V we never got.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is now available on PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review-in-progress.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-bricking-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-challenged-in-brazil/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-ability-to-brick-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-is-being-challenged-in-brazil.1235190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo was clearly determined to improve some of the core failings of the original Nintendo Switch, including how easy it was for players to get pirated software onto the console. In the beginning, all it took was a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44106-nintendo-switch-hack">paper clip</a> to dismantle the Nintendo Switch, while Nintendo could do nothing but watch, and eventually release an updated model of the original Switch to stop the paper clip trick from working.</p>



<p>Nintendo has upped its game, so to speak, in its fight against piracy on the Nintendo Switch 2, with the threat of Nintendo bricking the device remotely hanging over the head of anyone willing to try and use their Switch 2 in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/">"<em>unauthorized</em>" way</a>. Players have described this kind of power to brick the whole device and not just ban the account of someone attempting to jailbreak their console as an overreach from Nintendo, but individual players can't exactly do much to get in Nintendo's way over it.</p>



<p>Procon-SP, however, is trying to get in Nintendo's way on behalf of Brazilian Nintendo Switch 2 owners. The Sau Paulo branch of Brazil's Consumer Protection and Defense organization has <a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/">published a press release</a> (spotted by <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/02/brazil-nintendo-is-now-facing-legal-action-over-ability-to-brick-switch-2-console/">My Nintendo News</a>) in which it calls the clauses around bricking the device in the contract that every Nintendo Switch 2 owner and Nintendo Switch Online account holder agrees to "<em>abusive</em>."</p>



<p>To be clear, Procon-SP's issues with Nintendo are more around how the company can remotely and permanently cut off services that Brazilian consumers have paid for without a proper explanation. Procon-SP is asking that Nintendo change the wording in its EULA per its requests, with Nintendo now saying it will review Procon-SP's complaint and respond within the next 20 days. Nintendo's current EULA reads "<em>You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions, Nintendo may render the Console and/or the Software permanently unusable in whole or in part</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see if Nintendo changes the wording, or if Procon-SP takes this complaint even further, prompting potential legal action.</p>
