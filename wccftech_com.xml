			<p>In just over two weeks, Obsidian will release The Outer Worlds 2, the second triple-A RPG of its outstanding year (which also includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-wuchang-fallen-feathers-robocop-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access launch of Grounded 2</a>) after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a>.</p>



<p>As we get closer to launch, Game Director Brandon Adler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v9_FNFEm0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Danny Peña</a> and discussed how this sequel improves upon the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 original</a>, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-has-way-more-expansive-worlds-filled-with-fun-stories-and-cool-stuff-to-find-says-obsidian/">bigger worlds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-features-much-greater-reactivity-and-third-person-view-says-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greater reactivity</a>, and deeper RPG mechanics. The latter was a particular focus area, as Adler openly said that roleplaying games fans are looking for deeper games.</p>



<p><em>I would say that the biggest thing for me is that players want deeper RPGs. I think a lot of time there's the thought just being in this industry for so long, being in RPGs for so long, it seems like in many cases we've tried to smooth down the rough edges and streamline things a little bit. And that's fine for some games, but also players just really want to be able to get in there. They want to just be able to get the crunchy number stuff, but also just make all the different types of builds they can. They want all of the RPG options that a lot of times we've been kind of slowly removing or streamlining and slimming down. So I think, again, that the big lesson from the first game to the second is let's give the players those options. Let's give them that stuff to interact with, and I think that they'll be appreciative of that. </em></p>



<p><em>The Outer Worlds 2 is the first time I've been a game director on a major project. I've done game direction before on DLCs, in particular for Pillars of Eternity: Deadfire. I was working on those, but this is the first time I've had a larger project to work on. For me, it’s been, again, I think looking back toward old Obsidian games and the style of game we used to do a lot and kind of just, all right, well, how can we bring that back to the forefront, modernize a little bit, but really get back to those sensibilities of a really strong RPG that really focuses on player agency and player choice and the consequences of those things and just making sure that all of our content really leans into that like that. That’s been the thing that’s been a lot of fun for me.</em></p>



<p>Being a big fan of deep RPGs, I'm really glad about that. The first The Outer Worlds was certainly a bit lacking in this area, and the enormous success of Baldur's Gate 3 demonstrates that Adler is correct about the audience's desires. I didn't quite notice those deeper mechanics in the preview demo, but then again, that was just the game's prologue. </p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is out on October 29 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a <a href="https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1887907/Principal-Unreal-Engineer%2C-Gameplay---World's-Edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job listing posted this week</a>, a new Age of Empires game is in development at World's Edge. This, by itself, is no big surprise, since Microsoft's historic real-time strategy franchise has enjoyed a quiet renaissance in the last few years. Between 2018 and 2024, all previous installments have received their own Definitive Editions and/or remasters, of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> is just the latest. Most of them, especially Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, are still getting new DLC, too.</p>



<p>However, unless they're going for a full-fledged remake of an existing game that was already remastered, chances are this is going to be a brand new game. The biggest surprise from that job listing, though, is that it reveals that the title will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology.</p>



<p><em>At Xbox Game Studios, we are hard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires, our beloved RTS (Real Time Strategy) franchise. We are a passionate group responsible for this amazing franchise and are expanding our team looking for a wonderful colleague that will be responsible for planning and building our future tech stack. We are looking for a Principal Unreal Engineer with background in all aspects of Unreal Engine game development and experience leading external resources.</em></p>



<p>Internet sleuths have also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o3ylx1/more_evidence_about_worlds_edge_studio_behind_age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> the LinkedIn page of World's Edge Principal Build Lead Engineer, which tells us that the team has been developing a triple-A pipeline support for 'unannounced titles using Unreal Engine 5', plural. This particular developer has been with World's Edge since December 2023.</p>



<p>The first candidate is, of course, Age of Empires V. The fourth mainline installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did well enough</a>, receiving several awards for the best strategy game released in 2021. Its fourth expansion, Dynasties of the East, will release on November 4 (the same date as <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-announces-two-titles-coming-to-playstation-5-updates-and-expansions-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's debut on PlayStation 5</a>), adding Golden Horde, Macedonian Dynasty, Sengoku Daimyo, and Tughlaq Dynasty as well as a roguelite single player mode.</p>



<p>Age of Empires IV was developed by Relic Entertainment. As far as we know, World's Edge is not big enough to make a new installment on its own, so it'll be interesting to see if they partner with Relic once again. As a reminder, the Vancouver-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became independent from SEGA in March 2024</a>.</p>

			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a major update</a> to their Project Amethyst collaboration (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally unveiled in December 2024</a>) this past week in a video featuring PlayStation Lead Architect Mark Cerny and AMD SVP and GM of the Computing and Graphics Group Jack Huynh. The duo presented three major new features, Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression, which will be coming to future AMD GPUs and consoles like Sony's PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>The video was only about nine minutes long, though, and inevitably left viewers with plenty of questions. Thankfully, the folks from Digital Foundry got a few answers from Mark Cerny via an email Q&amp;A and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru7dK_X5tnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted them in their latest video</a>, where they also discussed the aforementioned features.</p>



<p>Firstly, when asked about the change in Sony's hardware and software strategy from the PlayStation 5 Pro to the next PlayStation console, Mark Cerny said Project Amethyst would bring about a monumental shift:</p>



<p><em>We've shifted our focus substantially. In the past, we were largely creating custom technologies just for PlayStation platforms. But now with Project Amethyst, we're placing substantially more of a focus on co-engineering and co-development with AMD on their roadmap hardware and libraries. That change will have a very large impact, because when developers can create their technology with the understanding that it will work across multiple platforms such as desktops, laptops, consoles, etc., there will be much larger pickup of new features. So I believe we'll see outsized impact from the technologies announced this past week!</em></p>



<p>Having said that, the PlayStation Lead Architect also admitted that any sort of quantification of the benefits brought by technologies like Universal Compression and Radiance Cores will have to wait until game developers actually implement them in their engines (when it comes to the former) or have access to the new hardware (when it comes to the latter).</p>



<p><em>With these technologies, we know that great stuff is coming but it’s difficult (or impossible) to quantify. For Universal Compression, I have high hopes for synergies with ML, for example, FSR and PSSR are recurrent neural networks that write feature maps to system memory - how well will those feature maps compress? Radiance Cores are similar, they are obviously a great way to do the processing, but I suspect we'Il need to get prototypes into the hands of game developers to understand the degree to which they will be able to “level up their engines.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, in the video announcement, Mark Cerny had stressed that all these features 'only exist in simulation right now', meaning it will take time before developers get to play with them.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The PlayStation Lead Architect also shared a couple more interesting tidbits in the email exchange with Digital Foundry. First, he agreed that Universal Compression is particularly important because it's becoming increasingly complex to achieve significant memory bandwidth increases from generation to generation. Secondly, he confirmed that Sony (and, by extension, AMD) is particularly interested in boosting machine learning and ray tracing for their next hardware compared to regular rasterization, which will get some improvements 'where possible' but is clearly not the focus anymore.</p>



<p>This ties nicely with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/">PlayStation 6 specs rumor</a> that mentioned 'only' a 2.5x to 3x rasterization improvement from the PlayStation 5, whereas ray tracing would be 6x to 12x faster in the new console (which, according to leaker Kepler, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony plans to launch in 2027</a>).</p>
