			<p><strong>Valve,</strong> the studio that was once known for making world-class games like <strong>Half-Life</strong> and <strong>Left 4 Dead</strong>, but is lately simply known as the people behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/">Steam</a></strong> and hardware like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-is-already-planned-confirms-gabe-newell/">Steam Deck</a></strong> and the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/it-just-works-steam-machine-verified-badge-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-verification-to-no-ones-surprise/">Steam Machine</a></strong>, is facing a similar ire to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/epic-v-apple/"><strong>Apple</strong> faced in its legal bout with <strong>Epic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The <strong><a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2026-01/16407724%20Vicki%20Shotbolt%20Class%20Representative%20Limited%20v%20Valve%20Corporation%20-%20Judgment%20%28CPO%20Application%29%20%2026%20Jan%202026.pdf">London Competition Appeal Tribunal</a></strong> has declared that Valve must face a massive <strong>£656 million class-action lawsuit</strong>, arguing that the company takes an "<em><strong>excessive</strong></em>" <strong>30% revenue cut</strong> of every transaction made on Steam.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/valve-to-face-uk-class-action-lawsuit-with-proposed-damages-of-656m">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/video-game-giant-valve-facing-uk-lawsuit-over-pricing-commissions-2026-01-26/">Reuters</a>), this lawsuit initially began with <strong>Vicki Shotbolt</strong>, chief executive officer of <strong>Parent Zone</strong>, filing the suit in 2024. At the time, Shotbolt said, "<em>Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers</em>," and that she filed the claim in an attempt "<em>to stop this unlawful conduct and have people get back what they are owed</em>."</p>



<p>The suit represents some <strong>14 million UK gamers</strong>, as it claims that the 30% commission Valve takes on every purchase is "<em>Imposing <strong>excessive commission charges</strong> which amount to an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers</em>." It also claims that Valve utilizes "<em>anti-steering provisions</em>," which amount to tactics used by Valve to keep customers on Steam, exemplified by the fact that when you purchase a game on Steam, you must also purchase any DLC or add-on content on Steam to use said content.</p>



<p>If some of this, namely the claim that Valve's 30% cut is "<em>excessive</em>," feels familiar to you, that's because back in 2021, <strong>Wolfire Studios</strong> and <strong>Dark Catt Studios</strong> filed a similar case against Valve. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-and-sony-sued-for-establishing-digital-monopolies-with-their-stores/">Wolfire was the first to file its suit back in April 2021</a>, which also pinned the same claim against <strong>Sony</strong> with regard to the <strong>PlayStation Store</strong>. Dark Catt Studios filed its suit months later in June 2021, with Wolfire's suit ultimately being dismissed, and only some of the claims made by Dark Catt Studios getting tossed out.</p>



<p>While Dark Catt's suit continued, Wolfire reorganized its arguments and re-filed its suit against Valve. Due to the cases being so similar, they were combined in July 2022, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/">then in November 2024, the combined suit was given class-action status</a>.</p>



<p>Suits like this always take a while to reach a conclusion, so don't hold your breath on this making an impact on the video game industry anytime soon. That said, the potential ramifications of Valve losing a suit like this are monumental and cannot be understated. A Valve loss might even mean that company head<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/"> <strong>Gabe Newell</strong> needs to cut back on his <strong>super yacht budget</strong></a>.</p>

			<p>As promised by <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, the new <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong> feature is now publicly available via an update released for the <strong>NVIDIA app</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-soon-add-dynamic-fx-responds-to-in-game-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced earlier this month at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> for a late January release, RTX Remix Logic enables modders to <strong>dynamically trigger graphics effects in direct response to real-time in-game events</strong>. Critically, it achieves this without requiring source code or engine access, which would otherwise make it a dealbreaker in most cases.</p>



<p>NVIDIA says there are <strong>over 30 in-game events</strong> that can be triggered, such as:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Event Category</th><th data-align="left">Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Player state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Camera position, camera zoom, player world coordinates</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>World bounding boxes</strong></td><td data-align="left">Indoor/outdoor detection, region-specific triggers</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Object state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Any tracked object's position, visibility, and proximity to the player</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Time flow</strong></td><td data-align="left">In-game time of day, elapsed real-time</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Input</strong></td><td data-align="left">Specific key presses by the player</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p> These triggers can manipulate <strong>over 900 RTX Remix graphics parameters</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lighting conditions (time of day, color temperature, intensity)</li>



<li>Weather systems (rain, snow, fog density, volumetric effects)</li>



<li>Material properties (displacement, reflectivity, emissiveness)</li>



<li>Post-processing effects (chromatic aberration, bloom, vignette)</li>



<li>Path-traced volumetrics (smoke, atmospheric scattering)</li>
</ul>



<p>You won't even need to be a professional coder to add RTX Remix Logic to your mods. <strong>NVIDIA has introduced an accessible, no-code node-based interface</strong> where modders can easily drag-and-drop nodes representing triggers and actions, connect cause and effect relationships visually, fine-tune parameters with dedicated sliders and dropdowns, and finally preview all the changes they've made in real time within the Remix editor. More crafty RTX Remix modders will even be able to <strong>create and share custom event triggers</strong>, and new action nodes can be added via plugins, making the framework heavily extensible.</p>



<p>NVIDIA's demo was created in <strong>Half-Life 2 RTX</strong>, where RTX Remix Logic can trigger a '<strong>Ravenholm multiverse</strong>' whenever the player opens a specific door, as shown below. There are many RTX Remix mods in development (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we reported a new one for <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong> just yesterday</a>); it will be interesting to see which modders decide to add this new system to their mod projects. According to NVIDIA, RTX Remix Logic can be added to <strong>over 165 classic PC games</strong>.</p>

<p>Today, NVIDIA also shared a small update on new games that support its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) set of technologies. <strong>Half Sword</strong>, a physics-based medieval combat simulator scheduled to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will debut with built-in support for <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> with the option to upgrade <strong>Super Resolution</strong> to the second-generation <strong>DLSS 4.5</strong> transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong>, which is out now in advanced access (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find our review here</a>), supports DLSS Super Resolution. The same goes for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released free-to-play PvP raid shooter <strong>Highguard</strong></a>, in which GeForce RTX owners can also upgrade Super Resolution to DLSS 4.5 via the app.</p>
