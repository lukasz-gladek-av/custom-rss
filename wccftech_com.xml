			<p>If you thought Elden Ring Nightreign was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">difficult before</a>, then tomorrow's new "<em>high difficulty</em>" mode called Deep of Night won't improve your standing with the game. FromSoftware debuted the new game mode today ahead of its arrival tomorrow.</p>



<p>The new mode makes the whole experience more difficult with enemies that hit harder and Nightlords that you won't be able to prepare for by selecting them ahead of your session. You'll just have to be ready for whatever comes your way, and you'll also be continuously delving deeper into difficulty levels the longer you survive.</p>

<p>All that said, you won't be left to fight these increased challenges with the same weapons you use in the rest of the game. Your weapons will also get a boost, but it'll come at a cost, since weapons you pick up will also have detrimental effects that could prove to do more harm than good.</p>



<p>The right build, however, that's smartly put together can help you steamroll even the more difficult enemies you'll face in the Deep of Night mode.</p>



<p>Depth Relics are another new element added to the Deep of Night game mode, and are only available in Deep of Night. These new, stronger relics can be used in combination with your other relics, since they are each slotted into three new places. </p>



<p>All together, Deep of Night is clearly only for those players looking for the next level of challenge in Elden Ring Nightreign. Try it out at your own risk.</p>
