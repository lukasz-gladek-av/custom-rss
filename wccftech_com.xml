			<p>Throughout the marketing phase of <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> kept quiet about a few things. One was famously <strong>the presence of Leon Kennedy as a playable character</strong>, which leaker Dusk Golem swore about for a long time but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained unconfirmed until last month</a>. </p>



<p>Another was <strong>the zombies</strong>, the key enemy in the whole series. How would they look? What would they behave like? It was only recently that the developers finally opened up about this. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-zombies-are-unpredictable-in-ways-the-series-hasnt-tried-before/1100-6537627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a fresh interview with Gamespot</a>, Game Director Koshi Nakanishi unveiled the twist: to make them more unpredictable, CAPCOM <strong>has ensured they retain some of their human behavior</strong>.</p>



<p><em>When making a Resident Evil title, the question of how to present zombies is always something that comes up in discussions. You want to have some variety, but at the same time, if you make too many changes, it doesn't feel like a zombie anymore, so there's always that element or that challenge of designing enemies for a Resident Evil title. In this setting, you're dealing with a lot of zombies who literally just became zombies momentarily or a while ago. It's pretty fresh.</em></p>



<p><em>Part of that fear experience is not knowing what the enemy is going to do when they approach you or when you see them, and so if you just had a standard zombie, you probably by now have an idea of what a zombie's going to do. But if you had these zombies here that retained some of their memories or behavior from their previous life, then there's more of a mystery element. You're not exactly sure what they're going to do.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly an interesting concept. Over the course of the series, zombies did become a bit trite and less scary than they were at first. Will this change in Resident Evil Requiem be enough to make players fear them once again? We'll know in a month when the game will be released across all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>

			<p>The free-to-play PvP 'raid shooter' <strong>Highguard</strong> was released yesterday on PC and consoles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as covered in our previous article</a>. Right away, it reached a peak of around <strong>97K concurrent players</strong> on <strong>Steam</strong>, though that's not so big considering that the game is free. Perhaps the poor reception <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when the game was unveiled at <strong>Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>, as the final trailer of that show, played a part.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/ultimately-we-could-have-made-a-different-trailer-highguard-ceo-responds-to-that-poorly-received-game-awards-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with PC Gamer</a>, Wildlight Entertainment CEO and founder Dusty Welch acknowledged that it was the team's responsibility to make a better trailer to show off their own game:</p>



<p><em>Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better. Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback.</em></p>



<p><em>I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think The Game Awards was about. We could have made something that did a better job of highlighting the unique loop of the game. So that's on us. We take that, but the team is resilient.</em></p>



<p>The development team has a far bigger issue than the trailer, though. Now that the game is out, <strong>it's being ripped apart in user reviews on Steam</strong>, which are currently <strong>'Mostly Negative'</strong> with only around <strong>32%</strong> giving Highguard a thumbs up.</p>



<p>One of the most common criticisms is that <strong>the game map is way too large</strong>, especially in the current 3v3 format. Players believe teams should be at least 5v5, if not 10v10. Some users are also complaining about the game's PC optimization. The game runs on Unreal Engine 5, by the way.</p>



<p><strong>Highguard is definitely not off to a good start</strong>, that's for sure. However, <strong>we've seen live service games make comebacks before</strong>. It's tough, but if the developers work hard at it while following the community's feedback, it's doable. We'll keep an eye on future updates and revamps to see how it goes for this new game.</p>

			<p><strong>CAPCOM</strong> has released a final <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> media blast ahead of the game's planned launch in late February. Speaking <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2026/01/27/20260127-requiem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with the Japanese PlayStation Blog</a>, CAPCOM Director <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong> outlined the <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro modes</strong> that users equipped with the more powerful console will be able to choose from: <strong>ray tracing at 60 frames per second</strong> or <strong>up to 120 frames per second (with an average of 90 FPS) without ray tracing</strong>.</p>



<p><em>When playing on PS5 Pro, you can take advantage of the ray tracing on/off feature. When it's on, you can play at 4K output, 60fps, and full ray tracing. When it's off, those with a monitor that supports high frame rates can play at a maximum of 120fps, with an average of 90fps. We've spent a lot of time optimizing it.</em></p>



<p><em>What personally impressed me about the PS5 Pro was its high frame rate. You might be wondering if you can really tell the difference, but when you go back to 60fps, it still feels a bit lacking. The difference in the amount of information makes the world seem more persuasive.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, Nakanishi also mentioned how the developers of Resident Evil Requiem have utilized the unique <strong>DualSense controller features</strong> (haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and controller speaker) to augment the player's immersion.</p>



<p><em>We utilize these features to create a sense of horror. For example, if you get killed by a zombie, you'll end up getting bitten, and we made sure that you can feel the texture of your arm being grabbed and the sensation of being bitten in your hands holding the controller through haptic feedback.</em></p>



<p><em>Of course, the trigger weight when firing a gun also changes for each gun, thanks to the adaptive trigger. Reloading a gun also causes vibrations and a sound to be emitted from the controller's microphone. When solving puzzles by spinning a box containing jewels, the feeling of the jewels rattling inside is recreated through vibrations and sounds from the controller, making the game world feel even more realistic and immersive.</em></p>



<p>These should hopefully be available on PC as well when using the DualSense to play the game. </p>



<p>Lastly, YouTuber Punish has uploaded <strong>a new gameplay video of nearly eighteen minutes featuring Leon Kennedy</strong>, one of the game's two protagonists, who was kept secret (at least officially) <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until last month</a>.
