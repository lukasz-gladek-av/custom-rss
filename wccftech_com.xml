			<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by The Verge, Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 Studios was among those hit the hardest in the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive round of Microsoft layoffs</a>. </p>



<p>The sources cited by the publication suggest the 'majority' of the employees were fired. The number given was more than 70. As a result, the remaining employees would be just enough to continue supporting the latest Forza Motorsport game, which launched in October 2023 to positive critic reviews. Our own Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> at the time:</p>



<p><em>While Forza Motorsport is a good game with more than enough things going for it, there's something that just isn't that exciting. Forza Motorsport is a good game, and it's a return to form for the core Forza series - one that seriously faltered while the Horizon spinoff went from strength to strength. If, for an odd reason, you have yet to pick this up on Game Pass (or otherwise), then take this as a recommendation. Forza Motorsport is a very good racing game, a return to form for the series, and a good sign for the future of the series.</em></p>



<p>However, long-time fans did not share the same enthusiasm as critics did. The aforementioned lack of content and the RPG-like car progression system were highly criticized. While Microsoft never shared player figures, it is widely believed that the game did not meet sales expectations.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Xbox fans might be wondering where this leaves the future of such a core Xbox franchise like Forza Motorsport. Will Microsoft bring in new hires to work on a new project, and if so, how long will it take? These are just two more questions among a veritable sea of doubts and concerns sparked by the latest Xbox cuts.</p>
