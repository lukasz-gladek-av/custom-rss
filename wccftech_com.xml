			<p>It's no secret that Bungie's mammoth shooter, Destiny 2, the game that used to be one of the exemplary models for other publishers on how to build a live service game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/">has been struggling</a>. Players know it, people who follow games but don't play Destiny 2 know it, and of course, Bungie knows it. However, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-dont-want-to-be-a-dead-game-destiny-2s-directors-on-reassessing-the-shooters-future">IGN</a>, game director Tyson Green and core creative director Ben Wommack spoke about how they believe they can build a strong future for the game, starting with Destiny 2: Renegades.</p>



<p>Green was up front with what he believes happened following the conclusion of The Final Shape. While the expansion was, overall, a well-received ending to a decade-long saga, the drop-off in players that followed wasn't exactly part of the plan, and the release of Destiny 2's last expansion, Edge of Fate, didn't help bring players back.</p>



<p>"<em>The Final Shape brought things to a crescendo, where it's like a fantastic ending that tied off a lot of threads,</em>" said Green. "<em>People were pleased and satisfied with what they played, and then the big [downwards] spike in population [came after]. That happened because we ended the saga. So you get what you pay for, right?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>That wasn't the plan from the business perspective. We still want to keep making Destiny; we still have many stories to tell in this universe. There are still lots of things to do, and we have to keep building the game. Unfortunately, it was not gracefully managed, but we had to try something.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Continuing on about the Edge of Fate expansion, Green said, "<em>We looked at the problem we had [after The Final Shape], and we said, 'We think there's a route here,' which is leaning into more systems of pursuit, getting new tiers of gear, armor sets, and power progression, and things like challenge customization. These things that can allow a core audience of players to really say, like, 'I'm really gonna take this game and put it through its paces, and get good rewards for it.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>It sounds great on paper, but it didn't work. I think we've been taught a bunch of hard lessons about what our players want, and there are really two kinds of live games: those that listen to the players and respond, and those that don't. And we don't want to be a dead live game, we want to keep building Destiny. So we're listening to our players, and what our players are telling us is that they don't want to chase a simple number that goes up, they want real rewards</em>."</p>



<p>According to Green and Wommack, the listening and adapting to what their players are asking for begins with Destiny 2's upcoming Star Wars-inspired expansion, Renegades, which is releasing on December 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/">showcased the expansion in more detail earlier this week</a> ahead of its upcoming launch, showing off new elements of the game, including the syndicates, new weapons like the Blasters, and the lightsaber-inspired Praxic Blades. According to Wommack, elements like the Praxic Blade are a sign of Bungie pushing outside its "<em>usual boundaries</em>" for Destiny 2, while Green affirms that Renegades is "<em>still fundamentally a Destiny expansion</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>When you're making something new, you often have a bunch of conventions and boundaries that you have to consider, especially for games that have</em> <em>been around for a long time like Destiny</em>," said Wommack. "<em>It's tempting to stick to those conventions as being the boundaries of the rules, but the truth is that you need to re-examine all of them every single time when trying to really create something special and make a splash. This is especially true when working with Lucasfilm.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We looked at how we made the sandbox stuff we've done, we now have blaster weapons that will stay with us going forward, seeing how the Praxic Blade turned out, and we have the various new syndicates that turned out well. There are things that we definitely wouldn't have done, but we had to accept and push past those usual boundaries to do these things, and as long as it's still fun and people are responding to it, the feel is there,</em> <em>then it's the right decision</em>."</p>



<p>It's good to hear that directors like Green and Wommack feel confident in their thinking with how they are trying to chart Destiny 2's path forward, but how players respond to Renegades when it arrives in a few days will be a turning point for the franchise. Even if it's a massive success, there's still an argument to be made that Bungie would be better off moving on from Destiny 2, to try and move the series forward in a new way.</p>



<p>Perhaps that's why we're seeing rumors appear about <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-in-extremely-early-development-according-to-bungie-leakers/">Bungie working on Destiny 3</a>, because the studio is aware that, after over a decade of Destiny since its release in 2014, and nearly a decade of Destiny 2 being the face of the series, it's time to move on to something new. Renegades being a success along the way would definitely be a nice boost for the company, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/">considering how much the game has been struggling</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">considering all the internal problems</a> Bungie has, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">even with its non-Destiny titles</a>, a fresh start, or at least an attempt at one, feels inevitable.</p>



<p>At least it sounds like Bungie is open to trying for one.</p>

			<p>The most significant announcement made at Tokyo Game Show 2025 was arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>. The massively successful open world racing franchise is returning next year to PC and Xbox consoles, featuring the long-coveted Japan setting.</p>



<p>When is it launching, though? Looking back at previous franchise entries, every Forza Horizon game has been released so far between September and November. However, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1994108555780297089#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to insider Nate the Hate</a>, that trend might change with Forza Horizon 6, because UK developer Playground Games is targeting a launch at some point in the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>The Fall launch window has worked wonders so far for the franchise. The most recent game, Forza Horizon 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached over 40 million players as of July 2024</a> and has since grown further, thanks to its launch on the PlayStation 5 console, where the title even <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outsold Sony's own first-party games for a while</a>.</p>



<p>However, 2026 is definitely a peculiar situation given that the release of the proverbial elephant in the room, Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI, has been postponed from May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Quite literally every triple-A game developer (and most indie ones, too) will want to distance their games as much as possible from that all-consuming void. Sure, Forza Horizon 6 belongs to a different enough genre, but why risk it? Of course, that all hinges on the game being ready to launch by then. </p>



<p>If the game is released in the first half of 2026, it will have been four and a half years since FH5, by far the longest gap between releases in the franchise. Playground Games may actually launch two games next year, given that their other big gamble, Fable, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed from 2025 to a generic 2026 window</a>. Fable might be released toward the end of next year (provided there isn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another delay into 2027</a>).</p>



<p>The developers have yet to reveal many details about Forza Horizon 6, although we already know the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>The map is designed around three key regions: the dense city of Tokyo, coastal areas, and mountain tōge roads. Playground Games is focusing less on raw size and more on density and verticality, especially in Tokyo, utilizing layered, multi-level roads inspired by <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-expansion-launches-on-july-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels expansion</a>.​</li>



<li>Map design emphasizes tight city streets, multi-story highways, mountain passes, and rural rice-field backroads, providing a diverse range of driving experiences within one map that include typically Japanese car races, such as urban street racing, mountain drifting, and high‑speed coastal runs.</li>



<li>The campaign progression harkens back to Forza Horizon 1's structure, where players start with slower cars and earn their way up, with faster tiers unlocking as they progress rather than being showered on them from the get-go.</li>



<li>The car roster in Forza Horizon 6 will be heavily expanded with Japanese flavor, including kei cars and kei vans, which appear both as drivable garage vehicles and AI traffic.</li>



<li>The open world will '<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blow fans away</a>', between the inherent beauty of Japanese environments and the tech improvements made to the engine.</li>
</ul>



<p>While the game has only been announced for PC and Xbox Series S and X, a PlayStation 5 version is inevitable given the success encountered by its predecessor. The only question is whether it will be released later in 2026 or in 2027, but we'll keep you up to date on those rumors and news as soon as they become available.</p>
