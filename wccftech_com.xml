			<p>Japanese developer Monolith Soft is primarily known as the developer of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, but it also contributed to several The Legend of Zelda games, including 2011's Skyward Sword (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an HD remaster on its tenth anniversary</a>) and, more recently, to 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/breath-of-the-wild-greatest-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breath of the Wild</a> and its sequel, 2023's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, both of which were highly acclaimed.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/interview/dev01/collab-talk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an interesting dual interview</a> featuring The Legend of Zelda General Manager Daiki Iwamoto and Monolith Soft Director Yasuhiro Fujita. In the conversation, the duo looked back on this special collaboration between Nintendo EPD and Monolith and, right at the end of the article, Iwamoto expressed the desire for the latter studio to play a 'central role' in 'creating the Zelda series from scratch'.</p>



<p><em>Monolith Soft now has a system in place that allows them to handle everything from coming up with ideas in the early stages of development to incorporating them into the actual game, so we expected them to be more involved in the creative aspects than ever before. [...]</em> <em>I would like Monolith Soft to play a central role as a strong partner in creating the Zelda series from scratch. I hope that the know-how we have cultivated through our work together will further enhance the overall team strength of Monolith Soft, and we will continue to create unique series titles together.</em></p>



<p>Fans took that to mean that Monolith might, in the future, become the lead developer of its own Zelda game, though Iwamoto's statement still refers to the team as a 'strong' partner, but a partner nonetheless. Whether that comes to pass remains to be seen. It may not be long before the studio headquartered in Meguro, Tokyo, unveils its next project. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-3-aionios-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in August 2022</a>, so it's been over three years; sure, there was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of Chronicles X's Definitive Edition</a> in March 2025, but that was mostly a remaster that is unlikely to have taken up a lot of the studio's resources. </p>

			<p>Yesterday's Bloomberg report about the new Divinity game <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first made headlines for the confirmation of the combat system (turn-based)</a> and the ambition to deliver a bigger, better game than even the award-winning Baldur's Gate 3 in less time. Then, following the backlash against Larian's usage of AI for development assistance, Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to issue a clarifying statement</a>.</p>



<p>The studio's founder, owner, and game director also participated in several other interviews just before (or after) The Game Awards 2025 event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's official announcement</a> there, though. In the article <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-you-like-baldurs-gate-3-this-is-gonna-be-great-larian-boss-swen-vincke-reveals-what-to-expect-from-divinity-in-first-interview-since-the-game-awards-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by IGN</a>, Vincke admitted that one of the changes (albeit one that requires a lot of work) compared to previous Divinity titles will be the greatly enhanced worldbuilding.</p>



<p><em>We learned the value of having a solid universe behind you, for sure. One of the first things we started doing was saying, 'Okay, we're gonna put a lot of effort into making this universe feel tidy.' That's also why we are just calling it Divinity, right? There's never been a game that's just Divinity first, because there were all kinds of versions with different names. So this is actually going to be Divinity, which is going to have a proper universe backing it. We're building everything as you would expect, with lots of surprises, so that we can build on top of it. We learned that from BG, because we spent a lot of time delving through all kinds of DnD books, so that's probably one of the biggest takeaways from that development process.</em></p>



<p>[...] <em>We really wanted to tidy up because the first Divinity games were made with little thought for universe-building, and it's only in Original Sin 2 that we started thinking more about it – but even then, not really 100% to what we did with Baldur's Gate 3. So now we're really thinking about it, and so that's a lot of work to make sure we get it right. Because it's the little things, right? I mean, what do people do when they go out to eat? What do they do when they go to sleep? What all of that has to be called out.</em></p>



<p>When I first <span>spoke with my colleague Francesco De Meo about what I'd like to see in the new game after the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/" target="_blank">trademark leak</a>, I immediately told him&nbsp;</span>that Larian would have to significantly step up its game in that specific area. While the setting of Rivellon does have potential, its current incarnation cannot be compared to established fantasy worlds like The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, or Dragon Age, let alone Baldur's Gate 3's Forgotten Realms, which is by far the most popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting and definitely aided BG3's enormous success.</p>



<p>It simply needs a lot more depth, texture, and lore to measure up to such intricately detailed settings. To that end, beyond just fleshing out the world a lot more in preparation for the upcoming game, Larian would do well to look into transmedia opportunities. Divinity: Original Sin got an official board game, but what the setting could really use is a few novels to make fans more attached to specific characters, events, and factions. An animated series could help, too, although that'd be a lot more expensive. As far as in-game features go, it would be nice to have a Codex-like feature that allows players to reference universe-specific terms, events, and people.</p>



<p>Overall, I am pleased that Larian correctly identified the importance of having a strong setting to build their next game upon. Based on what Vincke said, they're trying to finish Divinity quicker than Baldur's Gate 3's six-year timeframe, although that will be a tricky proposition given the size and quality ambition. Still, we'll continue to report on any major development updates. Stay tuned.</p>
