<p>The news was announced with an intense live-action trailer on the studio's official YouTube channel, where the release date first shown on the watch of a downed soldier, and then more prominently displayed on a computer screen as the final shot of the trailer.</p>

<p>Ahead of its launch, players in attendance at any of the following events will be able to check out the 1.0 build for Escape from Tarkov, with the final event in South Korea overlapping with the game's 1.0 launch.</p>

<p>When Escape from Tarkov arrives this coming November, it will have spent a little more than nine years in early access before its 1.0 launch. At the time of this writing, it's not completely clear what changes are coming and what specifically will be included in the 1.0 version, but with the coming build appearing at the above four global events, hopefully, we'll start to hear more about the new version soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Battlestate just recently released a new patch for the game, with <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/351">update 0.16.9.0</a> now live, bringing a slew of balance changes and tweaks. </p>

			<p>Microids has finally announced a release date for Syberia Remastered, a "<em>fully modernized</em>" version of the classic title that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/syberia-remastered-unveiled-for-q4-2025-launch/">first revealed earlier this year</a>. As expected, it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and it'll be out on November 6, 2025. What wasn't expected was that it's also making the jump to VR, and will launch on <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/syberia/6794327920669318/?srsltid=AfmBOoryYxnvWd-oUHWGBdjHWbRYZHo7vAEtjwAE69Dtc_vGvS0-jbac">Meta Quest 3</a> headsets a week after its PC and console launch, on November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>Alongside the news of the confirmed release date and the coming VR version, Microids debuted a 'Before/After' trailer that shows off the visual improvements fans of the original can enjoy in this new remaster. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fans looking to keep a piece of this remaster for themselves will also be able to pick up a physical version of the game on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though it's unfortunately only being released physically in the UK.</p>



<p>The story of Syberia follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York who sets out to remote parts of the French Alps alongside her companion Oscar to find Hans Voralberg, an inventor obsessed with making a discovery thought to be impossible, to find the last remaining living mammoths on a mythical island, Syberia.</p>



<p>The trailer revealed today focuses on the visual improvements, but fans of the original are likely more interested in seeing what Microids has done regarding the redesigned puzzles, and to see how the quality of life improvements coming in the remaster smooth out the entire Syberia experience.</p>



<p>Now, thankfully, those fans have a date to look forward to that will satisfy their curiosity.</p>
