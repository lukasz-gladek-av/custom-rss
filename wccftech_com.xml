			<p>EA has announced that its annual football simulation game series, EA Sports FC, will return on September 26, 2025, with EA Sports FC 26. Alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the cover athlete for the Ultimate Edition of the game, Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala have been revealed as the main cover athletes. EA also showed players their first look at gameplay for this year's entry into the long-running series, with a trailer that claims EA Sports FC 26 includes fixes for several key issues players have with the games. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-reveal-this-week-zlatan-cover-athlete/">EA announced that it would reveal EA Sports FC 26</a>, teasing the return of Ibrahimovic as one of the cover athletes. The process these games usually follow, is that the first trailer features very little, if any gameplay, and is instead a vehicle for introducing the tone of the year's entry, cover athletes, and the release date. We got all of that in today's trailer, and on top of it, we got a good look at some gameplay, and the improvements that EA is touting. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Throughout the trailer, text bubbles appear posing as comments from players criticizing different elements of gameplay, such as the complaint that EA is too slow to show actual gameplay. EA attempts to change the narrative at the top of the trailer, switching from a cutscene to gameplay, and into a sequence where EA shows changes and fixes it has made in EA Sports FC 26 that solve the problems players have with the games.</p>



<p>The message of this year's entry is "<em>Innovation powered by you in every mode</em>," and that the overhauled gameplay experience has been built directly on player feedback. Whether that's actually how it'll feel when players get to test it for themselves remains to be seen.</p>



<p>"<em>FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,</em>" said John Shepherd, vice president and general manager of EA Sports FC in a press release. "<em>We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new tournaments and live events in FUT, all-new archetype customization in clubs, and a career mode that comes alive through evolving challenges. We can't wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary">announced</a> that Charlie Guillemot, son of Ubisoft co-founder and chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, will be a co-chief executive officer alongside Christophe Derennes of Ubisoft's newly formed subsidiary with Tencent. </p>



<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">March</a>, Ubisoft announced that it was forming a new subsidiary that would be partially owned by Tencent, within which Ubisoft would house its biggest IPs and franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Since then, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">leaked information</a> and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">official statement</a> regarding where the subsidiary would be in the hierarchy of Ubisoft's global team and how it would function, we've not had a lot of insight into this new subsidiary. </p>



<p>Now, at least, we have our latest bit of new information, with the subsidiaries' leaders having been named. Christophe Derennes comes to the role after most recently being the head of Ubisoft's North American studios, a role he stepped into in 2023. Before that, he had been the general manager of Ubisoft Montreal since 2020, one of Ubisoft's more famous branches, and one that Derennes co-founded in 1997, where he served the bulk of his time as an executive vice president of production. </p>



<p>Overall, he's been with Ubisoft for 35 years, and says that his focus in this new role is "<em>to finalize the foundations of this new entity, clarifying team responsibilities while ensuring current projects and roadmaps stay on course</em>."</p>



<p>Charlie Guillemot, in a way, has been with Ubisoft his whole life, growing up with it as the family business his dad and uncles had started. He properly joined the company right out of college, and after graduating with a master's degree in computer science, in 2014, he was named the studio head of Owlient. The studio had been acquired by Ubisoft and was set to make mobile games, including Tom Clancy's Elite Squad, which launched in 2020 and was immediately met with controversy at launch due to its intro video including imagery that suggested the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-apologizes-for-tom-clancy-game-imagery-that-sug-1844892904">Black Lives Matter movement was part of a terrorist plot</a>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft apologized, changed the video, and in 2021, <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-guillemot-son-of-ubisoft-s-ceo-is-leaving-the-1846986415">Charlie Guillemot left the company</a>. He faced criticism from employees who saw his appointment to Owlient studio head as nepotism, especially considering that he got the job just out of school. In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">Variety</a> that went live alongside the announcement of Charlie Guillemot and Christophe Derennes as new co-CEOs, Charlie Guillemot addressed the nepotism factor, claiming, "<em>What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, I'm Yves' son,</em>" he began, "<em>That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment</em>.<em> I've spent the last decade building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft, leading teams, managing brands, and navigating change in a fast-moving industry. I also made the conscious choice to step away when it made sense, to learn and grow elsewhere.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead. Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment. What's expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in palce for everyone to do their best work. And beyond that, this industry is where I want to be. There's nowhere quite like it, where creativity, talent, and technology intersect in such dynamic ways, and where you constantly have to adapt to new platforms, new ideas, new expectations from players. That's what draws me in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I'm fully committed to doing everything I can to make this work. Ubisoft matters to me as a company, as a team, and as a place known for taking risks. I know trust is earned, not given. That's exactly how I approach this role</em>."</p>



<p>This is now officially Charlie Guillemot's third role within Ubisoft, since he jumped from Owlient studio head to the lead of Ubisoft's transformation committee, a role he was appointed to<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/charlie-guillemot-returns-to-ubisoft/"> earlier this year</a>. In between 2021 and 2025, he co-founded a Web3 and AI-focused studio, Unagi, which he's still the chief executive officer of, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-guillemot-18609a37/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=fr">LinkedIn page</a>.</p>



<p>As to why Charlie and Christophe were chosen for the co-CEO roles, father to Charlie and boss to Christophe, Yves Guillemot, said, "<em>Christophe brings a deep production expertise and decades of hands-on production leadership in Canada on the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Charlie brings an entrepreneurial perspective, a sharp understanding of evolving industry dynamics and players' expectations, shaped by his experience in game development. He has a strong product mindset, a deep understanding of tech, and a passion for games.</em>" </p>



<p>He also added that they bring "<em>distinct complimentary strengths that will be instrumental in making this new step in the history of Ubisoft a success</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-metal-gear-solid-delta-virtuos-mass-layoffs-rumor/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to French journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">Gauthier Andres on Bluesky</a>, Virtuos, the studio players will recognize as the team working with Konami on <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-not-involved-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, and also recently helped Bethesda release<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, is undergoing mass layoffs, with 300 developers set to lose their jobs. </p>



<p>In a multi-part thread, Andres claims that sources they have spoken to describe internal struggles within Virtuos, as the studio's leadership is seemingly losing the trust of its staff. They point to issues with the team being overworked on getting Oblivion Remastered to the finish line under Virtuos' making an effort of "<em>over-delivering on quality relative to the budget,</em>" seemingly as a way of making the studio stand out in an already crowded industry of support and co-development teams. </p>



<p>Tensions between staff and leaders were compounded by the fact that, per Andres' claims, Virtuos isn't enjoying any royalty payments off the success of Oblivion Remastered, which has risen to be one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">best-selling games of 2025 so far.</a> </p>







<p>Leadership allegedly announced a freeze on raises and a reduction in bonuses this past February, which certainly didn't help the situation, and now, with these layoffs, according to Andres, developers at Virtuos Lyon have gone on strike to protest the cuts, and the impact they'd have to the company's productivity and operating capacity. And, to make matters worse for developer morale, Virtuos leaders have also allegedly begun pushing generative AI tools on employees, who are now allegedly mandated to attend basic training sessions on using AI tools. </p>



<p>According to Andres, 200 of the 300 proposed cuts are happening to a team based in China, while the remaining 100 cuts are impacting developers at its France and US-based studios. Virtuos has yet to make an official statement acknowledging the layoffs at the time of this writing. We'll update this story as more official details are revealed.</p>
