			<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been delayed, developer Skydance Games has announced, with the game now aiming to arrive sometime in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>A couple of months prior to this announcement, Black Panther voice actor Khary Payton <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-the-hydra-could-launch-this-holiday-says-voice-actor/">suggested</a> that the game would be arriving this coming holiday season. Well, clearly, plans changed compared to what Payton was last told, as Skydance says the decision to delay the game was made to give the team more time to "<em>add more polish</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early 2026</em>," developer Skydance Games began in its short statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">X</a>. "<em>Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!</em>"</p>
<p>Published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-to-be-published-by-plaion/">Plaion</a> and developed by a team at Skydance Games led by the legendary Amy Hennig, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has a lot of strong potential. The few trailers <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/">we've seen</a> depict a pretty impressive-looking game and a story that could be one of the better tales we've gotten from anything Marvel in recent years.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see some gameplay by now, though, as we've all been waiting since <a href="https://wccftech.com/captain-america-black-panther-wwii-amy-hennig-confirmed/">2022</a> to see this game come to fruition. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-comes-to-los-angeles-again-from-june-6-9/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> right around the corner, there's always a chance we're not too far off from getting that first gameplay look.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake is unlikely to feature a 60 FPS mode, despite indications found in recent footage.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of their weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at the new game footage that was featured in a recent Creator's Voice video, comparing it to footage captured on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, highlighting the differences between the two versions of the game. Despite a blurrier image, heavier dithering on hair, and shallower depth of field, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game holds up quite well.</p>
<p>What Final Fantasy VII Remake is unlikely to offer on Nintendo Switch 2, as opposed to PlayStation 5, is a 60 FPS mode. In the Creator's Voice video, the iconic scene with Cloud jumping off the train right before beginning the mission to destroy Reactor No.1 runs at 60 FPS, which suggested the Nintendo Switch 2 version would offer a 60 FPS option, but in their analysis, Digital Foundry highlighted how the quality of Cloud's hair in the shot is even higher than in the same sequence on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, so the footage was not taken from the Switch 2 version, but likely from the PC version.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned Creator's Voice video, Final Fantasy VII Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">hinted</a> that the entire remake trilogy could be coming to Nintendo Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, this intention could suggest that the yet-to-be-announced third part of the trilogy may not make the jump to <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-sequel-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> as, while the engine could solve some of the visual issues we have seen in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, we currently have no indication that the engine can run well on the system, or that visuals could be cut down significantly to make the game run on the system and still look reasonably good.&nbsp; With the developer's desire to have part 3 out as soon as possible, which would be difficult to accomplish with an engine change, this statement could have provided an indication of the next game's technical direction.</p>
