			<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC system requirements have been <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_2_remastered_pc_features_new_no_return" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> today, detailing the system requirements for different resolutions and target framerates.</p>
<p>To run the game at low settings, 720p resolution @ 30 frames per second, users won't need a beefy system, as either an Intel Core i3-8100 or AMD Ryzen 3 1300X CPU and either a GTX 1650 or RX 5500XT will be enough. To run the game at the very high graphics preset, 4K resolution @ 60 frames per second, on the other hand, a more powerful system powered by either an Intel Core i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU and either an RTX 4080 or RX 7900 XT GPU, as well as 32 GB RAM. You can find the full system requirements below.</p>
