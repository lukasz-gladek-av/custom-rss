			<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that the first of three story expansions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is out now on all platforms, alongside the game's latest 1.3 update patch, which brings a few quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and a new horse racing feature.</p>
<p>Brushes with Death is the first of three story DLCs that players can jump into if they're looking for more Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and if you bought the Gold Edition of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, or just bought the Expansion Pass separately, then when you update Kingdom Come: Deliverance II on whatever platform you own it on, the Brushes with Death DLC will be a part of that update.</p>
<p>If you just bought the base game, then you'll be able to pick up Brushes with Death individually for $5.99 USD.</p>

<p>The Brushes with Death story sees Henry enlisted to help "<em>a mysterious artist uncover his enigmatic past.</em>" You'll travel across both maps in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's world, speaking to and occasionally fighting several new and some familiar characters throughout a number of quests to help this artist figure out his past.</p>
<p>Just last week, Warhorse Studios announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/">Kingdom Come series had surpassed 13 million copies sold</a>, with the first game breaking 10 million, and its recently released sequel surpassing 3 million copies sold.&nbsp;It's a massive milestone for Warhorse, who can easily be regarded as one of the best makers of open-world games.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,</a> our reviewer, Chris Wray, didn't have enough nice things to say about the game, saying that it is "<em>a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-officially-announces-stellar-blade-pc-release-date-pc-specs-revealed/">Stellar Blade</a> will be out on PC in a little less than a month at this time of writing, and after it was officially announced today, pre-orders went live on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>However, players who were eager to pre-order it were met with <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-blocked-in-130-countries-devs-apparently-werent-aware.1190337/">disappointment</a> and the message that the game was unavailable in their countries. An issue that no one expected, not even the game's developer, Shift Up, <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923052833101709517">who confirmed in a post on X,</a> responding to an upset fan, that the game does not require a PSN account to play it on PC.</p>
<p>And yet, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1294088/info/">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade is marked as unavailable in <strong>130 countries</strong>, just like every other PlayStation-published game on Steam.</p>
<p>Requiring a PSN account to play PlayStation games on Steam is an issue that blew up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-no-longer-purchasable-steam-refunds/">Helldivers 2</a>, and while <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/">Sony did end up relenting in that case</a>, how it handled that whole saga, and every other PC release for PlayStation games, made it clear that PSN account sign-in is something PlayStation and Sony want in all of its PC releases.</p>
<p>Which is what makes this case all the more upsetting, because PlayStation is seemingly punishing players who live in countries where PSN isn't officially available.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there's been no official word from PlayStation on the issue, and based on the few replies the official Stellar Blade X account has given players bringing the issue to them, it seems like Shift Up has been blindsided by this. Hopefully, we'll learn more soon and will update this article as more on this comes to light.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free.1190367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a new Epic Games Store MEGA sale <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live now</a>, featuring discounts for lots of fun PC games. First things first, though: alongside the discounts, Epic is also bringing back the sale's trademark freebies, starting with the psychedelic indie horror game <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/happy-game-35a105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happy Game</a> and with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dead-island-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Island 2</a>, both of which can be added to your libraries for free until Thursday, May 22 at 5 PM.</p>
<p>Dead Island 2 is, of course, the bigger of the two offerings, having sold 4 million units to date. The project started with Yager Development and then moved to Sumo Digital, but it was Deep Silver Dambuster that eventually brought it over the end of the line in a rather successful fashion. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned a 7.5/10 score from Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Games that go through development hell hardly turn out great, but Dambuster Studio proved with Dead Island 2 that this is not always the case, although the game is far from a masterpiece. While the gameplay works and feels quite fun at the start of the game, things become repetitive very quickly due to the linearity of the experience and the shallowness of the combat system. Offering nothing more than some mindless fun, the game would have been more than fine if launched at a lower price, but at full price, Dead Island 2 doesn't offer that much to justify it.</em></p>
<p>If you don't fancy these games, there's plenty of engaging titles that you can grab at discounts in the Epic Games Store 2025 MEGA sale, and you can even take advantage of boosted Epic Rewards (from 5% to 20%) for all purchases made in the store using Epic's payment system until 31 August. Additionally, when using Epic's payment system, you can get 20% back permanently on Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys purchases.</p>
