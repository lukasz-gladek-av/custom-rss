			<p>Five years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of The Outer Worlds, I've finally got my hands on Obsidian's next roleplaying game, Avowed. Microsoft reached out earlier this month with the opportunity of a digital preview event for the press, where we had the opportunity to play a small slice of the game, around two to three hours, starting from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Which, as is often the case with games, begins with a shipwreck. The player character, who can be customized through a fairly in-depth character creation process, is the personal envoy of the Aedyran Emperor, sent to investigate the so-called Dreamscourge plague in the Living Lands, a sizable island located north of the Empire. Players can choose to be either humans or elves (the main races of the Aedyr Empire) and male or female. They're also defined to be Godlike, which means they were touched before birth by one of the gods of Eora, giving them mysterious powers and abilities. Godlike also receive unique facial features that can be customized or even removed, although even if you do remove them completely, the non-player characters will comment on them anyway.</p>
<p>Moreover, players can tweak their attributes from the start, immediately revealing the game's strong RPG roots. Pumping up Might or Intellect isn't just a choice related to combat, either, as you'll often find dialogue options opening up depending on certain attributes. For example, having enough Might could scare away thugs who try to strong-arm you, whereas high Intellect can provide insightful dialogue response options. It's something I have always loved in roleplaying games, and I'm happy to see it appear here.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Avowed_DAWNSHORE_DOCKS_KAI-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of dialogues, they're rather dynamic in that choosing one option might advance the conversation and lock you out of the others, whereas most games allow the player to simply go back and try every option. Facial animations aren't great, though. I don't know if they're final, but they might be, considering there's less than three months before Avowed launches.</p>
<p>Going back to the story, the shipwreck occurs because the ship the envoy is on suddenly gets bombarded by a nearby fort. Only the envoy and the ship's captain make it out alive and have to find out why exactly a fort of Aedyran soldiers would fire on them. Unsurprisingly, the reason is that the soldiers were infected by the Dreamscourge themselves, slowly turning on each other as chronicled in several notes. Eventually, the player finds the soldier's leader still alive but completely mad; he's effectively the first boss fight in Avowed, and the encounter made me hopeful that Obsidian heeded at least some of the criticism on The Outer Worlds.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint with that game was the underwhelming combat and boss fights. Here, though, both seem thoroughly improved. Combat is definitely more satisfying, both due to improved hit feedback and smoother animations, and it's more challenging, too, at least when played on Hard difficulty. It also features a Skyrim-like dual wielding option that lets you freely mix and match most weapon types, each featuring different damage and stun properties as well as different stamina costs.</p>
<p>In the demo, I checked out greatswords, warhammers, greataxes, dagger and shield, sword and shield, mace and shield, wand and shield, sword and grimoire, and wand and grimoire. Each felt its own thing, and some options are undoubtedly better than others depending on the enemy you're facing. I do, however, have a reservation about grimoires. Whereas wands function more like magic versions of bows with quick or charged zaps, their attacks based on stamina like melee weapons and bows, Grimoire abilities are powered by Essence, the game's version of mana.</p>
<p>This puts it at a distinct disadvantage compared to the other weapons because Essence does not appear to recharge itself over time, like in most RPGs. You'll instead have to chug potions, of which there is not an infinite amount. To compensate, the Grimoire spells should be extremely powerful, but that didn't look the case, at least in this build.</p>

<p>I was also happy to find out that, unlike The Outer Worlds where you had to raise your Inspiration stat to manually use your companion's abilities, this is available right away in Avowed. The only companion in the demo is Kai, an aumaua who deserted from the Rauataian navy and sought a new home in the Living Lands. It's too early to tell, of course, but he's already shaping up to be an interesting character, and his tanking abilities make him useful right away in combat. He's not at all afraid to chime in during dialogues, too, and he's voice-acted by Brandon Keener, who played the beloved Garrus in BioWare's Mass Effect series. One-to-one conversations with companions will only happen in camps, which can be set at specific spots. Camps also feature crafting and enchanting stations to upgrade gear.</p>
<p>Following that boss fight, the envoy makes it back to the main island, accessing the area of Dawnshore. This is where I could explore a bit more freely, and the exploration is highly reminiscent of The Outer Worlds. Don't expect this to be a sprawling open world game by any means, though there will be a few secrets to find here and there. By the way, I would recommend playing in first-person view, as the third-person option felt clunky. You can toggle them via the menu, not in real time as in Bethesda games.</p>
<p>Graphically, for an Unreal Engine 5 game, Avowed looks good but not great, even with all the graphics settings pushed to the max and ray tracing turned on. There seems to be something off about the lighting at times, and the art is also a bit of a mixed bag, though it might grow on the player after some time. The performance is already fairly solid, however, and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation have already been implemented.</p>
<p>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on February 18, 2025 for PC (Steam, Xbox app, Battle.net, PC Game Pass), Xbox Series S|X (and Xbox Game Pass), and Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-mods-already-give-unlimited-carry-weight-and-no-weapon-durability-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In my STALKER 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, I mentioned how the game's balance is currently causing frustration for the player:</p>
<p><em>When you're hit in STALKER 2, there's a decent chance you'll not only lose health (which does not regenerate on its own), but you'll also start bleeding. While medkits restore health, you need bandages to stem the bleeding. Similarly, you need to bring food and drinks, anti-rads, and enough ammunition whenever you venture out of the safe zones. You'll want to stock up on all these things because there is no fast travel in this game, and there's no telling when you might need them while roaming the ever-dangerous Zone. However, everything has its own weight; even quest items have weight, and the more you carry, the quicker the stamina drops.</em></p>
<p><em>While that is perfectly understandable within the context of the game's design, I feel that it is absolutely overtuned and ends up being too penalizing. Even when the inventory's weight is in the green range, it only takes a little sprint to deplete the stamina, leading to fairly slow and long treks to travel across the map. I literally wished there was some kind of auto-run functionality, as you're just pushing the forward button for minutes at a time on certain occasions with nothing else to do. A modular approach to difficulty, which is becoming more common in recent game releases, would have been preferable to set the challenge level of combat, travel, injuries and survival separately depending on the player's preferences.</em></p>
<p><em>There's more. The equipment's durability depletes over time, as you'd expect given the realistic theme. Tech NPCs can repair them in the safe zones, provided you've got enough coupons to spare. The problem is that, in some cases, the cost is simply outrageous. I had found an extremely effective armor suit that was worth over 20K coupons. However, when I went to repair it, I was appalled by the NPC requesting 70K coupons - far more than I had available. When repairing something costs over three times its worth, you know something's wrong. I also believe that the side missions could be more rewarding at handing coupons; you don't loot coupons from fallen foes, as they are transmitted digitally to your PDA. You could gather items and then sell them, but there's the little problem mentioned above with taking on too much weight. In short, the economy needs a balance pass, too.</em></p>
<p>Later in the review, I mentioned that either GSC Game World or modders would have to take care of the problem. It looks like the modders already did, albeit in a perhaps excessive fashion. Mere hours after the launch, Nexus Mods user Ronon_Dex_6 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> a mod that provides unlimited carry weight for the player. This works through Cheat Engine, so it's essentially a hack, and it certainly kind of undermines the harsh journey the player is meant to go through. However, it is a temporary solution for those who cannot bear the system as-is, while a better fix can be provided by the developers or by a more elegant mod.</p>
<p>There's also another <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mod</a> that removes weapon durability loss. This is achieved by manually tweaking the durabilitydamagepershot value to 0.0 in the PlayerWeaponSettingsPrototypes.cfg file. Many more mods will undoubtedly be released for STALKER 2. The development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> to release official tools that will allow fans to create cross-platform mods that work on consoles, too. We'll keep you informed of all the most interesting mods as they appear.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-is-not-a-great-fit-for-4k-resolution-in-games-with-low-internal-resolution-like-alan-wake-2.1041582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler still has a long way to go to match NVIDIA DLSS and even AMD FSR 2 in some scenarios, especially in games with low internal resolution like Alan Wake 2, which don't make the upscaler a good fit for 4K resolution in its current state.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared</a> Alan Wake 2 running on PlayStation 5 Pro in Performance Mode using PSSR and on PC using NVIDIA DLSS at the ultra performance setting and the same internal resolution - 864p. Generally, with PSSR, the image doesn't exactly look like 4K resolution as PSSR fails to bring very small detail to the image, unlike DLSS, which does a much better job at the same internal resolution and the same settings. In addition, the image on PS5 Pro looks very soft and unstable, with visible noise and shimmering even with a static image, which makes it even worse than AMD FSR 2 in this particular scenario.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler also leaves something to be desired compared to both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR 2 with effects like SSAO, SSR, and volumetrics, as seen in the fog example where it is clearly shimmering with PSSR. As such, the upscaler in its current state is not only inferior to NVIDIA DLSS, but only manages to trade blows with AMD FSR 2, looking better in motion but not as much in other scenarios. Still, looking at what NVIDIA achieved with DLSS since its release, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution should definitely become much better in the future, as a developer suggested <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">earlier this week.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2: PSSR vs DLSS at Matched 864p Base Resolution" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxPgok_ZRAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Digital Foundry also examined the new Alan Wake 2 ray tracing features created specifically for the PlayStation 5 Pro version, comparing them to the low RT setting in the PC version, which lacks equivalent settings. Unsurprisingly, the console effects are considerably worse than those on PC, so there's still a long way to go to have a proper ray-traced experience on a console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2: PS5 Pro Ray Tracing vs PC RTX 4070/3070/2080 Ti" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lP0NI-rd1Dc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review</a>.</p>
