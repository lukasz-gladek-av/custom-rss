			<p>Over the last year or so, Hello Games has secretly prepared a Nintendo Switch 2 version of No Man's Sky that will be available when <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the console</a> launches tomorrow.</p>
<p>According to the independent British studio, this new version is a massive improvement over the existing Switch version, which, in their own words, pushed that console's hardware to the absolute max of its capabilities. For instance, it was possibly the only game to support AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 on the platform.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the Nintendo Switch 2, No Man's Sky includes its full multiplayer functionality (which the first Switch lacked), including cross-save and cross-play. The density, level of detail, resolution, and frame rate are all significantly higher. Textures are now in higher resolution, and pixel density has been increased in both TV and handheld modes. The UI's resolution has been improved, too, and this version also supports the touchscreen and gyro controls.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgYYQwHuh-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But there's also a new No Man's Sky update out today on all platforms. Titled BEACON, it greatly overhauls settlements and even adds the ability for players to become a town's mayor, taking ownership of multiple settlements. They can construct and upgrade buildings, including new types such as jukebox bars where players can choose the music, merchants where they can build custom starships, and ponds where they can relax and fish.</p>
<p>Each inhabitant can be conversed with. They have their own abilities and attributes, too. As mayor, you will be responsible for welcoming new settlers, resolving disputes and making choices to create prosperity. A well-managed settlement can make its owner rich in resources, but it needs to be protected. Travellers can hire a squadron of wingmen to defend towns when they are attacked by roaming pirates.</p>

<p>This is the 38th named update for No Man's Sky. Following the underwhelming launch in 2016, there's no doubt that Hello Games has more than redeemed itself, as evidenced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very positive user reviews.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update-starts-rolling-out-enabling-network-functions-and-more.1206558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 day one update has started rolling out, enabling network features, playing original Switch games on the system, and more.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-20-1-1-update-out-now-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Everything</a>, the new update enables all network features that were previously not available for those lucky enough to get a unit before the official release, such as using original Switch games, Nintendo Switch Online, GameChat, Virtual Game Cards, uploading screenshots and videos, linking with the Nintendo Switch App to view them, and more. With the network features going live, the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop has also gone live.</p>
<p>The wait has been long, but the next-generation Nintendo system is almost here, and soon enough, players from all over the world will be able to experience its launch titles, which include Mario Kart World and plenty of third-party ports. Among these ports, the most impressive will likely be the Cyberpunk 2077 port, which is also among the first Nintendo Switch 2 games to use<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> NVIDIA DLSS</a> to improve image quality and performance. According to CDPR VP of Technology, the upscaler, alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ram-storage-dlss-push-past-playstation-4/">RAM and the system's storage</a>, are the features that allow the console to surpass the PlayStation 4 system, which was made evident by the fact that the developer was able to release the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Liberty expansion</a>, which ended up skipping last-generation consoles due to technical limitations.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 officially launches tomorrow, June 5th, worldwide, with some exceptions, like China and Central America.</p>

			<p>Only a short time after the third installment's tenth anniversary, yesterday was a great day for The Witcher fans as CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took the stage</a> during the State of Unreal presentation in Orlando, Florida. The footage included a live demo of sorts, but a CD Projekt RED spokesperson <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/witcher-4-tech-demo-shows-the-game-running-at-60-fps-with-ray-tracing-on-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> to VideoGamesChronicle that it should not be confused with The Witcher 4 gameplay.</p>
<p><em>This is a tech demo, and a first look at the cutting-edge technology powering The Witcher 4 – but not The Witcher 4 itself. It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration with Epic Games to push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech, like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer, and FastGeo Streaming, that are helping shape the future of The Witcher.</em></p>
<p>This is perhaps unsurprising, given that the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that The Witcher 4 won't be released before 2027. As such, it's a little too early to see actual gameplay.</p>
<p>The Polish developer had <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its decision to switch from their proprietary RED Engine to Unreal Engine 5 back in 2022. Since the beginning, the claim was that CDPR would help improve the open world game development experience even for other developers. Indeed, what we saw yesterday was impressive, especially considering that the footage was captured on a base PlayStation 5 console that ran the demo at 60 frames per second with ray tracing enabled.</p>
<p>On another note, some fans thought that Ciri looked a bit different in the new video compared to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous trailer that aired during The Game Awards 2024</a>. Again, a CDPR spokesperson addressed this feedback in a quote <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-ciri-trailer-gameplay-ue5-tech-demo-1851783467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided to Kotaku</a>:</p>
<p><em>It’s the same character model used in the 2024 trailer. Ciri’s face is a direct copy of The Witcher 3 model, adapted to work with the latest MetaHuman technology. Two subtle changes were made to improve animation quality: slightly raised eyebrows, and a more relaxed eye area—the latter was present in the trailer but has since been removed.</em></p>
<p>During the State of Unreal presentation, Epic Games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the public availability of Unreal Engine 5.6, which brings several enhancements for developers.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fallout-76/">Fallout 76</a> free update called Gone Fission is now live, introducing a slew of new features marking the beginning of Season 21.</p>
<p>The biggest feature introduced to the game by the Gone Fission update is fishing, which can be done in any water where swimming is possible. 30 new fish can now be caught, and it is also possible to cook new recipes using them. Before you can start enjoying this new pastime in the world of Fallout 76, however, you will first have to complete the Casting Off new questline, where you will receive a working Fishing Rod, which can also be upgraded by completing the new fishing challenges and daily fishing quests.</p>
<p>The Fallout 76: Gone Fission update also introduces 12 Axolotls to find, one available to catch every month throughout the year. The update also introduces Local Legends, new C.A.M.P. items related to the newly introduced fishing challenges, some combat changes, perk tweaks and rebalancing, and more. You can catch the full update notes <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2fsxzAz2icHeeJYGR37kQs/fallout-76-gone-fission-release-notes">here</a> and check out a quick overview of the new content introduced by the latest update in the trailer below.</p>
