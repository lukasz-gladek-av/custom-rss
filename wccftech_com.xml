			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a pretty unique entry in the series in terms of gameplay, as it features a somewhat clear split between the stealth playstyle of classic entries in the series and the more combat-oriented style of recent games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla with its two protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. While both are pretty competent at what they do right from when they are introduced in the story, Yasuke, in particular, doesn't feel that good to play, even in combat. With some choice abilities, however, he becomes much more fun to play, so you should be looking into unlocking these abilities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you're into fighting enemies head-on, there's no better choice of protagonist than Yasuke in Assassin's Creed Shadows, but you will often find yourself surrounded by multiple enemies. To fight multiple enemies effectively, you will want to equip a<strong> Naginata</strong> and learn the <strong>Crescent Strike</strong> ability. This Adrenaline ability is perfect to use when surrounded, as, by swinging the Naginata in a very wide arc, Yasuke knocks enemies down while also pushing them away, giving you some breathing room.</p>
<p>The second Naginata ability to learn as quickly as possible to make fights more fun and prevent things from dragging out too much is <strong>Impale</strong>. This ability can be used not only to reposition Yasuke but also to impale enemies on walls. If the enemy is still alive after the ability has been used, they will be knocked down and open for a grounded attack that is often fatal. Augmenting these abilities is the <strong>Combat Expert</strong> ability on the Long Katana Mastery skill tree, which increases damage with all melee weapons by a certain percentage each level, and the <strong>Increased Armor Damage</strong> on the Teppo Mastery skill tree, which increases armor damage by a certain percentage each level. <strong>Vigor</strong> abilities in the Samurai Mastery tree are also great skills to learn to get additional Adrenaline chunks and use these abilities more often.</p>

<p>If the Naginata is not the melee weapon you want to use in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are some Long Katana and Kanabo abilities you can learn to make them more effective and fun to use as well. The <strong>Sheathed Attack</strong> and the <strong>Sheated Posture</strong> are essential abilities to learn for the samurai's signature weapon, as a charged sheathed heavy attack on a guarding enemy has the chance to knock them down, opening them for a potentially lethal grounded attack. Even if it doesn't knock them down, a sheated posture attack is generally very strong and can kill weaker enemies if they are in a vulnerable state with a single hit.</p>
<p>The powerful Kanabo is also made better and more fun to use by two abilities, <strong>Devastation</strong> and <strong>Forward Momentum</strong>. The first unleashes a second combo ender when using a different type of attack after performing the first finisher, which is often a deadly combination against any sort of enemy. The second makes attacking much faster by pressing the next button in a combo with perfect timing, allowing Yasuke to deliver more devastating attacks more often. These two abilities synergize well with each other as well as with the <strong>Combo Ender Damage, </strong>making the Kanabo one of the strongest weapon types in the game in terms of sheer damage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/inzoi-reveals-pricing-free-creative-studio-demo-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During a recent online global showcase streamed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QkXfP9rwrm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a> and Twitch, inZOI Producer and Director and CEO of inZOI Studio Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim revealed several details about the highly anticipated life simulation game due to launch next week in early access. First and foremost, the pricing was confirmed to be $39.99 with no in-game purchases. This includes all updates and 'DLC' during the early access phase. The developer teased that upcoming content includes freelance jobs, ghost play, a Southeast Asian-inspired cat island called Kucingku, swimming pools and swimming skills, a family tree, new professions, and more.</p>
<p>For those who really cannot wait for March 28, the team has released a free demo called Creative Studio that lets players customize their character and home. However, there is a bit of a trick to getting access to Creative Studio, as you'll need to obtain it as a 'Drop reward' after watching streamed gameplay of inZOI on one of four streaming platforms:</p>
<p><em><b>Twitch &amp; Chzzk</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>First, link your KRAFTON ID with your streaming platform account. You can conveniently link your accounts on the following&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fplayinzoi.com%2Fen%2Fevents%2Fdrops">microsite</a>.</em></li>
<li><em>After adding inZOI to your Steam wishlist and watching a broadcast with the inZOI category for at least 15 minutes, a key will be granted.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>Steam</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you watch inZOI streaming on the&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?snr=1_5_9_">Steam store page</a>&nbsp;for 30 minutes or more,&nbsp;<b>inZOI: Creative Studio</b>&nbsp;will be added to your Steam library.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>SOOP</b></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you accumulate 30 minutes of viewing on a broadcast with the inZOI category set, a key will be granted.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Drops event will run until 22 March at 23:59 UTC and may end early if the supply of codes runs out. However, fear not, as right afterward (from 23rd March 00:00 UTC until 27th March 23:59 UTC), the developers will open up inZOI: Creative Studio to everyone.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the online global showcase, Hyungjun Kim said:</p>
<p><em>I hope that players will be able to experience things that they can’t in real life, feel a sense of control over life itself, and have the opportunity to look at life from a slight distance. It has been a rough ride and there may still be some shortcomings, but we are committed to paying close attention to feedback from our community as we continue to improve the game towards its full release as soon as possible.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires a rather powerful PC</a> if you plan to play it maxed out with the graphics settings. There will be support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution as well as the unique <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'Smart ZOI' NPC feature powered by NVIDIA ACE</a> and a .5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model that runs locally on your NVIDIA GPU when playing inZOI.</p>

			<p>After around a year and a half of near-complete silence, Honor of Kings: World has resurfaced at the Game Developers Conference 2025 with a gorgeous new trailer that shows off the game's vibrant biomes and several boss fights, including some featuring a group of players.</p>
<p>Honor of Kings: World takes place in the setting of the extremely popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. In 2024, Honor of Kings was the top-grossing mobile game with $2.6 billion. Of course, this is a much different game. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-is-an-action-rpg-announced-by-tencent-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2021 as an open world action RPG developed by TiMi Studio Group, developer of Call of Duty: Mobile, Pokémon UNITE, Age of Empires Mobile, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force</a>. It also features a collaboration with acclaimed Chinese writer Liu Cixin, known for The Three-Body Problem. Apparently, he will adapt a story called The Poetry Cloud. In May 2023, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-to-support-dlss-3-ray-tracing-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Honor of Kings: World would support NVIDIA DLSS 3 and ray tracing on PC. It is likely that before its release, it will be updated to the new DLSS 4.</p>

<p>Honor of Kings: World is playable for the first time at the Game Developers Conference 2025, and our envoy Kai Tatsumoto has an appointment to check it out, so stay tuned for our first impressions of the game. For now, it has been announced to be coming for PC and mobile; you can find the newly launched official website <a href="https://honorofkingsworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
