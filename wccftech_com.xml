			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/19/xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the games coming to Xbox Game Pass in the back half of August, with BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the remastered Gears of War: Reloaded, Persona 4 Golden, and more, headlining the rest of the month's entries.</p>



<p>The top of the month was headlined by titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-adds-assassins-creed-mirage-rain-world/">Assassin's Creed Mirage and Citizen Sleeper 2</a>, and the seven titles confirmed today, along with previously announced games like the shadow-drop of <a href="https://wccftech.com/heretic-hexen-remaster-nightdive-studios-id-software-quakecon-2025/">Heretic + Hexen</a>, round out the month as a strong showing of Game Pass additions for August 2025.</p>



<p>Other notable entries for this month are the rougelite FPS Void/Breaker, Goat Simulator Remastered, and Herdling.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the rest of August 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blacksmith Master (Game Preview) - available Aug. 19 on PC</li>



<li>Void/Breaker - available Aug. 19 on PC</li>



<li>Goat Simulator Remastered - available Aug. 20 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Cloud</li>



<li>Persona 4 Golden - available Aug. 20 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Cloud</li>



<li>Herdling - available Aug. 21 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Cloud</li>



<li>Gears of War: Reloaded - available Aug. 26 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Cloud</li>



<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - available Aug. 28 on PC, Xbox Series X/S, Cloud</li>
</ul>



<p>And as is always the case, with games coming into Xbox Game Pass, there are games leaving. At the end of this month on August 31, five games will be exiting the subscription service and will no longer be playable through a Game Pass subscription on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-vp-hints-at-more-affordable-xbox-cloud-gaming/">Xbox's Cloud Gaming service</a>, Xbox consoles, and PC. Here are the five games leaving on August 31:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ben 10 Power Trip</li>



<li>Borderlands 3</li>



<li>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay</li>



<li>Sea of Stars</li>



<li>This War of Mine: Final Cut</li>
</ul>



<p>Even with those departures, there's still plenty of great games to spend your time with through Game Pass, and there's potentially even more to come, as we're still waiting to see what Xbox has to announce during <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/gamescom-onl-2025-where-when-to-watch/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a> and the rest of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Gamescom 2025 week.</a></p>
