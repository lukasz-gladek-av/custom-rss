			<p>Cloudheim is a brand-new multiplayer action RPG from the independent studio Noodle Cat Games. This game comes from a studio comprised of veteran developers from Epic Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">EA</a>, Codemasters, Disney, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-leaving/">Bioware</a>. To celebrate the reveal of Cloudheim, the developers have released a gameplay trailer that you can see down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cloudheim - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHnpo84ybmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This debut title will be set to launch in Q3 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. You'll be in for a fun and chaotic time, as there is physics-based combat, as well as plenty of exploration, looting, and base creation in a Norse-inspired world.</p>
<p>"Cloudheim blends the exceptional talent of a veteran team with an experimental, iterative development process informed by science and modern psychology. Every member of the team has a meaningful creative impact, allowing us to push exceptional gameplay quality for our team size, budget, and development time. I'm proud of what we've built, and how the team has proven this process is ultimately better for the ones who matter most - our players," said David Hunt, CEO and Founder of Noodle Cat games.</p>
<p>Cloudheim is set to stand out from the crowd, with a ton of chaos to unleash on the world, as it's a fully breakable world where players can chain together their abilities with other teammates to defeat enemies. Whether this means pulling down pillars to crush enemies, lassoing enemies into tornadoes, or shooting monsters out of cannons, there's plenty of chaos to be had around every corner.</p>
<p>You are given the option to play solo, or you can join forces with up to three of your friends in online co-op, where you will share every weapon and ability unlocked and can work together to explore, uncover secrets, and discover new playable characters as a team.</p>
<p>"Our core gameplay began with a simple question - what if we take the juggling from fighting games and make it the combat foundation in a co-op action RPG?" said David Hunt. "Mix in a hauntingly beautiful world, a chaotic symphony of physics combos, and base customization - that's Cloudheim."</p>
<p>While you will be defeating monstrous foes and goblins, there will also be opportunities to team up with creatures such as a Swordcupine, Blins, and a Gnasher to help you through tough conquests when you need them.</p>
<p>As stated above, this title is set to release later this year. If you want to be kept up to date on this title, the Cloudheim <a href="https://cloudheimgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> will provide all the info you could need on this upcoming ARPG.</p>

			<p>Today, Polish developer The Farm 51 announced the early access release date of their upcoming title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-open-world-sequel-announced-for-2025-pc-requirements-already-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</a>. The game, which is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thefarm51/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-an-open-world-sci-fi-rpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Kickstarter to gather funds</a>, will be available on Steam starting on March 6. They also shared a CGI story trailer where we can first glimpse the game's narrative.</p>
<p>Cole Grey, a former military and security guard, lives in a reality where the economy and industry are entirely based on a substance called Chernobylite. With its help, humans have made a real leap forward in civilization. However, the construction of this utopia has been paid for by massive unemployment, pushing people like Cole to the margins of society.</p>
<p>Faced with severe financial problems, he joins the mysterious 'Planewalker' initiative to provide for his family. It soon becomes apparent that there is a shortage of Chernobylite in Cole's universe, and the solution is the morally questionable initiative, which involves traveling to parallel worlds in search of the mineral and obtaining it by any means necessary.</p>
<p>The Planewalker service also requires genetic modifications. Cole must, therefore, physically absorb the essence of the Chernobylite and lose part of his humanity to enhance his physical and intellectual abilities. Seeing no other option for himself, he agrees to the bloody and dangerous service, which results in him being trapped in the most sinister place in the world: the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. There, he meets a Black Stalker, the Zone's dark leader and silent ruler. Cole's ultimate goal is, of course, to escape the sinister Exclusion Zone and return home.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is going well so far. With a week left, the game has already surpassed the minimum funding goal while unlocking a few stretch goals, such as the optional first-person combat mode, the return of all guns from the first Chernobylite, weapon customizations, and new locations for both solo play and cooperative missions, one of the sequel's new features. The next stretch goals would unlock a customizable interface for both first-person and third-person views, and a customizable dialogue camera.</p>
<p>The system requirements are also available on the Steam page, so we've embedded them below for those interested.
