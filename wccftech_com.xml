			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB's rating of Silent Hill 2 on Xbox</a>, KONAMI has announced today that the remake of the classic survival horror game is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/SILENT-HILL-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now available on Xbox Series S and X and on the Xbox PC Store</a>. The game actually supports Xbox Play Anywhere, so you'll get it on both platforms with a single purchase.</p>



<p>The Japanese publisher has also attached a promotion to the launch: the game's Standard and Deluxe Edition are currently 50% off on the new platform, and the same applies on PlayStation 5. The Steam version doesn't have any discount for the time being, but KONAMI might just be waiting for the platform's Black Friday sale to trigger it.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 Standard Edition is thus priced at $34.99 on the Xbox ecosystem, while the Deluxe Edition costs $39.99. There is also a dual pack with Silent Hill f, which launched a couple of months ago. The Standard Edition of this dual pack is priced at $79.99, while the Deluxe Edition will set you back $95.99. Silent Hill f is also separately discounted by 20% as part of KONAMI's Black Friday sale.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake was released in October 2024 to widespread acclaim. Bloober Team's work <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a 9 out of 10 here on Wccftech</a> by reviewer Chris Wray:</p>



<p><em>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</em></p>



<p>To date, the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has sold more than 2.5 million units</a>, making it likely this Xbox release will push it toward 3 million copies sold in the near future. Following this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful release of Silent Hill f</a>, the franchise's next installment is the spin-off Townfall, which a retailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently listed for a March 2026 debut</a>.</p>
