            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just yesterday, at the time of this writing, before the Gamescom ONL 2025 craze started, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/">BioShock 4 developer Cloud Chamber was suffering layoffs</a> and letting go of an unspecified number of staff. At the same time, we learned that former Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, would be taking over as the new studio head. </p>



<p>Today, Take-Two confirmed the cuts, but it was Schreier who added that the cuts would affect 80 members of Cloud Chamber's 250-person team. What's more, this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTcxNDU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzE5MzQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUIxVEZHUFFRN1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zVepbosqQPRpkHaMvUcaBAlKk73_0IkMGOvNKaKU6mE">new report from Schreier</a> also reveals that BioShock 4 might not arrive until mid-to-late 2027.</p>



<p>An internal email from 2K president David Ismailer was shared with Bloomberg, in which Ismailer commented on the decision-making process behind the layoffs, but stopped short of directly saying how many people were impacted. </p>



<p>Ismailer wrote, "<em>While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a </em><em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development."</p>



<p>"<em>I know this is tough news for everyone. If your role is being affected, you'll hear from your manager or studio leadership today with details on severance, career services and support resources. There is no easy way to do this, but we hope to do whatever we can to support you through this. I want to thank each of you for your dedication and hard work."</em></p>



<p>According to the sources Schreier spoke to, BioShock 4 had an internal release target of "<em>late 2026 or early 2027</em>," but thanks to this restructuring, that timeline has been pushed back further, and now the game might not arrive until sometime in mid-to-late 2027, if it arrives in 2027 at all. And even if it does make a 2027 release window, that'll still mean the game was in development for over a decade.</p>



<p>Schreier's report goes on to discuss a number of the issues Cloud Chamber has faced in that time, including a challenge that we've seen other studios fail to overcome, which is attempting to build a big-budget, triple-A game while also building up a new studio at the same time.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate, to say the least, to see what has become of a game that, more than a decade ago, players were extremely excited to play. It's worth wondering whether BioShock 4 will have the same impact in 2027 that it would have had in, say, 2016, which would have been three years after BioShock Infinite's launch. </p>



<p>At this point, Take-Two has far too much invested to stop now, or at least it definitely feels like we're past the point where the game could just be killed without ever launching. Hopefully, Fergusson and the remaining team can pull something together. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Unveils DirectX Advanced Shader Delivery to Combat Shader Stuttering]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-directx-advanced-shader-delivery-combat-shader-stuttering/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-unveils-directx-advanced-shader-delivery-to-combat-shader-stuttering.1276425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft's DirectX team <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/introducing-advanced-shader-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> a new feature called Advanced Shader Delivery. This feature will make its debut on the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds (now officially inbound <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/">on October 16</a> for $549.99 and $899.99, respectively), but it will eventually roll out to regular PCs. A dedicated AgilitySDK will be released to game developers next month, allowing them to integrate the functionality in their upcoming and even existing games.</p>



<p>The purpose of Advanced Shader Delivery, which was co-developed with Xbox and AMD, is to address one of the banes of PC gamers: shader stuttering. The DirectX team said:</p>



<p><em>We have partnered with teams across Xbox and at AMD to precompile this data and distribute it at download time for key titles via the Xbox PC app This approach not only gets you into your games faster, but it also prevents most instances of stutter that cause performance issues.</em> <em>As an example, in Obsidian Entertainment’s Avowed, our engineering teams observed launch times reduced by as much as 85%. This not only means you’re playing your game faster, but your battery life is spent on playtime, not compiling.</em></p>



<p>The process involves a new method of collecting shader data from any game and packaging it in a new, standardized format called a State Object Database (SODB). The DirectX engineers successfully separated the shader compiler from the graphics driver and united the game data in the SODB with the compiler in the cloud to create a Precompiled Shader Database (PSDB). The PSDB can then be distributed by the Xbox Store alongside the game, supplementing the shader cache. When a game runs for the first time, it sees that all the necessary shaders are already available in a Windows cache and can therefore skip the compilation step on the gaming device. If a device receives a driver update, the app will detect this and automatically update the shader cache.</p>





<figure></figure>



<p>The caveat is that in the beginning, this will only work on titles distributed via the Xbox app, not Steam (or the Epic Games Store, GOG, Ubisoft Connect, etc.). However, other storefronts may eventually integrate the feature via the upcoming AgilitySDK.</p>



<p>It'll be intriguing to see whether Advanced Shader Delivery can truly help with solving the issue of shader stuttering in PC games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wolcen Studio has finally revealed the real title of its PvPvE extraction game, which, up until now, we've only known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolcen-studios-project-pantheon-will-host-its-second-closed-alpha-test-later-this-month/">Project Pantheon</a>. It's officially called Gods, Death, and Reapers, and we just got a new gameplay trailer showcased during the Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>The isometric RPG is still fairly early in development, as there was no release date or even release window announced alongside the official title reveal, but it is available for you to try if you're interested. Just head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Gods_Death__Reapers/">Steam page</a> and request access for the closed playtest to jump in now.</p>

<p>"<em>Gamescom 2025 marks a huge milestone for us as we finally get to share&nbsp;</em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reaper</em>'s official name and gameplay with the world," said game director Andrei Chirculete in a press release. "<em></em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>&nbsp;is a game that started from one simple idea: what if you could play an extraction game that looks like a top-down ARPG? Now that this idea has turned into&nbsp;<em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>, we can't wait to hear from our players what they think, as it will help us shape up the best version throughout the coming Closed Alpha tests!"</p>



<p>To learn more about Project Pantheon, now Gods, Death, &amp; Reapers, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">check out our interview with Wolcen Studio from earlier this year</a>, after a conversation with the team at Gamescom 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher Xbox Game Studios and developers Team Ninja/PlatinumGames have unveiled the official PC system requirements for Ninja Gaiden 4 on the game's store pages. From the looks of it, the game will be very easy to run, considering that the GPU listed in the minimum requirements is the GTX 1060 which launched nine years ago. Granted, this will be at 1080p resolution, 30 frames per second, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution set to Quality, and everything set to Low. To play at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second with Medium settings, you will need an RTX 2060 SUPER.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>OS: Windows® 10/11, 64bit<br>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3400G<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or ​ AMD Radeon™ RX 590(VRAM 8GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 100 GB available space<br>Sound Card: 16bit 48kHz ステレオ<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. ​ 1080p / 30FPS​ FSR quality "Low"​ Object Quality "Low"</p>



<p><br><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>OS: Windows® 10/11, 64bit<br>Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2060 Super(VRAM 8GB) or AMD Radeon™ RX 5700XT(VRAM 8GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 100 GB available space<br>Sound Card: 16bit 48kHz ステレオ<br>Additional Notes: SSD Required. ​ 1080p / 60FPS ​ FSR Quality "Middle"​ Object Quality "Middle"</p>



<p>Unlike <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, which was remade with Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Gaiden 4 is believed to run on PlatinumGames' proprietary engine. This engine prioritizes performance over visuals, especially for this type of action games that require low latency (and, therefore, high frame rates) to execute pitch-perfect moves.  </p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for the first time at Gamescom 2025</a>. Our Francesco De Meo checked it out earlier today, so stay tuned for his hands-on impressions. Hint: as a long-time fan, he was favorably impressed.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
