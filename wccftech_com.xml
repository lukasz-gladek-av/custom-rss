			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/">Digital Extremes</a> and Valve are currently giving away free copies of Dark Sector, the third-person title made by the Warframe devs. From today until November 30, PC games will be able to obtain this game for free by visiting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam store page</a> for Dark Sector. This game is a third-person action shooter that was first released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2008 and then was ported to Steam in 2009. If you've been wanting to try this game out but weren't sure whether you want to spend money on it, this is a great time to get hold of it and add it to your backlog.</p>
<p>Dark Sector is a game that does have mixed reviews, mainly based on the visual design of the game. This game has been compared to Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War by critics. Themes that were seen in Dark Sector were also seen in Warframe. For example, the name Tenno is seen very frequently throughout Warframe, as that is the name of the faction that is controlled by players.</p>
<p>In this game, you play Hayden Tenno (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum), a man who works at the CIA. In this game, you witness Hayden go through a transformation, as he has been infected with the Technocyte Virus on his right arm, which then begins to take over his entire body. As a result of the Technocyte Virus, you see his psyche begin to deteriorate. However, he begins to gain superhuman powers, including the ability to grow a bladed glaive on his arm. With this glaive, he can throw it at his enemies with precision. As you progress through the game, you see Hayden begin to transform further, and his powers evolve, making him a deadly force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>Dark Sector's main focus is a single-player campaign, but the game also features a multiplayer game mode. At the moment, it's uncertain whether the multiplayer game mode is still active, but due to the game being free on Steam for now, it's possible that the multiplayer game mode will still be active and available to play.</p>
<p>The Steam Autumn Sale is also on right now, which will provide many discounts for any games that may be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Dark Sector?</p>

			<p>One of the most controversial games in the Fallout franchise has officially reached over 21 million players and has now taken to social media to ask fans to consider nominating Fallout 76 for Steam's Labor of Love Award. Fallout 76 first launched in 2018, and had a bit of a rough start at launch. The game was pretty bug-ridden (much like many Bethesda games), but it is now in a much better place. Similar to how No Man's Sky started, the developers have been putting a ton of work into the game to make it more playable and add more content. This includes significant updates such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/">Milepost Zero</a>, which added Legendary crafting and new delivery quests for players to participate in.</p>
<p>In the blog post released by the Fallout 76 team, they stated that the game has had more than 50 free updates, and the community has continued to expand. They've stated that over 21 million Vault-dwellers have made it to Appalachia. Players have many opportunities to provide their feedback to the team at Bethesda Game Studios via Reddit, X, Discord, and more. Additionally, there is a Player Test Server where those who opt in can provide actionable feedback for the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate this news, they are now working on making more tweaks to the game systems and player loadouts, which were introduced in the Locked &amp; Loaded update. Additionally, on December 3, a new update will be released for Fallout 76. This update is called Gleaming Depths, which introduces a brand-new raid to the game, as well as C.A.M.P. pets, Four-Star Legendaries, Player Titles, and other quality-of-life improvements to the game. The team has been posting some glimpses of the Gleaming Depths update, where they've shown some of the pets that you'll be able to have at your C.A.M.P.</p>
<p>In the blog post, they go on to finish their statement by saying:</p>
<p>"Throughout these six years, the community has always been at the forefront of our mind when implementing changes and introducing new content. We cannot thank you enough for your contributions and support! We look forward to how the Fallout 76 community will contribute to the game in the years to come."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5ATk04i7pbwOlbZqni7MNM/nominate-fallout-76-for-the-steam-awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their post</a> was used to announce the number of players that are flocking to the game, as well as the new update they will be releasing, most importantly, they asked for a nomination for the Labor of Love Steam Award. The Steam Awards nominations have already opened, and you can vote for your favorites across a number of categories.</p>
