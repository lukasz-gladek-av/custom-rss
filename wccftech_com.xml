			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/01/xbox-game-pass-july-2025-wave-1/">announced</a> the monthly Game Pass additions for July 2025, and there's little doubt that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 will be the highlight.</p>



<p>The long-awaited remake of the skateboarding series' third and fourth mainline installments will launch on July 11. On that same day, the games will become available to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers on Xbox consoles, PC, and cloud. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/sgf-2025-tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previewed</a> Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 at Summer Game Fest 2025; here's an excerpt from his hands-on:</p>



<p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4’s biggest change in the hands-on preview, beyond the obvious exclusion of the free-form career mode from THPS4, is backporting all the gameplay and mechanical changes from the fourth numbered entry back into THPS3. This means grind extensions, leveling out, and even skitching are all on the menu for Foundry and Airport. It consolidates the two numbered entries into a single launcher and menu, combining both games into a $49.99 package. Activision tipped us off about some of the other brand-new features coming to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, including new modes like Photo Mode and HAWK, but also the ability to create custom goals in Create-a-Park. However, I wasn’t able to check all of these out, given our limited time to get hands-on.</em></p>



<p>Starting today, Game Pass subscribers at all tiers can play Little Nightmares II (the new installment is coming out soon) and Rise of the Tomb Raider. Starting tomorrow, Square Enix's Legend of Mana and Trials of Mana will be available to Game Pass Standard subscribers on Xbox consoles. On July 3, the party platformer game Ultimate Chicken Horse will be added to all GP tiers and supported platforms, while the co-op action shooter RPG The Ascent will be added on July 8. The following day, the indie casual management sim will be available on all platforms to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Last but not least, the first-person shooter High on Life returns to Microsoft's subscription service on July 15 and will be available to all tiers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 576.88) to support the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-officially-unveils-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-graphics-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RTX 5050</a> graphics cards. This driver is also optimized for the launch of Mecha BREAK, the multiplayer mech-themed third-person hero shooter game that's out today on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The game features 3v3, 6v6, and even PvPvE modes like Mashmak, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mecha-break-open-beta-mashmak-pc-hands-on-preview-extracted-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previewed</a> by Kai Tatsumoto at a recent press hands-on event:</p>



<p><em>The real star of the show that Amazing Seasun Games invited us out to play was their new extraction mode, Mashmak. This loot-and-scoot PvPvE mode is all about airdropping onto a massive 16x16 km map, scouting for resources, taking out rival squads and NPC bosses, and making it out alive with whatever you can carry with you. Despite having a large map, the actual gameplay is limited to up to ten squads of three players, with empty spots filled by NPCs. To force players to keep moving and not camp out in one remote corner of the map, extraction points slowly start to appear at the ten-minute mark with more dropping every five minutes; once one has been used, it’s gone for good for the rest of that match. Not only do players have to contend with enemy players potentially camping these extraction points out, but there’s a constantly shrinking field of engagement as Corite Pulse Storms slowly engulf the battlefield. This field can disable weapon lock-ons and also inflict a constant drain on both mech health and fluid armor.</em></p>



<p>Mecha BREAK releases today with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Using DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode, GeForce RTX 50 Series players can see their frame rate boosted by an average of 4.6x while running the game at 4K resolution with max settings.</p>



<p>On the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, Mecha BREAK runs at an average of 456 FPS, and even the much more affordable GeForce RTX 5070 surpasses 200 frames per second.</p>

<p>Today also marks the debut of Diablo IV: Seasons of Horadrim, the ninth season of the game's live service. The update brings many new features and content and also adds NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to the game's settings, whereas GeForce RTX 50 Series owners previously had to enable that through the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Recently, The Chinese Room's first-person horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> received the premium Siren's Rest expansion. The free update that launched last week also added NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution can be upgraded to the most recent transformer model with the NVIDIA app override.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lastly, it was confirmed that NTE (<a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-anime-gta/">Neverness to Everness</a>), the online action RPG in development at Hotta Studio, will support DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation already in the upcoming Closed Beta slated to begin this Thursday and scheduled to end on July 16. When the game was first announced in July 2024, the Unreal Engine 5 powered open world game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> to support both NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing. The latter isn't mentioned in the new brief, but it could still be added at a later time.</p>
