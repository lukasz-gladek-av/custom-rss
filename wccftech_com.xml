			<p>After it was first announced in April 2024, and after a public demo and beta tests, developer Loric Games has given its open-world airship-building survival game, Echoes of Elysium, an early access release date. It'll arrive on PC on Steam on December 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Loric Games confirmed the news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2644050/view/563639088757867952?l=english">in a post on the game's Steam page</a>, which also included a new trailer featuring some cinematic looks at gameplay.</p>



<p>"<em>Echoes of Elysium has been a dream project for us</em>," said Loric Games co-founder, Ray Soto. "<em>We wanted to build a world that feels alive, one where you can build, explore, and truly feel free in the skies. That moment when your ship lifts off for the first time...it's pure</em> <em>magic</em>."</p>

<p>Early this year, ahead of Echoes of Elysium participating in one of this year's Steam Next Fest events, I got the chance <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-hands-on-preview-the-skys-the-limit/">to preview Echoes of Elysium and check out the demo ahead of its public release</a>, and hear a presentation from the developers. I spent a fair bit of time with the game then, and while its sky-high setting felt like both a pro and a con, I went away looking forward to seeing the game evolve further. At the time, I wrote, "<em>If you like MMO survival crafting games and a bit of ship building, then it's worth your time to check out the demo when it's available, but for now, the sky being the only limit to Echoes of Elysium is both a bit of a blessing and a curse. Hopefully, one day it's just a blessing.</em>"</p>



<p>I wouldn't be surprised to jump in at early access and see it still struggling with some of the issues I highlighted in my preview, but the benefit of its early access state is that we know it'll evolve and improve over time. As I said before, if you're already into open-world survival games like this, Echoes of Elysium at least looks like one to keep an eye on.</p>

			<p>A PlayStation 5 cross-buy feature, which would allow users to purchase a game from the PlayStation Store and receive a free copy of the same game for other formats, may be on the way, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst/status/1985788815030861860">yesterday's report from Amethxst</a>, who discovered new icons recently added to the PlayStation Store which suggest that a cross-buyfeature could be on the way, known leaker billbil-kun posted a new report on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-cross-buy-ps5-pc-en-preparation-chez-playstation-voici-les-resultats-de-notre-enquete-60757">Dealabs</a>, confirming that these new icons can be indeed found on the PlayStation Network, and can be seen by inserting special characters into the "About" section of a PlayStation Network account.</p>



<p>Although the addition of these symbols is recent, the development of a PlayStation 5 cross-buy feature appears to predate their introduction. In some of the site's CSS files, billbil-kun discovered the "crossbuy-tag" tag in certain file properties, and this tag has been confirmed to have been added to the PlayStation website back in June 2025. As this isn't data from the PlayStation Vita days where some titles were released as cross-buy games for the handheld and home consoles, it definitely seems like something is indeed in the works.</p>



<p>While the presence of a PS5/PC icon seems to suggest that this cross-buy feature will allow users to get the game on either platform and receive the other version of the game for free, there's the chance that this feature could also involve the rumored PlayStation handheld, which is said will launch alongisde the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>Even if this weren't the case, PlayStation 5 and PC cross-buy would still be very interesting to see, not only for achieving parity with <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-xbox-play-anywhere-doing-well-adoption-big-third-party-publishers-will-come/">what Xbox has been offering for years</a>, but also to explore how this would work on handheld devices. Is a PlayStation PC storefront on the horizon as well? Hard to say at this time, but the possibility is definitely there.</p>

			<p>As we near the one-month mark of Battlefield 6 being on shelves, there's no denying that it has had a strong commercial launch. It sold more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">7 million copies in its first three days</a>, and as of the time of this writing, the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/#max">concurrent player count on Steam has not dipped below 200K</a>. That doesn't mean it's been entirely without its issues, of course. Thankfully, EA and Battlefield Studios seem to be listening, since one of the game's biggest issues is getting a "<em>major overhaul</em>" based on player feedback.</p>



<p>That issue is, of course, the pacing of the game's progression regarding its challenges and assignments, which, when completed, move you through the battle pass, unlock weapon attachments, and in many cases, new weapons, since several weapons in your arsenal in Battlefield 6 cannot be unlocked purely through levelling up.</p>



<p>"<em>As we continue to build on the improvements we mentioned previously, we are also delivering a major overhaul of Challenges and Assignments, guided by gameplay data and your feedback</em>,<em>"</em> Battlefield Studios <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229">writes in its announcement</a>. "<em>This update makes significant reductions to challenge requirements, cutting down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression that rewards consistent play. Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You might recall that it was clear Battlefield 6 had an issue with its progression <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">once players started to farm XP in bot-filled PvE Portal matches in droves,</a> more than what is usual in the case of Battlefield, since that ends up happening in some form for each game. EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">did its best to shut that down,</a> but thankfully, it has gone beyond that to actually trying to address the root of the problem, which is that getting anything in Battlefield 6 is too much of a grind.</p>



<p>Today's update adds over 90 adjustments to challenges and assignments, with some of the key ones being that weapon assignments for all weapon types have been simplified, and damage requirements have been reduced from 10,000 to 3,000. Mode-specific assignments have been standardized across the board; they now only require two wins per tier instead of five. Multi-kill and kill streak goals have been reduced from twenty multi-kills down to five, and challenges for each of the different classes can also be completed much faster.</p>



<p>It's good to know that EA and Battlefield Studios are paying attention to complaints players have raised about progression, and hopefully, within another month's time, we'll see the state of progression in the game in an even better spot than it is now.</p>
