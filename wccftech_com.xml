			<p>Activision and Treyarch have <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Multiplayer-Content">revealed the Season 1 roadmap</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which includes a slew of new content for players to dig into as the game gets going and tries to find its footing. It's "<em>the biggest Season 1 ever</em>," according to Activision, with multiple new weapons, several new maps for multiplayer and zombie game modes, and more.</p>



<p>While the focus is obviously on the new additions to the multiplayer and the zombies mode, there's also new content for its PvE Endgame mode, if you're still looking for something to do <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">after completing the game's campaign</a>. There are four new Endgame events, eight new Exotic Skills to earn, and a new holiday-themed event coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>Regarding the additions to multiplayer, three brand new maps are available right at the start of Season 1: Fate, Utopia, and Odysseus, and a fourth remastered version of Standoff to kick off the season. Mid-season, the new Yakei map joins the lineup along with the remastered Meltdown. Lastly, Fringe joins the map lineup before the end of the season.</p>



<p>Activision and Treyarch also released a new trailer showcasing what's coming in the season, which you can check out below.</p>

<p>There are also new game modes getting added in this season, including favourites like Prop Hunt and Gun Game. One in the Chamber, Sharpshooter, and Sticks &amp; Stones are also joining in Season 1, with a holiday-themed limited-time Takeover mode getting introduced towards the end of the year. There's also seven new weapons joining the fray for players to grind.</p>



<p>Zombies players can look forward to a new Astra Malorum map and the continuation of the storyline, a new survival map called Exit 115, new traps, and a bevy of returning upgrades and loot from previous Zombies modes. </p>

<p>Black Ops 7 has been out for a little more than a week at the time of this writing, and while it was able to chart towards the top-end of reported sales charts so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">it's still majorly behind the year's other major shooter, Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it's too early to really count Call of Duty out, and we could still end 2025 with it being the best-selling game of the year if it's able to pick up the pace. We'll see where things land in January when we have the final full-year results for 2025. </p>
