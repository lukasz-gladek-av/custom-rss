			<p>NVIDIA has announced that Monster Hunter Wilds is now available to play via the GeForce NOW cloud. CAPCOM's new game recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> sales records (over eight million units in just three days), and now it'll open up to a new audience, allowing even those without a powerful PC or console to join the hunt via the GeForce NOW app on any PC, Shield TV devices, Mac, and compatible TVs and smartphones.</p>
<p>It's a big week overall for GeForce NOW users, who also get support for the free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game FragPunk and Hazelight's latest title, Split Fiction. The latter game earned an 8 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Birch's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios‚Äô last couple of games, but it‚Äôs hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two‚Äôs unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone‚Äôs favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you‚Äôre not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, NVIDIA's cloud platform also supports the newly launched action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished. The game developed by Eko Software is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863430/Dragonkin_The_Banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out now in early access</a> and you can read Francesco De Meo's thoughts <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</em></p>
<p>The weekly GeForce NOW roundup also includes the following previously released games which, however, are now supported on other stores:</p>
<p>‚óè Ghostrunner 2 (Epic Games Store)<br>
‚óè Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (Epic Games Store)<br>
‚óè Prey (Epic Games Store, Steam, and Xbox available on PC Game Pass)</p>

			<p>Sometimes, it's really hard to let some things go, even for a legendary game creator such as Hideki Kamiya, who seems to have some trouble forgetting the <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/">canceled Xbox exclusive Scalebound.</a></p>
<p>In a new studio update video from Clovers, Kamiya-san's new development studio, which is currently working on an Okami sequel in collaboration with CAPCOM, the creator of the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta series, among other excellent action games, was shown reminiscing about Scalebound while looking at footage and trailers shared online back when the game was still in active development. Despite the project having been canceled eight years ago, it still holds an important place in Kamiya-san's heart, as he would love to make it again someday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Let‚Äôs do it, Phil ! üòÄ <a href="https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt">https://t.co/BLdBs3hxGt</a></p>
<p>‚Äî Á•ûË∞∑Ëã±Ê®πüçÄ Hideki KamiyaüçÄ (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1896473842950041682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Microsoft seems interested in resuming old partnerships with Japanese development studios, as shown earlier this year with the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/">Ninja Gaiden 4 and the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, there could be some interest from the publisher in working together with Hideki Kamiya's new studio for another project which could incorporate some of the features that the legendary creator liked so much in Scalebound. Since the project has only been briefly mentioned a couple of times since its cancelation, and not in <a href="https://wccftech.com/scalebound-rough-development-missed-milestones-stopped-payments-kamiya-takes-time-health/">the best of lights</a>, however, it definitely feels like that ship has sailed, never to come back.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, Hideki Kamiya's new studio, Clovers, is working on a new entry in the Okami series in collaboration with CAPCOM. The game, which will be released on PC and consoles on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date, will be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">RE Engine</a>, which is allowing the studio to fully realize Kamiya-san's vision.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mod-addresses-stuttering-issues-caused-by-anti-tamper-tech.1126728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Many of the Monster Hunter Wilds performance issues on PC may have become a thing of the past, thanks to a new version of a popular mod available for all games powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, modder Praydog released a new version of the REFramework mod, which significantly reduces the micro-stuttering issues caused by the game's anti-tamper tech by preventing constant scanning. The mod also addresses some crashing issues caused by DRM as well. You can find this new version of the mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, but if you're having issues with it like other users are reporting, you can use any of the previous nightly builds available on <a href="https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> that seem to be more stable as of now.</p>
<p>Performance issues aren't the only issues that impact the Monster Hunter Wilds experience, as the low challenge level for the story and a good portion of the postgame High Rank can be a little offputting for those who mastered previous generation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. Thankfully, some mods are already available to address the low challenge level of the game, allowing hunters to<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/"> increase both monsters' health and attack power.</a></p>
<p>The above issues aside, Monster Hunter Wilds is undoubtedly among the finest entries in the series. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-1-0-3-patch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-1-03-patch-is-now-live-addresses-an-amd-gpus-issue-and-more.1126716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-1-0-3-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth patch is now live on PC, introducing a fix for an AMD Radeon GPUs-specific issue and some improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.00.3 patch, which is around 18.3 GB big for the Steam version of the game, introduces game stability improvements, fixing several unspecified bugs. The new patch also fixes an issue that caused crashes while playing the game using certain AMD Radeon GPUs and reduces the package size when downloading on Steam Deck, which is a great improvement for those who have limited storage space on their systems. Unfortunately, this seems to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2909400/view/527588008025654786?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything the patch does</a>, so it's yet another minor patch that doesn't address the performance issue that many are experiencing.</p>
<p>Considering how the main development team seems to have fully moved on to the development of the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, it's not surprising to see Final Fantasy VII Rebirth not getting any new features. Thankfully, modders have come to the rescue once again, adding features not available in the vanilla game, such as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special menu</a> that allows quick editing of the combat party and even adding Vincent and Cid to the party, although the two characters are not playable.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"> review.</a></p>
