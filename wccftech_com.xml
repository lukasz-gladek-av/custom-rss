			<p>With the reveal of the Mortal Kombat 1 Definitive Edition earlier this month, MK1 fans feared the worst. That Warner Bros. and NetherRealm had officially moved on from the game, and MK1 would have no more new DLC characters or story chapters added.</p>
<p>At the end of last week, WB confirmed those fears, announcing in <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810">a post on X</a> that while Mortal Kombat 1 will receive bug support and balance adjustments in the future, "<em>there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We are hearing players' requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1</em>," the post began, "<em>and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition - Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NT7MUHRcKY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MK1 launched with <a href="https://www.mortalkombat.com/en-ca/roster">22 playable fighters</a> in the base game, and through DLC Kombat Packs and its Khaos Reigns expansion, added another 13 fighters to the full roster. Last September, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/">getting ready to launch</a> its Khaos Reigns expansion, and series co-creator <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1838566106119749948">Ed Boon was reassuring fans</a> that NetherRealm was prepared to support Mortal Kombat 1 "<em>for a long time to come</em>."</p>
<p>Eight months later, NetherRealm is moving on to its next project, which many are speculating will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/injustice-3-teased-by-multiversus-dataminer/">Injustice 3</a>. NetherRealm has been going back and forth from Mortal Kombat to Injustice for more than a decade now, with the jump from Mortal Kombat 11 to Mortal Kombat 1 being the only time where Injustice was seemingly skipped.</p>
<p>It's not impossible that NetherRealm has another MK game lined up, but it feels unlikely. Hopefully, it won't be too long before we officially know what NetherRealm has lined up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-director-says-persona-5-has-the-best-combat-visuals-and-ui/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the incredible success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Game Director Guillaume Broche was featured in a series of interviews to discuss the game's development. For example, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that he started working on the project due to his boredom while working at Ubisoft. Then, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-nintendo-switch-2-could-be-interesting-says-sandfall-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened up</a> to a potential Nintendo Switch 2 port for the game.</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2505223a#i-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Japanese website Denfaminicogamer</a>, Broche discussed the influences of previous classics in the JRPG genre. Out of all of them, he singled out P-Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-5-stealing-hearts-defying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persona 5</a> as the best game when it comes to combat visuals and user interface.</p>
<p><em>I grew up playing games, especially JRPGs, since I was a child, so I can't really say which elements of which titles influenced me. After playing a variety of games, I had my own ideas of "this part is interesting" and "this is what I think is the most interesting turn-based RPG." That was my final vision. What I wanted to focus on was sublimating my own view of JRPGs that I had developed since childhood and adding my own originality to it. In terms of specific titles that have influenced me, the list is endless, but they include Final Fantasy series VI to X, Shadow Hearts, Suikoden, the Atelier series, Lost Odyssey, and the Persona series.</em></p>
<p><em>In particular, I think that "Persona 5" is the best game in the world in terms of battle depiction and UI creation. I was greatly influenced by the dramatic camera changes every time the player operates, and the production unfolds like watching a movie. I further changed the camera work to suit my own work and added my own particular touches to it, which is what I did with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I still haven't been able to fully incorporate the good parts of Persona 5, so I'm still working on improving the UI.</em></p>
<p><em>By the way, while the gameplay is influenced by JRPGs, the way the story is constructed was influenced by the French novels I've read, so I think the story is French.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is likely to be a strong Game of the Year candidate, especially now that Grand Theft Auto VI's massive shadow has moved to 2026.

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since its 1.0 release, which launched in late 2020, but so has technology, as the Nintendo Switch 2 version puts to real shame the original release running on PlayStation 4 Pro.</p>
<p>A new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1/videos">Cycu1</a> puts recently released footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version running side-by-side with footage of the unpatched 1.0 release running on PlayStation 4 Pro, easily highlighting not only how much the game has been improved since launch on pretty much every front, from stability to visuals, but also how good the Switch 2 version looks, relative to the hardware.</p>

<p>Besides sharing the comparison video above, Cycu1 shared other comparison videos comparing the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 with the PlayStation 5 version running with ray tracing, the Xbox Series S version, the latest version of the game available on PlayStation 4 Pro, and the PC version running on Steam Deck. You can check out these videos below.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day the system releases, on June 5th. The new version of the game will include both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, which will be included in the retail cartridge, requiring no additional download. This, among a few other things, highlights well how CDPR has put <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">a lot of effort</a> into a port that is setting out to be among the most impressive to be released in the console's launch window.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Nintendo Direct to Air the Week of the Switch 2 or Shortly After â€“ Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nerw-nintendo-direct-switch-2-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-nintendo-direct-to-air-the-week-of-the-switch-2-or-shortly-after-%E2%80%93-rumor.1198809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nerw-nintendo-direct-switch-2-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next Nintendo Direct presentation should air in the next couple of weeks, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tvph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PH Brasil</a>, who previously revealed correct information related to Nintendo's games and presentations in the past, revealed during a recent livestream, as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-direct-speculation-st11-fami-friends-pilgrimage-read-the-guidelines-before-posting.13733/page-26#post-1810158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiiboards forums</a>, that the next Direct will air the same week the Nintendo Switch 2 launches, so the week of June 5th, or shortly after. No information on what could be shown during the presentation has been provided, though it will likely provide release dates for all games confirmed to launch this year, but whose precise release dates have yet to be determined, like the highly anticipated Metroid Prime 4: Echoes, which is launching on both Nintendo Switch systems, the Final Fantasy VII Remake port and others. Given that it is supposedly airing in the "Non-E3" week, some surprises could also be revealed.</p>
<p>The previous Nintendo Direct, which aired last month, focused entirely on the Nintendo Switch 2, providing a proper look at the system following its reveal back in January. Besides detailing some of the new system features, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-supports-live-subtitles-and-text-to-speech/">GameChat,</a> the presentation also revealed the Game Key Cards, which only include a download code for the game, but that can be used on multiple systems without tying the included game to a single Nintendo account, how to access the Nintendo Switch 2 editions of the original Switch games and more.</p>
<p>As the Nintendo Switch 2 is not too far from release and the Summer announcement season is ready to kick off, we will likely learn soon if a Nintendo Direct is airing in the next few weeks. We will let you know more as soon as more information comes in, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-team-is-making-tech-changes-to-make-cross-play-possible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADaBPspkAL8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth and final episode of The Elder Scrolls Online podcast</a>, a special series produced with Kinda Funny Gamecast, ZeniMax Online's Head of Studio Matt Firor and Game Director Rich Lambert revealed that the studio is making changes to the game's underlying technology to potentially introduce cross-play in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> Anything is possible. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matt Firor:</strong> We're working on doing some underlying tech changes that would make it possible. We know how important it is. Again, we started working on this game in 2007. We didn't even think about two platforms, much less six or whatever we support now.</em></p>
<p><em>That whole concept, the "this is an Xbox" thing, because that philosophy now comes from the top, makes it easier to get the agreements done, to do what you need to do to do cross-play, which is an extremely long GDC presentation of technology, you know, handshaking other technologies. You don't just flip the switch.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> And it's not just a technology problem, either. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matt Firor:</strong> So, it's something we know about. It's something we really want to do. We're working on the underlying tech for it and we'll see if we can make it happen.</em></p>
<p>I had asked Rich Lambert about The Elder Scrolls Online cross-play in our previous interviews, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gamescom-2024-qa-beyond-the-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recently at Gamescom 2024</a>, when he said:</p>
<p><em>It's never been a no; it's always been a holy hell. We made many decisions in 2007 that are very difficult to change, and then we'd have to get all of the first parties together to make sure that they're good with how we would go about implementing. It's a huge technical challenge to solve. Do I think we will get there in the future? Maybe. I think that's where technology is just going in general. People just want to be together and make it easy and remove all the friction to play with each other. But like I said, we started building this game in 2007, when that wasn't even remotely a thought in anybody's head back then.</em></p>
<p>It looks like the ZeniMax team has decided to give it a solid try, even though they haven't committed to cross-play coming to the game yet.</p>
<p>The popular MMORPG is transitioning from its previous yearly expansion model to a seasonal model beginning this June <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Seasons of the Worm Cult</a>. The update will also add a major new feature, multiclassing.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, the team behind the ambitious Skywind total conversion mod has released a new 20-minute gameplay demo focused on the quest to rescue Joncis Dalomax. It had been two years <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-new-skywind-gameplay-demo-is-the-perfect-way-to-celebrate-morrowinds-21st-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the previous gameplay demo</a>, so fans of the mod are definitely elated to see it again, although the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-first-bts-progress-update-video-in-3-years-team-shows-progress-in-each-department/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did release a video</a> detailing their work's progress last year.</p>
<p>This time, the video mostly showcases the original Morrowind quest remade in Skywind. However, before closing, the modders provided a new update on the project's status:</p>
<ul>
<li>2D Art: all base game art complete; now working on nice-to-have art and extras.</li>
<li>Writing: all base game writing complete, now working on flavor texts and extras.</li>
<li>Coding: spellcrafting and Ui close to complete; character creation UI close to complete.</li>
<li>3D Art: almost all essential creatures modelled. Last three tilesets being worked on or finalized.</li>
<li>Animation: making good progress om creature animations</li>
<li>Asset Implementation: gradually progressing as 3D tasks are completed</li>
<li>Interior Level Design: 60% done and ready for review</li>
<li>Exterior Level Design: only Red Mountain, Ashlands, and Zafirbel Bay are still in progress.</li>
<li>Navmesh: progressing steadily</li>
<li>Visual Effects: strong progress on weathers, spell VFX 75% complete</li>
<li>Sound Effects: all armor foleys now completed; world ambience and creatures being worked on</li>
<li>Quality Assurance: progressing steadily</li>
<li>Quest Implementation: progressing steadily</li>
<li>Voice Acting: now looking to fill our last few rows, including Dagoth ur, Vivec, and Yagrum</li>
<li>VA Mastering: most productive year yet; working on documentation and workflow</li>
<li>Filecutting (voice review and tagging): progressing steadily</li>
<li>Music: Applications will reopen soon; composers for combat music wanted</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Skywind Gameplay Demo - Rescue Joncis Dalomax" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8wWpMR5mo-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Skywind team still hopes to <a href="https://tesrskywind.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find more volunteers</a> with expertise in 3D clothing modeling, voice mixing and mastering, and implementation of 3D assets via the Creation Kit. Some other openings don't need previous experience, such as "filecutting", which is checking and tagging voice actors' recordings, as well as navmeshing, which involves creating walkable paths for NPCs, and translators to help localize the game's text into other languages.</p>
<p>Skywind doesn't have a release date yet. It does seem like it'll be a while before we get to play it, but at least we should get Skyblivion (<a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still set to launch in 2025</a>) in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-developer-is-hiring-for-current-next-gen-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games is hiring Cinematic Animators at two of its five global offices (<a href="https://cloudimperiumgames.com/jobs/frankfurt/cinematic-animator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frankfurt</a> and <a href="https://cloudimperiumgames.com/jobs/uk/cine-anim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manchester</a>), with the specific request that candidates have prior experience developing for current/next-generation consoles.</p>
<p><em>As a Cinematic Animator, you will be part of a team of Animators and Cinematic Designers dedicated to bringing to life the performances of some of the best actors in the industry and tying them into the Squadron 42 narrative. Youâ€™ll be developing scenes with multiple branching options, deep and emotional narrative, and exciting action. </em><em>Founded in 2012, Cloud Imperium Games creates cutting-edge videogames that defy expectations. Weâ€™re currently developing Star Citizen, a record-breaking multiplayer online space sim, and Squadron 42, a cinematic single-player adventure set in the same universe.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Professional experience in game animation development, ideally on current/next-gen consoles.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Fans have taken this as a potential indication that Cloud Imperium Games intends to port Star Citizen, or at least its single player campaign Squadron 42, to consoles such as Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.</p>
<p>So far, CIG hasn't announced any console port. Indeed, the two games have been proudly developed from the beginning only for PC, with Game Director Chris Roberts openly stating that the incredibly ambitious project would only be possible on this platform.</p>
<p>However, we have to consider that it's been a long time since those early days. Consoles have made great strides since, and what was once cutting-edge technology that could not run on PlayStation 4/Xbox One may be feasible on PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X, or at least on their successors, which should launch between 2027 and 2028.</p>
<p>After many years of development, Squadron 42 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a 2026 release window alongside a new gameplay demo during the latest CitizenCon event. The campaign will feature high-profile actors such as Gary Oldman, Mark Hamill, Mark Strong, Henry Cavill, Ben Mendelsohn, Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, Liam Cunningham, and Gillian Anderson.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, a report <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-dev-has-reportedly-lost-integral-staff-on-server-meshing-team-hit-with-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Cloud Imperium Games had recently lost key staff with expertise in 'server meshing', a feature that the developers has described as one of the 'key technologies to get the jump points working in-game by allowing star systems to seamlessly move in and out of memory without the need for loading screens'.</p>
<p>This wouldn't affect Squadron 42, since it's single player, but it could damage Star Citizen. We reached out to CIG about that report, but have received no response so far.</p>
