			<p>The rumors of a <strong>Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake</strong> have gotten a lot louder over the past month. To kick things off, dedicated CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-resident-evil-remakes-code-veronica-2027-zero-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed in mid-December</a> that Code Veronica and <strong>Resident Evil Zero</strong> would be <strong>the next remakes</strong> on the schedule, with the former targeting a 2027 launch and the latter aiming for a 2028 debut. A few days ago, he added that the closest game to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-resident-evil-remake-that-starts-with-c-and-ends-ode-veronica-will-be-announced-this-year-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be formally announced sometime in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Now, though, we have another renowned insider confirming the rumor and even adding to it. <strong>Nate the Hate</strong>, probably <strong>the most reliable insider</strong> at the moment (he also won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award in a community poll on Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors), <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Yes, Code Veronica is being remade and deep in development. Target of release is the first half of 2027.</em></p>



<p>This means we might be just a year and a few months away from being able to play the game. So far, all three Resident Evil remakes have been successful, although 2 and 4 have been more successful and critically acclaimed than 3. RE2 Remake is now <strong>CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time</strong> with <strong>16.30 million units</strong>, only behind Monster Hunter World and Rise, and the far more recent RE4 Remake (which launched in March 2023) is closing in with <strong>11.10 million units</strong> already sold. RE3 Remake, on the other hand, is at <strong>10.60 million units</strong>, which is still not shabby.</p>



<p>In late 2023, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-more-remakes-coming-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> they were working on more remakes. Franchise fans had long been yearning for the Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake, and for good reason: <strong>the original game was originally an exclusive for SEGA's final console, the Dreamcast</strong>. Sure, it eventually launched on PlayStation 2 and later on GameCube, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, but by then, it was old and didn't get much traction. </p>



<p>For those who haven't played it and are looking forward to this remake, the game takes place about three months after Resident Evil 2. Its protagonists are <strong>the Redfield siblings</strong>, Claire and Chris, who desperately try to survive a viral outbreak <strong>at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean</strong> and <strong>a research facility in Antarctica</strong>.</p>
