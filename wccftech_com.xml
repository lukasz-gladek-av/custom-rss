			<p>Resident Evil 9 is taking a long time to release because it will be a reinvention of the series, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, well-known Resident Evil series insider Dusk Golem talked about the ninth main entry in the survival horror series by CAPCOM, saying that fans will realize why the new game is taking this long to release when it is revealed, as it is a big reinvention of the series as much as the fourth and seventh entries in the series were back in the day that will be very ambitious and will try new things that will make it play anything like its direct predecessors or the remakes. Dusk Golem also seems certain it will be revealed this year, so hopefully, it will be part of the usual slew of summer reveals in a few months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(2/2) is taking so long is because it's like a big reinvention of the series, to the same level as RE4 &amp; RE7. It's not going to play just like RE7/RE8 or the Remakes, it's trying new things &amp; very ambitious. It will almost definitely be revealed this year, so just hold tight.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1901499831455186984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Very little is currently known about Resident Evil 9 other than the fact that it has been in development for a while. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/">Early rumors</a> suggested that Leon and Jill would play a big role in the game, but according to Dusk Golem, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/">these rumors are not correct</a>. In development together with the next main entry in the series is also a Resident Evil Zero remake, which will be the next series remake to release.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 9 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-compared-to-elden-ring-for-its-player-freedom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet may be very different from what we're used to in Naughty Dog games. The studio's trademark has usually been cinematic, narrative-driven games, at least since Uncharted and, of course, The Last of Us.</p>
<p>However, MinnMax's Ben Hanson teased that he had heard from his sources that the studio's next project was being compared to something else. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhdtygZnYqI&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2024 podcast</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>I heard from somebody very in the know who worked on the game that they're like Jesus Christ... the tone was like you are all not ready for how amazing this is going to be... and the tone was (I'm not going to say the game that they referenced to compare it)... but they compared to a game with a lot of player freedom.</em></p>
<p>Back then, the game hadn't been unveiled yet. That happened a couple of months later at The Game Awards 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a gorgeous debut trailer</a>. Now that the dust has settled, in the latest episode of The MinnMax Show, Ben Hanson has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rcMrvLXPNY&amp;t=7232s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> exactly which game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was being likened to:</p>
<p><em>I think it's fine to say it now: that game was Elden Ring that it was compared to back then. If I would have said 'Naughty Dog's next game is like Elden Ring' and then that reveal trailer came out, I feel like we would have been lit on fire. But now that idea of, okay, it's taking place on one planet, kind of uncovering the history of this world, you can kind of see a little more where they might be going with that.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Neil Druckmann has since provided a bit more context. Before the reveal, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the new game was fresh to the studio, and he was curious about the players' reactions. This certainly fits such a big change in the degree of player freedom compared to Naughty Dog's most recent games.</p>
<p>Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as recently as last week that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would be a lonely game for players, unlike Uncharted and The Last of Us, where the main characters were almost always accompanied by allies. This is another hint that MinnMax's report is correct.</p>
<p>Of course, many questions remain. Is this a full-fledged action RPG, then? Can players explore the world of Sempiria in whichever order they see fit? Naughty Dog will undoubtedly respond in due time, although the game creator himself has also warned the project is still some ways off, so we might have to wait a while before learning all those details.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, a fan-made standalone remake of Counter-Strike called CS: Legacy was unveiled with an announcement trailer. It's being made by a small group of developers who previously worked on CSPromod between 2008 and 2012 and have since got back together for this new project.</p>
<p>According to them, CS: Legacy will be a completely standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6, built from the ground up with entirely custom code and game assets (textures, models, sounds, animations, UI, et cetera). The game is built on Valve's official 2013 Source Engine SDK codebase, with the developers making their own major rewrites to the renderer, shaders and various systems. It runs on its own advanced custom branch of Valve's official Source Engine 2013 public SDK. The aforementioned tweaks include a custom renderer, Physically Based Rendering shaders, a wholly rewritten reflection system, a fully custom UI, custom in-house source engine tools, and many more features.</p>
<p>The early access will include five maps: Dust2, Nuke, Train, Poolday, Aim_map. Fans can support CS: Legacy by subscribing <a href="https://www.patreon.com/CSLegacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the team's Patreon</a>, which includes six tiers:</p>
