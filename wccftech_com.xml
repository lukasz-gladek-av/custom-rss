			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is officially out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. If you pre-loaded the game, you can jump in right now and start your journey with the latest release in the annual shooter mega-franchise, seeing everything this year's entry has to offer. Which, players have immediately noticed, also includes a slew of AI-generated slop used for in-game rewards.</p>



<p>This isn't the first time we've seen Activision use generative AI for assets within Call of Duty. It did so <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">in 2023 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">in 2024 for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, with both instances facing severe backlash from players. So we can't really be surprised that there's AI slop stuffed into Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but what is surprising is just how much of it fills the game.</p>



<p>User <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988982194916999619">Kumesicles on X (formerly Twitter)</a> shared an image of the in-game calling card rewards that all feature AI-generated assets, with their post becoming the lightning rod that is drawing plenty of attention, but it's not the only example of AI assets in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Activision also used AI-generated assets within the campaign, and for the prestige icons that players grind hours to attain. It's also likely that there are more AI assets to be found, though at the time of this writing and considering that the game only released today, these examples are the ones that have caught players' eyes and ire the most.</p>



<p>The replies to Kumesicles' post are a quick look at how players feel about the game being stuffed with AI slop for these assets, even if they are a small part of the game. Another look is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash">the game's Steam page</a>, where several player reviews are also criticizing the use of AI slop, on top of other issues with the game, like how the campaign cannot be paused, is always online, and will kick you from a level if you go AFK, forcing you to restart it.</p>



<p>At some point, you really have to wonder what you're paying for here. Cosmetic changes for your character and your profile in games make good goals for players to reach and good microtransactions because they were, historically, carefully crafted by artists to look cool, so that when you saw it, you wanted to grind the hours it would take to earn those small calling cards and profile pins, to have them on your profile as a badge of your own gaming prowess.</p>



<p>Of course, that's not the whole Call of Duty experience, but having a cool-looking profile that flashes when you get the winning kill of a match or make the best play in a round is an ingrained aspect of the quintessential Call of Duty experience. Why should you be getting less than what you got in previous games? It's not like Activision can't pay artists to make something that players might actually want to have on their profiles.</p>



<p>It may be a small element of the game, but it's a big showcase of just how much Activision does not care about getting the details right. So long as Call of Duty remains the commercial juggernaut it's been for over a decade, Activision will continue to degrade its quality to see how much it can get away with ripping players off. Even if Activision backtracks and replaces these assets with art actually made by humans, we have no reason not to expect the same rigamarole next year, likely even more egregious than what we're seeing now.</p>

			<p>Valve believes the new Steam Machine can succeed where the first models failed, and according to two senior engineers, the reason is simple: the software finally caught up, leading to a wider game catalogue.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Yazan Aldehayyat stated that one of the reasons the original Steam Machines failed was the lack of software, as very few games were compatible with SteamOS (based on Linux), and only a few games could run well using other compatibility tools like Wine.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier," </em>Aldehayyat said. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux, that are originally meant for Windows.</em>"</p>



<p>Pierre-Loup Griffais echoes the sentiment, saying that the small game catalogue was the reason the older Steam Machines failed, highlighting that many of the features of the new Steam Machine, such as the ease of use that's closer to a console than a PC, were already there. And with the system seeing limited adoption, developers had no incentive to develop Linux ports of their games. The work done on Proton since the launch of the Steam Deck has now ensured the new Steam Machine will have a big game catalogue from launch.</p>



<p>SteamOS has also been improved a lot since the launch of the original Steam Machine, and plenty of performance optimization work has been done on the operating system to improve the Steam Deck performance. For the new system, Valve has done <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"a tonne of work on desktop performance, ray tracing, and all that stuff,"</em> and now, it is expected that the same performance advantages introduced on Steam Deck over time after its launch with work on SteamOS will be available on the new Steam Machine as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-with-good-software-optimization-the-new-steam-machine-could-punch-well-above-its-specs">With Good Software Optimization, the new Steam Machine Could Punch Well Above Its Specs</h2>



<p>The new Valve system won't be a powerhouse exactly. Its official technical specifications, revealed earlier this week, which you can find below, position the system between the Xbox Series S and the PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>I/O</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Displays</td><td><strong>DisplayPort 1.4:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining<br><strong>HDMI 2.0:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 120Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, CEC</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>- Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (front)<br>- Two USB-A 2.0 High speed (back)<br>- One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (back)</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6 Cores /12 Threads<br>- Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 Compute Units<br>- 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Two models, both with a high-speed microSD slot:<br>- 512GB NVMe SSD<br>- 2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Although the new Steam Machine is expected to run games at 4K@60Hz, early tests suggest some games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, may struggle to hit these performance targets. The system, however, is still far from launch, and with further improvements to its software side, the new Steam Machine could deliver better performance than in its current pre-release state, although the 8 GB of VRAM is definitely a limiting factor, and will be even more so in the future.</p>



<p>And if the new Steam Machine becomes as popular as the Steam Deck, it wouldn't be surprising to see either presets dedicated to the machine or even Steam Machine native builds that deliver better performance, as we have seen with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-native-steam-deck-build-performance/">Cronos: The New Dawn native builds.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-price-will-determine-the-steam-machine-s-success">Price Will Determine the Steam Machine's Success</h2>



<p>With the game catalogue issue of the original Steam Machines solved, it will likely be the price that determines the success of the Steam Machine. Valve is well aware of this, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Yazan Aldehayyat confirmed it will be very competitive</a>. How much it will be remains to be seen, as the cost of the system when <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">it launches early next year</a> has yet to be confirmed.</p>
