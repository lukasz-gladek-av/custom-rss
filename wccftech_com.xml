			<p>A new version of the Bloodborne Remaster Project is now available for download, introducing new visual improvements to the emulated game on PC.</p>
<p>The new version of the impressive fan-made remaster developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fromsoftserve</a>, version 0.84, introduces more pointlights to Central Yharnam, Cathedral Ward, Old Yharnam and Cainhurst, while improving the quality of all pointlights in all maps, changing some reflectance maps and more. The changes introduced in the new version of the project, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">Nexus Mods</a>, are showcased in great detail by the project's developer in the video below.</p>

<p>It's great to see how far the Bloodborne Remaster Project is going, considering a few months ago none of the PlayStation 4 emulators available could emulate the game. The rapid progress made by the ShadPS4 emulator, however, finally made it possible to enjoy one of the best games developed by FromSoftware ever made, alongside a few other <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-project-end-2024-montage-shadps4-0-5-1/">PlayStation 4 exclusives</a> such as Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise.</p>
<p>While fans are developing the Bloodborne remaster Sony doesn't seem interested in releasing, the Japanese company is unlikely to return to the franchise without FromSoftware's involvement. Former PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/">commented</a> on the matter, saying that Hidetaka Miyazaki is definitely interested in returning to the series, having really loved the original game, but he's now so busy that he cannot develop a remaster or a sequel himself, and won't allow anyone else to do so. PlayStation's inaction on the matter, Yoshida theorizes, is because they are respecting his wish.</p>
