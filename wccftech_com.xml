			<p>Will Rockstar's GTA 6 be released before The Elder Scrolls VI? That's the question posed to Bethesda Creative Director Todd Howard <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRzIJQ-CGtt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Power Unlimited</a> on a red carpet for the presentation of the second season of Amazon's Fallout TV series, which airs on Prime Video starting on December 17.</p>



<p>Howard suggested GTA 6 would indeed launch before his studio's next big project. He then went on to profess his great respect and admiration for Rockstar's work.</p>



<p><em><strong>What game do you think releases sooner? Is it GTA 6, is it The Elder Scrolls VI, or is it Fallout 5?</strong></em></p>



<p><em>I got my fingers crossed for GTA 6. </em></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think it will really come next year?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>I do. They are doing an incredible job. I know the folks at Rockstar and I think they are some of the absolute best at bringing a virtual world to life. It's a world that feels like it would go on even if you weren't there.</em></p>



<p>It's high praise from Howard, but then again, gamers who have experience with both franchises are aware of some similarities. While The Elder Scrolls is, of course, a roleplaying game and Grand Theft Auto is not, both try to achieve world simulations that are among the best in the industry.</p>



<p>Regarding the release window prediction, it isn't too much of a shock. Fallout 5 was never a realistic chance, as it remains in pre-production while Bethesda focuses on finishing The Elder Scrolls VI. Plus, it's not even been a whole month since Todd Howard himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that TES VI is 'still a long way off'.</p>



<p>Granted, on that occasion, he also teased that he'd love to make it 'just appear' when it's ready, but the chances that he'll be able to do that before November 19, 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new GTA VI release date</a>, are slim to none. There are still some people who believe Rockstar may delay the next Grand Theft Auto yet another time, but it's unlikely. They've never delayed a game three times in their entire history so far.</p>



<p>As for The Elder Scrolls VI, the track record of Bethesda Game Studios tells us that it took them nearly four years between The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and then another four years between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4 (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its Anniversary Edition to celebrate the 10th anniversary). Sure, Fallout 76 (just <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated</a> with the largest map expansion to date and The Ghoul character from the TV show) launched only three years later, but that was essentially Fallout 4 modded to support multiplayer and set in Appalachia. </p>



<p>Starfield took five years to make, but it happened during COVID and it was also the first sci-fi game made by the developer, not to mention their first new IP in 25 years. They had to create the whole space travel and combat systems. It stands to reason that TES VI will require four years, thus putting its target window to around late 2027. On the other hand, GTA 6 will most likely be released in November 2026, and even if it slips a bit, it wouldn't be delayed beyond the end of Take-Two's fiscal quarter (March 31).</p>

			<p>Amidst the veritable sea of announcements (<a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samson</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hello-sunshine-preview-you-the-desert-and-your-giant-robot-best-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intriguing-sci-fi-first-person-bullet-hell-game-luna-abyss-gets-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna Abyss</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-shown-in-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of War IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/survival-pirate-adventure-game-crosswind-gets-rebranded-to-windrose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crosswind/Windrose</a>, to name a few) from the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase, SOL Shogunate certainly stood out among the most impressive.</p>



<p>Small independent developer Chaos Manufacturing reimagines the sci-fi genre in samurai fashion. In this 'space opera action RPG', a powerful shogunate rules a colonized solar system. However, it's about to be challenged by protagonist Yuzuki, the broken heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. With no choice left but to become an outlaw ronin, Yuzuki seeks to carve a bloody path of vengeance with a traditional ronin arsenal reforged for the battlefields of the future. As the game unfolds, new abilities and skill combinations are unlocked, enabling evolving tactics against increasingly challenging foes.</p>



<p>Yuzuki will explore the so-called Lunar Glass cities of SOL Shogunate, where artificial gravity and simulated night-time provide an Earth-like experience for the Moon's inhabitants, who also enjoy infrastructural wonders such as space elevators and high-speed rails. But beneath the bright skylines and opulent districts of the wealthy lie sprawling industrial zones where workers toil unseen to sustain the shogunate's pervasive influence.</p>



<p>According to the people behind SOL Shogunate, each metropolis on the Moon draws inspiration from a different era of Japanese history. To navigate these vertical districts, players must use gravity-assist gear. They will also uncover hidden layers within each biome and discover clues that unlock the mysteries of the game's backstory.</p>



<p>The developers at Chaos Manufacturing have designed combat to be all about precision, timing, and adaptability. Yuzuki is meant to feel like the ultimate space samurai, albeit genetically modified for the future of combat. Players will get to choose between various weapon types and can channel different types of energy into attacks to expose weaknesses, stagger foes, and create new tactical opportunities. As Yuzuki's abilities grow and her enhancements, like bio-ceramic skin and enhanced vision, evolve, new techniques shift how battles flow and how players overcome increasingly dangerous enemies.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The pinnacle of combat encounters are, of course, the boss fights. The studio promises dynamic, cinematic, multi-phase boss encounters that challenge players to identify and exploit weaknesses. Meanwhile, the music changes as battles intensify, featuring dynamic tracks hand-crafted for the game by talented recording artists, including Japanese rock band AliA.</p>



<p>SOL Shogunate is still in early development, but we already know the game will be released on PC and consoles. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> also lists the surprisingly low system requirements.</p>
