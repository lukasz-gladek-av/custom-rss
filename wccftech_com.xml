			<p>Nintendo has finally put to bed a bit of confusion players had about the Nintendo Switch 2. The console supports variable refresh rate (VRR) while in handheld mode, but Nintendo has officially clarified that it does <strong>not</strong> support VRR while in docked mode.</p>
<p>The confusion began when, after the full reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 at the beginning of April, Nintendo's websites in the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/">all mentioned that VRR was supported</a> in docked mode. It was then removed from the US and Canadian websites, but kept on the UK and EU websites. The mention of VRR being supported in docked mode was later <a href="https://x.com/oliemack/status/1912925904046899619">removed</a> from the UK and EU websites as well.</p>
<p>So did it support VRR in docked mode, or didn't it? The removal seemed to suggest that it didn't, but Nintendo had yet to provide a clear response.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">Nintendo Life</a>, they finally provided that clear response and apologized for the mistake of publishing it on their websites in the first place.</p>
<p>"<em>Nintendo Switch 2 supports VRR in handheld mode only. The incorrect information was initially published on the Nintendo Switch 2 website, and we apologize for the error</em>," the statement reads.</p>
<p>When asked if VRR support for docked mode would be added in a future update, Nintendo replied, "<em>We have nothing to announce on this topic</em>."</p>
<p>A disappointing end to this saga, but an end for now, nonetheless. It's always possible that Nintendo is working on adding VRR support for docked mode for a future firmware update, but at least for launch, we know that VRR is a handheld-only feature.</p>

			<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick provided an interesting reply to an investor's question about Nintendo Switch 2 support during the publisher's Q4 FY 2025 earnings call yesterday. Zelnick outlined that Take-Two is planning record support for a Nintendo console launch (Borderlands 4, Civilization VII, WWE 2K 2025); at the same time, he clarified that the publisher isn't necessarily going to port all of its new games to the platform, highlighting potential opportunities for catalog (old) games.</p>
<p>Here's the quote, transcribed by <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-taketwos-q4-fy2025-revenue-beats-forecast-stock-dips-93CH-4049404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investing.com</a>:</p>
<p><em>You know, we’re launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that’s, I think, a bigger array of releases than we’ve ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform. You know, historically, being a third party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo’s been very forthcoming in addressing that, and we’re stepping up too because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis. We obviously wanna be where the consumers are. But, you know, we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities.</em></p>
<p>It's hard not to imagine he might have been referring to Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar's blockbuster has historically ditched Nintendo platforms, so it wouldn't be that surprising if the same happened with GTA VI. On the other hand, having the biggest game on what analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are describing as the console that will set new sales records</a> would be perfect from the publisher's standpoint.</p>
<p>Besides, the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving powerful enough to run complex games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Star Wars Outlaws, Hogwarts Legacy, Elden Ring, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a> (which is published by Take-Two). Of course, we don't know yet what kind of innovations GTA VI will introduce in terms of AI and physics. They could well be too much to deal with for the Nintendo Switch 2's 8-core ARM Cortex-A78C CPU.</p>
<p>In other news, the Take-Two CEO also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-to-2026-was-important-for-allowing-rockstar-to-seek-perfection-says-take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the GTA VI delay during the earnings call.</p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 is in the works, alongside PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">GameReactor</a>, sources close to Rockstar Games revealed that the studio is working on a port of the excellent open-world game originally released in 2018 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One that could be released as early as this year. Besides working on this port, Rockstar Games is reportedly working on a Red Dead Redemption 2 update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S that will improve graphics and performance. This patch could be released with the Nintendo Switch 2 or later.</p>
<p>While Rockstar Games releasing a Red Dead Redemption 2 current generation upgrade via a free patch doesn't precisely align with how the studio has handled current generation upgrades, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Grand Theft Auto VI having been delayed to 2026</a>, both the developer and Take-Two are likely looking at ways to fill their release schedule for the rest of the year, and releasing new versions of their highly celebrated open-world game would be an excellent way of doing so. Still, without official confirmation, we must take everything above with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about one of the best open-world games ever released by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review</a>.</p>
