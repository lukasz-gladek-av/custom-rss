			<p>The game Silent Hill Townfall may be launching in just four months, according to a Mexican retailer. The store in question is called Liverpool Mexico, and no, that's not a mistake: it's a chain of department stores founded in 1847 by Jean Baptiste Ebrard. Originally, most of its goods were imported from Liverpool to Mexico, hence the name.</p>



<p>Anyway, as <a href="https://cdaction.pl/newsy/silent-hill-townfall-z-nieodlegla-premiera-meksykanski-sklep-potwierdza-plotki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by the Polish website CD Action</a>, the store briefly listed the game for March 26, 2026. That's certainly not an usual placeholder date, which made fans suspicious. After the news started circulating on the Web, the retailer quickly <a href="https://www.liverpool.com.mx/tienda/pdp/silent-hill-townfall-estandar-para-ps5/1185330351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the listing</a>, prompting speculation that the game publisher (Annapurna Interactive) had reached out to ensure the information wouldn't spread ahead of time.</p>



<p>The most likely scenario is that Liverpool Mexico jumped the gun on publishing the game page before it actually received the green light from the proper channels. When it comes to the timeline, the launch date makes sense. Silent Hill Townfall was one of the games that KONAMI <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> in October 2022 to confirm the revival of the beloved survival horror franchise. </p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f have since been released, both receiving praise in their own rights. Townfall is arguably the most risky project, though, since it's a spin-off in development at a studio (Screen Burn, formerly known as No Code) that only ever made adventure games. Nothing has been shared yet; fans were even worried about a potential cancellation last year following Annapurna Interactive's issues, but the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-is-still-in-development-despite-annapurna-interactives-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Townfall was still in development.</p>



<p>If the game is really this close to launch, we should probably get official news very soon, probably by the end of the year, with Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards event being the most likely venue for such an announcement.</p>

			<p>Sarah Bond, who was promoted to the role of Xbox president nearly two years ago, has been featured in a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Fortune Magazine</a>. After a brief introduction about her earlier career outside the games industry (she worked at McKinsey &amp; Company and later at T-Mobile), the conversation switched to her passion for gaming and her work at Microsoft.</p>



<p>The interviewer asked where hardware fits within Xbox's new multiplatform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-xbox-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything-is-an-Xbox</a> strategy, and Bond said everything starts with the console, adding that the next one will deliver a 'powerful experience'. This aligns with rumors suggesting that the next Xbox hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-performance-9070-xt-xbox-next-rtx-5080-rdna5-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be more powerful than Sony's PlayStation 6</a>.</p>



<p><em>Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, love the hardware experience, and so that is why we are working on our next generation hardware. It's going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that's what's really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud. And so, the Xbox experience starts with the console, but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</em></p>



<p>Not too long ago, rumors surfaced that Microsoft might be abandoning the console business altogether, following the dwindling sales of the current generation Xbox Series S and X hardware, but Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-is-100-percent-looking-at-making-things-in-the-future-says-president/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped in to confirm</a> that Microsoft is indeed still planning to produce new hardware in the future. </p>



<p>Of course, many gamers at this point wonder what the point is now that all Xbox games are available elsewhere, such as PC, mobile, and even previously rival console platforms. Brand fans used to answer that even without exclusives, Game Pass was too good a deal to pass on. That was true for a long time, but perhaps no more following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial price hike (+50%) for the Ultimate tier</a>, which is now the only one to guarantee access to all first-party games, including the new Call of Duty, on day one.</p>



<p>In the chat with Fortune Magazine, Sarah Bond also briefly talked about Game Pass, clarifying that Xbox's approach is wider than simply reproducing Netflix in the gaming space:</p>



<p><em>People have said that, and I think it's that, but I also think it's more than that. We support every business model. So if you want to subscribe and get access to your library games, you can absolutely do that. If you want to buy your games and build up your own library, you can also do that. It's really about actually giving as much access and choice to people, to not locking into any one model, but letting people actually pick the way they want to consume their games, and also letting developers choose pick the way that they want to monetize their games and reach the most users.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hytale-the-minecraft-like-mmo-is-resurrected-by-its-creator-and-will-launch-soon-in-early-access.1356523/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Five months ago, Hypixel <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the studio was shutting down, which also meant the end of the long-awaited game project Hytale. Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> the developer and the project in April 2020 and reportedly requested a change in game engine, which caused numerous problems.</p>



<p>Now, however, Simon "Hypixel" Collins-Laflamme has surprised fans with the news that he has regained the rights from Riot Games and that Hytale will return to its original 'Legacy' engine and vision. The reason for that, according to Collins-Laflamme, is that the new 'Cross-platform' engine is significantly behind when it comes to gameplay features and would take at least two years to get to the same point as the original engine. This made the decision for the studio, which, however, still plans to make the Legacy engine cross-platform compatible at a later time, thus opening up compatibility beyond PC.</p>



<p>For now, Collins-Laflamme has already rehired over thirty developers from the Hypixel team, with more expected to return soon. The early access date will be announced soon and is likely to be relatively close, although the creator has warned that it will be a true early access release, with crashes, bugs, and broken features to be expected. It will be a long road to version 1.0, too, estimated to be 'at least a few years' away.</p>



<p>In its current state, Hytale already features over 100 NPCs and thousands of items and blocks, but many of these are not yet properly configured. The Adventure Mode won't be ready at the early access launch, and the same goes for the official minigames. The team is aware that these were an important part of the original Hytale vision, but the infrastructure and minigames are not yet ready. However, they have a dedicated team that will focus on implementing minigames once the core game is stable.  In the meantime, the community can start creating their own minigames, custom servers, and experiences. When the official minigames go live, their assets will also be shared, allowing the community to develop their own versions. </p>



<p>Indeed, Hytale will be all about modding from the very beginning. Collins-Flamme says it is possible to mod almost everything, both content and server-side, and claims that even non-developers can create impressive experiences with minimal technical knowledge. The development team promised to share server source code access within several months, allowing users to create their own custom servers, maps, adventures, and more.</p>
