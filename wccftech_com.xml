			<p>The <strong>Ubisoft Toronto</strong> team is at the helm of what is arguably one of <strong>Ubisoft's</strong> most significant projects, the long-awaited <strong>Splinter Cell Remake</strong>, and they're also the most recent team to get hit by the <strong>mass layoffs</strong> that Ubisoft has been conducting as part of its recently revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"> "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>."</a> This is Ubisoft's fourth layoff announcement in 2026.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft confirmed the layoffs to Wccftech in a statement that marked this layoff as part of a "<em>final phase</em>" of the company's global cost-saving efforts. The company also confirmed that development of the Splinter Cell Remake continues at the studio, alongside its work on <strong>Rainbow Six</strong> and its co-development projects.</p>



<p>Here's the full statement Ubisoft sent to Wccftech:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Following the&nbsp;recent&nbsp;announcement&nbsp;of the&nbsp;final phase of&nbsp;Ubisoft’s global cost-savings plan and the&nbsp;discontinuation&nbsp;of&nbsp;projects, Ubisoft Toronto will be <strong>reducing its workforce by 40 roles</strong>.</em> <em>This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected.&nbsp;Our priority now is to support&nbsp;them&nbsp;through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement&nbsp;assistance.&nbsp;The Toronto studio continues development on the Splinter Cell game and serves as a co-development partner on Rainbow Six, along with supporting additional co-development projects.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Splinter Cell Remake was first confirmed all the way back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/">December 2021</a>, after years of hopes and prayers from fans of the franchise that Ubisoft would one day return to it. While remakes always have the potential to make fans nervous since they're inherently always a bit of an attempt at recapturing lightning in a bottle, the ideal scenario where fans old and new get to enjoy a beloved game that also sparks development on new projects in that series is almost always too tempting to pass up.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-rewritten-updated-story/">But it's been years</a> since we've had any real update on the project's status, and despite rumours that the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/">aiming for a 2026 release</a>, the company's recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">organizational restructuring</a> and the fate of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/"> <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong></a> point to Splinter Cell fans having to wait a lot longer for some good Splinter Cell-related news.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this remake doesn't go the way of Sands of Time. The most recent significant update on the project arrived in December 2025, when it was spotted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-splinter-cell-remake-was-given-back-to-its-original-game-director/"><strong>David Grivel</strong> would be returning to the project as its game director</a>, after he initially left the role shortly after the project's reveal in 2021.</p>

			<p>Last week, we reported that the popular sci-fi action RPG looter-shooter <strong>Warframe</strong> would make its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-android-mobile-devices-launch-canada-first-digital-extremes/">worldwide debut on <strong>Android</strong> devices on <strong>February 18, 2026,</strong></a> after arriving first in Canada. That was, of course, true at the time. But a last-minute, one-day delay pushed the release back by, well, a day. So as of today, <strong>February 19, 2026,</strong> developer <strong>Digital Extreme's</strong> game is now officially out on Android mobile devices across the globe, and it still has another platform to hit, as it'll be coming to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>This new version of Warframe almost rounds out the full suite of available platforms, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now being the last major platform that you can't find Warframe on. That said, you can play it on Nintendo Switch; there's just no dedicated Switch 2 version yet.</p>



<p>"<em>To bring the Warframe experience to Android players has been a goal for quite some time in our efforts for total accessibility</em>," added <strong>Sheldon Carter</strong>, president of Digital Extremes, in a press release. "<em>This year is set to be a huge milestone for not only Warframe players, but our developers as well. The team is elated to welcome Android players to the full foid of cross-play platforms this year, including <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 soon</strong>. Warframe has become a gravitational force for gathering some of the kindest and most welcoming communities in gaming. Thanks to them, we've built an amusement park full of rides suited for any kind of taste; there's something for everyone to discover and enjoy here. It's going to be a big year, so come join us for the ride!</em>" </p>

<p>Players with Android devices that are running 64-bit Android on an ARM64 processor, Android OS 12.0 or higher, with a minimum of 4GB of RAM, will be able to jump into Warframe right away. Those players who download the game ahead of <strong>March 4, 2026,</strong> will also get the <strong>Cumulus Collection</strong>, which includes special weapon and armour cosmetics and resource boosters as part of their welcome to the game.</p>



<p>For more on Warframe, check out our interview with the legendary MMO designer <strong>Jack Emmert</strong>, and see why he points to Warframe as<a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-model-future-western-mmo-jack-emmert-greg-street/"> the model that all MMO developers should look to.</a></p>

			<p>For a good while now, the gaming industry has been grappling with the controversial integration of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">generative Artificial Intelligence</strong> in game development, with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more and more studios and publishers</strong></a> implementing it in a variety of ways. Other studios, however, are still keeping an eye on the technology, only using it as a tool to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ai-support-creativity-developers/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enhance the human touch</strong></a> that makes games special, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda Game Studios</em></strong> with its cautious, hands-off approach.</p>

While many fear that studios will eventually turn to automation for world-building and narrative, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Howard</strong> clearly stated that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</em></strong> is currently not using the technology to generate game assets or writing.</p>



<p><em>"We're being like incredibly cautious,"</em> <strong>Howard</strong> explained. <em>"Kind of viewing it as a tool, like an analyst. Look at the data in our games. We're not using it to generate anything. I think there's such an element of artistic intention that is essential to what we do and others do."</em></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Howard</strong> likened the development process to that of a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"craftsman,"</strong> arguing that the human touch is what ultimately makes a project special. However, he was highlighted the speed at which the technology is evolving, noting that the industry's stance on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">is frequently changing.</strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It's certainly not a fad,"</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Howard</strong> admitted. <em>"The AI answer now becomes 'ask me in six months.' It changes so much. You can't ignore it in terms of - it's coming, it's changing. Every few months there's a new model, particularly in the tech side with code or productivity."</em></p>



<p>According to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Howard</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda’s</em></strong> current interest in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI</strong> lies in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"big data"</strong> tasks, letting it handle the back-end busywork that traditionally takes a lot of time for actual developers to complete. By using <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI</strong> as an analyst, the studio hopes to clear away the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"boring"</strong> work so that developers can focus on what matters most: the creative tasks.</p>



<p><em>"We just have so much data in our games… using those systems to like help us with that or validate some things that we're thinking, I think has a lot of use today,"</em> <strong>Howard</strong> concluded.</p>
