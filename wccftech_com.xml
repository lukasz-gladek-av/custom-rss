			<p>Although very little is known about <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a></em></strong> other than that it is in the works and it is coming out at some point, the community is obviously excited about the next entry in the series. However, as it's already been almost 15 years since the launch of the celebrated <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, expectations are incredibly high, so much so that they have put the game in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, according to a former Bethesda employee.</p>



<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://esportsinsider.com/2026/01/nate-purkeypile-world-builder-skyrim-fallout-interview">Esports Insider</a></strong>, former <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda Lead Artist&nbsp;Nate Purkeypile</strong>,&nbsp;who worked on&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3,&nbsp;4,&nbsp;76,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Skyrim</em>, commented on the next entry in the series and the challenges it is already facing during development. Expectations for both the game and Fallout 5 (which is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/">unlikely to return to the series' roots</a></strong>, according to Fallout New Vegas lead developer Chris Avellone) are very high, and Purkeypile believes they have put both games in a <em>"no-win"</em> situation, alongside Skyrim being widely considered as one of the best games of all time.</p>



<p><em>"How do you beat that?"</em> he said. <em>"And I hope it’s a great game, but even if it’s just as good as Skyrim was, you’ll still get so many people throwing out hateful comments. I’m sure there will be more death threats again. All of that stuff. It’s really unfortunate that that’s the way things have gone,"</em> <strong>Purkeypile</strong> continued.</p>



<p>The massive fan expectations are putting major pressure on <strong><em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong>, and, according to <strong>Purkeypile</strong>, <strong>Bethesda</strong> will take all the time needed to deliver the best possible game. <em>"I think there is less economic pressure to just get Elder Scrolls VI out on a date, but there is more economic pressure to actually make sure it’s good, and I think that’s a good thing. That’s healthy so long as they’re also honest with the team about that,"</em> the former <strong>Bethesda</strong> lead artist elaborated.</p>



<p>The long time it's taking for the game to launch, however, has nothing to do with waiting to see <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a></em>'s</strong> reception. <em>"I’m sure there’s plenty of audience overlap and all, but just because one game flops doesn’t mean another will necessarily. There can be a whole bunch of reasons that happen."</em></p>



<p>Although a slightly different game, there's no denying that the reception <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em> received when it launched in 2023</strong></a>, which hasn't really improved over time with the release of free updates and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a></strong>, could definitely be putting more pressure on the development team to deliver the best possible RPG, and the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"ultimate fantasy simulator"</strong></a></em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard</strong> himself teased last year.</p>
