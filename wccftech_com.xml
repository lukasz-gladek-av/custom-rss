			<p>Yet another Microsoft studio has taken advantage of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">labour neutrality agreement the company signed with the CWA (Communications Workers of America)</a> to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard through, and this time it's DOOM developer id Software, with 165 developers at the Texas-based studio voting in favour of forming a wall-to-wall union.</p>



<p>Announced with <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-developers-texas-vote-form-latest-wall-wall-union-cwa">a press release from the CWA</a>, union members cited wanting to protect elements of their work, like being able to work remotely, ensuring "<em>responsible</em> <em>use of AI</em>," as lead services programmer at id Software and union member, Chris Hays, told <a href="https://aftermath.site/id-software-union-doom-microsoft-cwa/">Aftermath</a> in an interview.</p>



<p>"<em>The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives</em>," said id Software producer and union organizer Andrew Willis in a press release. "<em>The union is a way for us, the developers, to take back control of the industry we love and to ensure that it delivers high-quality products from high-quality workers who have health benefits and longevity beyond quarterly profits.</em>"</p>



<p>This past August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/450-diablo-developers-vote-in-favor-unionizing-cwa/">450 developers working on the Diablo series at Blizzard voted in favour</a> of forming a union with the CWA, and in May 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZeniMax Workers United QA were able to reach a tentative deal with Microsoft</a> to finally ratify their union contract after two years of negotiating.</p>



<p>"<em>Remote work isn't a perk,</em>" Hays added in the CWA press release. "<em>It's a necessity for our health, our families,</em> <em>and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being.</em> <em>With a union, we will have the opportunity to make sure that everyone has a voice in the things that matter most to us</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the developers at id Software have voted in favour of the union, they will have to go through the process of getting a contract agreement and then getting that agreement ratified. It took the ZeniMax Workers United QA union two years and a strike to get their contract done, which doesn't bode well for the other unions under Microsoft currently trying to get a contract agreed on and signed. But voting for the union is still a major step towards better working conditions for the developers.</p>



<p>Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has changed the video game industry in a myriad of ways, but perhaps one of the most significant ways will end up being how it allowed a labour movement within the video game industry to gain serious momentum. </p>



<p>"<em>I'm very proud to be a part of this effort to organize our studio, to have a voice in decisions that directly affect myself and my coworkers</em>," said organizing member and senior VFX artist at id Software, Caroline Pierrot. "<em>In an industry that has proven to be very unstable over the last few years, more unions means more power to the workers and a real shot at shaping the future of the industry for the better</em>."</p>

			<p>Marvel Rivals appearing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> might not have been the most surprising thing to happen at the show, but the reveal trailer NetEase Games brought with it matched the energy and the spectacle of the show appropriately, as it revealed that Deadpool would be joining the game's roster on January 16, 2026, with the launch of Season 6. Season 5.5, meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-adds-rogue-gambit-new-game-mode-new-map-and-more/">which adds Rogue to the roster after Gambit was added at the beginning of Season 5,</a> is available right now.</p>



<p>The cinematic trailer for Season 6 was one of the more animated trailers of the night, with Deadpool cracking jokes all the way through that fit his character, particularly all of his fourth-wall-breaking comments.</p>

<p>NetEase will reveal more details about Season 6: Night at the Museum and Deadpool closer to its arrival, though in the meantime, Season 5.5 is available right now for players to jump into, adding a new vanguard, the X-Men Rogue, to the roster.</p>



<p>Season 5.5 also sees the return of Jeff's Winter Splash Festival, this time with a new holiday-themed map,  Jeffland. It features a new three-way brawl and three unique Jeff builds that each have their own skill set. There are also plenty of winter and holiday-themed skins for players to grab to keep the holiday mood going through each match.</p>

<p>And, as is the case with every seasonal update, there's plenty of tweaks, balances, and bug fixes included in today's Season 5.5 release, with this batch including improvements to the spectactor system, new emotes, fixes for player stats that weren't registering properly, and more, all of which you can find in the patch notes with the big highlights mentioned in NetEase's Dev Vision video below.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> had more than a few big announcements, and it also saw the return of one of the industry's most notable indie developers, with Braid and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-witness-review-life-puzzle/">The Witness developer</a> Jonathan Blow and his team at Thekla, Inc., announcing their next project, Order of the Sinking Star. </p>



<p>It's a narrative puzzle game set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026 that Blow calls "<em>the biggest game I've worked on</em>," and a quick look at the trailer will make you understand why he describes it that way. It's a puzzle game on a scale you don't normally see, as you mash together different worlds and solve over a thousand puzzles crafted by Thekla Inc.</p>



<p>"<em>Order of the Sinking Star is the biggest game I've worked on, and also the most collaborative</em>," Blow said in a press release. "<em>It's a kind of game design supercollider that brings together ideas from many designers to create a puzzle landscape that's much more intricate and vast than what has come before." </em></p>



<p>"<em>We've successfully pushed the limits of what is possible in a puzzle adventure. The game is just incredibly complex and deep, and I can't wait to show more as we move toward launch in 2026.</em> <em>The game showcases design contributions from Alan Hazelden (A Monster's Expedition), Sean Barrett (Promesst), Jonah Ostroff (Heroes of Sokoban), Zach Polansky (Enigmash), Patrick Traynor (Patrick's Parabox), Marc ten Bosch (Miegakure), and several others</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Announcing Order of the Sinking Star is a major moment for us, for Jonathan and his team,</em>" added Yoon Im, chief executive officer of Arc Games, the publisher behind Order of the Sinking Star, in a press release. "<em>It represents an exciting year ahead for all of us. It's an honour to support Jonathan to make his most ambitious project yet a reality, as we believe Order of the Sinking Star is set to be the premier and innovative puzzle adventure of this generation. This announcement today marks just the beginning of what we have planned for a game-changing year for us next year.</em>" </p>



<p>While Order of the Sinking Star is currently only set to arrive on PC, it will likely come to other platforms as the press release mentions that "<em>additional platforms and release timing for the game will be revealed at a later date</em>." So expect Order of the Sinking Star to be available on other platforms beyond PC, it just might not arrive on consoles at the same time.</p>
