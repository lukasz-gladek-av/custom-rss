			<p>The next game in the BioShock series, which is currently referred to as BioShock 4, is reportedly having some major problems in development, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDA3NDMxNCwiZXhwIjoxNzU0Njc5MTE0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMEJXRTJHUTFZV1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Zt4Beo52NA1y9AxmXB4Bd38T64ITJqEG1fTMqnDAfZU">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> reports that it recently failed a check-in review with Take-Two and 2K leadership, which resulted in major changes being ordered to the game's narrative, and two of developer Cloud Chamber's creative leadership being removed from their roles into other areas of the company.</p>



<p>The report also reveals that a remake of the first BioShock game was in the works before it was "<em>shelved</em>" earlier this year, according to Bloomberg's sources.</p>







<p>Kelley Gilmore, studio head at Cloud Chamber, was removed from her role as studio head and moved into a position on the publishing side of things, as a result of BioShock 4 failing its recent review, and Hogarth de la Plante, creative director at Cloud Chamber, suffered the same fate, and is now in a publishing role. </p>



<p>2K reportedly told Cloud Chamber's staff that they need to be "<em>more agile and efficient,"</em> which Schreier adds now has staff concerned that layoffs are around the corner.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to Bloomberg in response to questions sent in regarding this report, 2K Games said, "<em>We are working hard to set </em><em>BioShock</em> up for the best possible future. <em>Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path</em>." The same spokesperson also confirmed the role changes for Gilmore and de la Plante.</p>



<p>BioShock 4 has reportedly been in development <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/">in some form or another since 2015</a>, or should we say at least since then, as Schreier adds that the game has been in development for "<em>more than a decade</em>," referring to his prior reporting that Certain Affinity had been working on the next BioShock game since at least 2015.</p>



<p>We only (<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-new-game-top-secret-2k-studio/">officially</a>) learned that BioShock 4 was coming in 2019, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/">Cloud Chamber announced as the studio helming the project</a>. In 2023, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/">claims that the game had been internally rebooted for a second time</a>, after suffering a reboot in 2018. Last year, we saw Cloud Chamber looking to ramp up development with <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/">multiple job listings posted</a>, and that was essentially the most recent sign of life we've seen from the studio on BioShock 4.</p>



<p>The lack of any concrete information on the game for more than a decade is as good a sign as any that it's struggling in development, because surely if it were anywhere near release, 2K and Take-Two would have already been shouting about it from rooftops. But today's report shows that Take-Two aren't convinced that BioShock 4 is where it needs to be yet.</p>



<p>Of course, there's a stark difference between what a great game looks like for bean-counting executives versus the developers actually working on it. There's more than a slight chance that this failure could be the result of Take-Two just not believing that the current path for BioShock 4 won't be the one that sells the most copies. That doesn't mean it isn't a great game in its current state.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's clear we'll have to continue waiting to see what happens with the next BioShock game. Hopefully, it'll be worth the wait.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fatekeeper Is a New First-Person Action RPG Inspired by Dark Messiah of Might and Magic]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fatekeeper-new-first-person-action-rpg-inspired-dark-messiah/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fatekeeper-is-a-new-first-person-action-rpg-inspired-by-dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic.1260213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025, the publisher announced a new dark fantasy game called Fatekeeper. This project is in development at a small studio in the German Alps, which is home to around ten former Spellforce III developers from Grimlore Games.</p>



<p>The idea behind the project came from a discussion about Hellraid, Techland's game, which seemed like it would finally follow in the footsteps of Arkane's classic Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. The developers felt (rightfully so, I might add) that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic was the first game to make first-person melee action combat feel really cool.</p>



<p>They were also disheartened when Hellraid turned out into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-hellraid-review-hellish-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small DLC pack for Dying Light</a> instead of the full-fledged standalone game that had originally been promised. Following that news, they decided to take matters into their own hands and create their own take on this oft-neglected genre. Thus, Fatekeeper was born, a title with modern graphics (it is powered by Unreal Engine 5), classic RPG elements, and first-person melee action combat.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Every item in the game can be inspected in the menu, and a lot of the items have hidden mechanics that are unlocked only after inspecting them properly. Following the inspiration of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Fatekeeper also allows for deep interactions with the environment, especially when using telekinesis on various objects and characters.</p>



<p>The developers are still working on the progression systems, such as the skill trees, so they haven't been shown yet. However, they promised progression would have considerable depth, like any other system in the game.</p>



<p>Fatekeeeper will be semi-linear. It's not an open world title, but the maps have been designed so that players can devise a lot of paths. While not as hard as a Souls game, this title should also provide plenty of challenge to players who seek that in games.</p>



<p>Frankly, it's about time that someone had such an idea and implemented it. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is long overdue for a spiritual successor, that's for sure.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gothic-1-remake-delayed-into-early-2026-demo-now-available-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s.1260204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic have confirmed a new release window for the Gothic 1 Remake, which was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166">previously</a> set to arrive before the end of 2025, will now launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S in early 2026. The delay is confirmed alongside the debut of a new gameplay trailer, and the release of a demo for the game finally coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>There's been a demo available for PC players to try out for months now, while console players have been left out of the loop. Now, PS5 and Xbox Series owners can try out the remake for themselves, ahead of its launch sometime in early next year.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019, with a surprise teaser demo to gauge players' interest. However, it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020</a> that players knew the remake would be happening for sure. </p>



<p>By the time it arrives in early 2026, it'll be nearly seven years from its announcement to its release, and it'll be nearly 20 years since the last time a new Gothic game was released. There's no indication yet that Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic are looking to make a brand new Gothic adventure, but if the coming remake is wildly successful, the chances of a new game in the series would greatly increase. </p>



<p>We'll find out sometime early next year if this remake has been worth the wait, and if there's any chance at more Gothic games in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside the new gameplay shown in today's showcase and the news of the demo hitting consoles, THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive also announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-classic-1-3-are-coming-to-playstation-and-xbox-in-2026/">original three Gothic games will be making their console debuts</a>, arriving on PlayStation and Xbox sometime in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Grimlore Games has Shadow Dropped Titan Quest II, Now Available in Early Access on PC]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grimlore-games-has-shadow-dropped-titan-quest-ii-now-available-in-early-access-on-pc.1260201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Grimlore Games confirmed that players anxious to jump into Titan Quest II would be able to do so with the game's early access launch set for sometime during the summer of 2025. Today, during its publisher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPVmpg6koqc">THQ Nordic's Digital Showcase</a> for 2025, the studio shadow-dropped Titan Quest II, and you can rush over to Steam or the Epic Games Store to play it right now.</p>



<p>The new trailer that debuted during today's showcase features plenty of the action-packed scenarios players will encounter in their mythological journey through Ancient Greece, and a few of the quieter moments, as it shows off the work that Grimlore Games has put into improving graphical fidelity and combat.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Titan Quest II was initially set to arrive sometime during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025</a>, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/">announced in May</a> that it would be delayed until sometime in the summer. Which makes today's news hit even harder as a pleasant surprise for players who were hoping to have already put in dozens of hours to Titan Quest II.</p>



<p>Especially the players who got to participate in playtests for the game earlier this year. Even though the decision to delay the game came from these same playtests, Grimlore Games said that "<em>over 92%"</em> of the players who participated in the demo playtest it hosted came away with a 'positive' or 'very positive' rating of the game.</p>



<p>Of course, it wouldn't have been delayed if not for the myriad of issues players called out, like combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balancing, so everyone jumping into the early access launch today will be sure to pay attention to how those aspects of the game have changed in the last few months. And then everything will surely be tweaked further, as it begins its early access journey and the back-and-forth between the studio and community feedback that'll shape the game's development.</p>



<p>When the 1.0 version of Titan Quest II launches, it'll be available for $49.99 / €49.99. The early access version, however, is available on all platforms for $29.99 / €29.99, and if you grab it anytime within its opening week, you'll get it for 20% less, at $23.99 / €23.99.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/weappy-studio-debuts-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-gameplay-no-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/weappy-studio-debuts-new-impressive-looking-gameplay-for-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-still-no-release-date.1260198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Eternal Life of Goldman is a new 2D action-platformer from Weappy Studio, and is easily one of the most impressive-looking 2D platformers on the market, thanks to everything being animated by hand. We just got another look at some more gameplay during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Digital Showcase</a> today, with the game looking arguably even better than it has before, with some new shots in a new trailer. The only downside, though, is that there's still no release date in sight.</p>



<p>While we didn't get any release date news, we did get a bit more of an insight into the story of the game, with the gameplay being shown while a mom and her son discuss Goldman, with the mom becoming more agitated as she divulges how Goldman spent his life pouring over maps, looking for some kind of ultimate treasure that consumed his every waking moment.</p>



<p>By the end of the trailer, she's yelling at her son as she's clearly angry for having followed Goldman in the first place, with the last few lines eerily delivered by the young boy, who doesn't completely understand why or how he's upset his mother, but is now clearly scared of her to some degree, as we're left watching Goldman descend into a dark chasm, and we're left wondering what happened to the boy.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Eternal Life of Goldman | Can Fairy Tales Hurt? | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHLIz4YxCJg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The manual animation style of The Eternal Life of Goldman calls back to games like Cuphead, which was also entirely animated by hand, and is regarded as one of the best 2D games in the past decade.</p>



<p>To be fair, Goldman still needs to stick the landing with its gameplay, Cuphead didn't win all its accolades based on looks alone. But if these trailers can be believed, 2D platforming fans will be in for a treat when The Eternal Life of Goldman launches. </p>



<p>Now if only we knew when it was launching.</p>
