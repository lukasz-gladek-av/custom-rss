			<p>After Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption developer Rockstar fired 30-40 employees, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was accused of union busting by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain</a>. Rockstar denied the accusations through a spokesperson and maintained that these employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had leaked information on a public forum</a>.</p>



<p>The latest chapter of the story saw an anonymous employee of the award-winning game development studio <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/?do=findComment&amp;comment=1072605777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write a lengthy post on GTAForums</a>, the biggest public forum dedicated to the series of best-selling open world videogames. This poster's identity was allegedly verified by a moderator at GTAForums.</p>



<p>In the post, this employee claims that the fired workers were practically ambushed by the HR department, which called them over 'for a quick chat' and then handed a termination letter accusing them of misconduct related to Discord discussions, but provided no evidence or further details about the supposed offense. Those physically present were reportedly forced out within minutes. Others who were not at the office received a brisk phone call of less than two minutes and were notified that they would receive the aforementioned letter. Some of them were sick, even recovering from surgery, or on family leave, and this sudden termination leaves them financially vulnerable.</p>



<p>The anonymous employee adds that Rockstar fired critical staff, such as leads, artists, designers, programmers, and producers, many of whom had long tenures and clean records at the studio. Moreover, he counters the official statement, clarifying that the Discord channel in question was strictly for employee and union discussions about working conditions, not for game leaks; all those who got terminated were union members. The timing, the employee says, was clearly aimed at sabotaging union recognition, just as the union group had reached the size needed to initiate formal negotiations for better pay and working conditions.</p>



<p>The post concludes with a warning that if Rockstar gets away with this, it may do it again without facing repercussions. The employee also urges fans to support the fired workers by making a donation <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the Action Network</a>.</p>



<p>The controversy arises in the same week that brought us to yesterday, when Rockstar announced the second delay of Grand Theft Auto VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now slated for release on November 19, 2026</a>.</p>

			<p>Thumper is an intense rhythm game loved by VR and non-VR fans alike, for its soundtrack, incredible lighting, and engaging gameplay. It's also nearly a decade old, but in the meantime, artist and composer behind Thumper, Brian Gibson, hasn't been sitting on his hands. Gibson, alongside Mike Mandel under their new developer label, Puddle, released a follow-up to Thumper titled Thrasher in July 2024.</p>



<p>The only problem with Thrasher is that when it arrived last July, it was only available as a VR title for Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro users. That's officially changed, however, with Thrasher making its Steam debut today, November 7, 2025. It's playable in PC VR, but non-VR users will be happy to know it is also playable as a regular-old flatscreen game.</p>

<iframe title="THRASHER Steam Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ilm63FtWc4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it's another cornucopia of lights and sounds blending to create what could be just as transcendent an audiovisual experience as Thumper before it. There's no indication yet if Thrasher will come to Xbox consoles as a flatscreen game and to PlayStation as a flatscreen and VR game with PS VR2, but with the bulk of the work done to make Thrasher work as a flatscreen game for PC, hopefully, those ports are on the horizon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, players on PC can jump into the 27 levels in Thrasher across its nine main stages and three game modes, and if you're already a fan of Gibson's work (and you have Thumper in your Steam library), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2702300/view/595164831678464806?l=english">then you're entitled to a special discount on Thrasher</a>. If not, then no need to fret as the game is also available at a 10% launch discount for a limited time.</p>



<p>If you're looking for more games like Thumper and Thrasher, then keep your eyes peeled for <a href="https://wccftech.com/lumines-arise-hands-on-sgf-2025-impressions/">Lumines Arise, which Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto got to preview at this year's Summer Game Fest</a>.</p>

			<p>The next entry in the Mass Effect series continues to be in development, BioWare confirmed today during the annual series' celebrations.</p>



<p>In a new blog post shared on the developer's <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">official website</a> for N7 Day 2025, Executive Producer Mike Gamble provided a brief update on the game, confirming that it continues to be in development, as EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in the series' universe.</p>



<p>Following some busy years at the studio, BioWare is now fully dedicated to the development of the next entry in the Mass Effect series, and is continuing to explore new features to build and figure out lots of romances.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show,"</em> Mike Gamble wrote, thanking players for their patience.</p>



<p>Besides providing this small update on the next entry in the series, the Mass Effect Executive Producer also provided an update on the TV show based on the series, which is i<a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">n the works by Amazon Prime Video</a>. The show, which will explore a brand-new story within the <span>universe's timeline, will be set after the original trilogy, and&nbsp;<em>"a lot has been figured out"</em>&nbsp;about how it fits with the series' canon and&nbsp;</span>the timeline of the next entry in the series.</p>



<p>The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/new-mass-effect-development/">next entry in the Mass Effect series was announced on November 7, 2020</a>, but very little has been said about it over the years, as BioWare was focused on the development of projects such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. As Mass Effect Andromeda ultimately proved to be a disappointing release for many fans in the series, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/">although it got gameplay right, in my opinion</a>, it makes sense for BioWare to take all the time it needs to make this comeback one to remember.</p>
