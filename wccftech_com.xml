			<p>Nintendo has announced today that The Legend of Zelda live-action movie will be released in theaters on March 26, 2027, roughly two years from today. The news was posted on Nintendo Today, the brand new app that was unveiled yesterday during the Nintendo Direct. According to the Big N, this smart device app is a daily calendar featuring the latest news, videos, and comics of Nintendo games and characters from select franchises. Nintendo Today is available on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-today/id6736725704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znsa&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>. Clearly, the delivery of such big news through the app is a way to emphasize its importance in Nintendo communications going forward.</p>
<p>The Zelda live action movie was <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> on November 8, 2023. Back then, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto said in a brief message to fans:</p>
<p><em>This is Miyamoto. I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega-hit films. I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.</em></p>
<p>Wes Ball, known for directing the Maze Runner trilogy and the upcoming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, will direct the film. Derek Connolly, who worked on the Jurassic World trilogy, Kong: Skull Island, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, and Star Wars: Episode IX—The Return of the Jedi, will write the script. The next step will obviously be to find the actors forming the cast. Fans are already wondering who will be cast in the key roles of Link and Zelda herself. Who would you like to see playing these hugely beloved characters? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			<p>Half-Life 2 RTX can be easily fixed to look much closer to the original game in terms of ambiance and atmosphere with some choice tweaks showcased in a recent video.</p>
<p>The video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2kliksphilip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2kliksphilip</a> highlights how volumetrics and light bounce impact the ambiance in the currently available demo of the RTX Remix project the most. The first is easily fixed by reducing the Max Accumulation Distance, which makes volumetrics update much faster once a light source has been covered, and the Froxel Max Distance settings, which, reduced to 0, completely eliminates fog and similar effects.</p>
<p>The other setting that was changed to make Half-Life 2 RTX look much closer to the original is the Max Expected Average Radiance, which was set to 0 to limit how much lighting bounces around. This creates a much darker atmosphere that's more in line with the limited light bounce the Source 1 engine was capable of.&nbsp; The amazing adjustability of RTX Remix has also allowed the modder to show how Ravenholm would look during the early morning by setting a negative value to fog distance.</p>

<p>Besides being an excellent showcase of how RTX Remix can significantly upgrade older games' visuals, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo is also an excellent showcase of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-showcase-sampler-feedback-vram/">Sampler Feedback technology</a>, which can be used to significantly lower VRAM usage, which can be a game-changer in the future for those playing games on GPUs with low VRAM.

According to user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1691278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiC</a>, based on the screen size of 7.9", the console dimensions should be around 201 x 115 x 14 mm.</p>

<p>While yesterday's Nintendo Direct wasn't supposed to reveal anything regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, we still learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-system-overhauls-digital-game-system-introducing-lending-of-digital-games-and-more/">Virtual Game Card system</a>, which will overhaul the original console's digital games system, will also be compatible with the upcoming system. The launch of the Nintendo Today app also brought the confirmation that the new button found on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-patent-mouse/">Joy-Con controller</a>&nbsp;is indeed called the C button, although its function still remains a mystery. Thankfully, it won't take long to finally know what this button will do, what the Nintendo Switch 2 is capable of, and which games will be available <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">at launch</a>, as the Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the system will air in five days, on April 2nd.</p>
