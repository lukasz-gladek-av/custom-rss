<p>No matter if you prefer linear intense experiences, super-hero games, stealth games, or immersive open-worlds to lose yourself in, you are sure to find some great games to play in the next 12 months.</p>



<p>Here are our <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">five most anticipated action games releasing in 202</strong>6.</p>

<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-september-9-2026-pc-playstation-5">Phantom Blade Zero (September 9, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5) </h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Phantom-Blade-Zero.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With its intense action combat and incredible animations, Phantom Blade 0 is looking like the best "pure" action game launching this year</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> made more than a few heads turn when it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/">revealed in May 2023</a>,</strong> with its distinctive style <strong>blending traditional kung fu with steampunk and cyberpunk</strong>. However, many dismissed it as yet another <strong>soulslike</strong>. Fortunately, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/">this won't be the case</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Edging closer to a more <strong>traditional action game</strong> than a soulslike, the game in development by S-Game is setting out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/"><strong>one of the best games of the current console generation</strong></a>, featuring intense action, linear yet articulate level design, exceptional enemy encounter design that forces players to employ every game mechanic effectively, epic boss battles and some of the smoothest animation in video games.</p>



<p>Though in the works by what is essentially an unproven team, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> truly has everything to <strong>succeed</strong> when <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-slashes-its-way-on-pc-and-playstation-5-this-september/"><strong>it launches this September.</strong></a></p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-q3-q4-2026-playstation-5">Marvel's Wolverine (Q3/Q4 2026 - PlayStation 5)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marvels-Wolverine.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Starring one of the most iconic Marvel Comics characters ever, Marvel's Wolverine is set to become one of the most successful action games of 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Marvel's Spider-Man</em> series</strong></a>, Insomniac Games is preparing to branch out with a new game starring <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the most beloved Marvel Comics characters</strong> that shares very little with Peter Parker's and Miles Morales' adventures.</p>



<p>Seemingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/"><strong>ditching the open-world</strong></a> of <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>, <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em> will take <strong>a third-person action adventure route</strong> where players control the legendary Logan, explore a variety of locations, meet an ensemble cast of Marvel Comics characters, and gruesomely take down enemies using his <strong>superior strength and Adamantium Claws</strong>. With the vehicle traversal and varied locations teased in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">last year's gameplay trailer</a></strong>, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about the game.</p>



<p>With <strong>Sony's first-party premier action-adventure game series not receiving new entries this year</strong>, <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em> is undoubtedly <strong>the game to look out for for fans of the genre</strong>, even those who aren't too keen on the Marvel Comics universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-crimson-desert-march-19-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">Crimson Desert (March 19, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Crimson-Desert-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Crimson Desert has been in development for a very long time, but 2026 is finally the year the game by Pearl Abyss finally sees the light of day</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Crimson Desert</em> by Pearl Abyss, the developers of the popular MMO Black Desert Online, has been in the works for a very long time, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/"><strong>this year we will finally be able to experience</strong></a> Kliff's journey through the continent of Pywel ourselves.</p>



<p>With the political turmoil following the death of the Unifier of Lands in the background, players will get to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">explore a really varied world</strong> with regions ranging from the pleasing plains of Akapen to the cold lands of Kweiden, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">raid castles</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">explore dungeons </strong>featuring puzzles, treasure and powerful enemies, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">create alliances</strong> with other central characters and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">master weapons and martial arts techniques</strong> to take down some <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gameplay-shows-off-boss-fight-against-mechanical-dragon/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rather impressive massive enemies</strong></a>.</p>



<p>For too long, <em>Crimson Desert</em> has been a huge unknown, but from what we have seen so far, the game has <strong>a high chance of being one of the best open-world action games </strong>in this packed 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-may-27-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2">007: First Light (May 27, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>

<p>With the massive success of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> (now available across three console generations) and <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>, it's no surprise that the gaming community is <strong>eagerly anticipating the game</strong>, despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/"><strong>limited information available today.</strong></a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Project Blackbird Was the Game I Had Waited My Entire Career to Create, and Having it Canceled Led to my Resignation’, Confirms Ex ZOS Founder]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After several months of complete silence, former <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> founder and studio head <strong>Matt Firor</strong> (an industry veteran known mainly for Mythic's Dark Age of Camelot and, of course, The Elder Scrolls Online) confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a> directly led to his resignation from the company. In a post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on LinkedIn</a>, he also revealed he's not involved in any of the new game projects that have been kicked off by former ZeniMax Online Studios who were laid off as part of the abrupt cancellation of Project Blackbird. </p>



<p><em>Right off the top - and to answer the most comment question I get - I am not directly involved in any of the projects that have been spun up by former members of the ZOS team. I am advising some of them informally, but I am not leading them. They are in good hands with their respective leaders and I can't wait to see what they come up with.</em></p>



<p><em>Answering the second-most common question - about what led my leaving ZOS - the most obvious explanation is the correct one. Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation. My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.</em></p>



<p><em>I cannot express deeply enough my respect and thanks for both the Elder Scrolls Online development team and the players that together comprise the most welcoming, best community in online gaming. I have successfully moved from the first group to the second, and now enjoy the game as an anonymous community member, and it is refreshing and fun. Long may both groups prosper!</em></p>



<p>Project Blackbird had been in development for over seven years at that point. In November 2022, Creative Director <strong>Ben Jones</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the project was based on a new intellectual property and that ZeniMax Online had already assigned around 200 developers to it.</p>



<p>Its cancellation came as part of the latest round of <strong>Microsoft</strong>-mandated layoffs, with the company making cuts <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to fund its AI investments</a></strong>. The news became even more disappointing upon learning that the project was actually morphing into a promising game. The Lead Graphics Programmer, <strong>Alex Tardif</strong>, quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed that out in a public statement</a>, and other reports independently confirmed his assessment. <strong>Bloomberg</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> had enjoyed a playtest in March so much that the controller had to be literally pried from his hands. The reporter, <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, watched a video of the vertical slice and was himself impressed.</p>



<p>Later, <strong>TrueAchievements</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that Project Blackbird was an online third-person sci-fi shooter/action game set on Soteria, a tidally locked exoplanet with three distinct environmental zones: a frozen ice side, a scorched sun-facing side, and a habitable middle region called The Twilight Band. Players would have assumed the role of Revenants, operatives working for various alien syndicates operating across the planet. Missions were cooperative, supporting 4 to 6 players per operation, depending on the scale of the mission. Players earned contracts from the various syndicates they pledged loyalty to, building rank and reputation. The whole game had a sci-fi noir vibe, which sounded very intriguing.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we'll never get to play it. Hopefully, we will eventually get to play the new game in development at <strong>Sackbird Studios</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a team founded by some of the Project Blackbird developers after they were laid off</a>.</p>
