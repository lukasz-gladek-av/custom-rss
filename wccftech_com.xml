			<p>Despite dropping the mandatory PlayStation Network account sign in for single-player games on PC, looking at Lost Soul Aside, it looks like any single-player game published on PC by Playstation Publishing could still be blocked in unsupported countries.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-region-blocked-in-130-countries.1113747/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1235001/info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Database </a>currently shows that the upcoming game developed by Ultizero Games will not be available for purchase in the 130 countries where the PlayStation Network is not available, despite mandatory account log-in having been dropped from the game as it was for other single player only games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-account-requirements-on-pc-dropped-for-spider-man-2-the-last-of-us-part-ii-and-two-more-games/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part II Remastered and God of War Ragnarok</a>. Hopefully, this is just a leftover of the mandatory account login that has now been removed and will be rectified before launch.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside has been in development for a very long time, but its release is finally right around the corner<span>. It will launch, as confirmed during the latest PlayStation State of Play, which aired last week on<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;May 30th</a>. As mentioned above, the game originally required a&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Network account sign in</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/">&nbsp;to play</a>, but now users in countries supported by the PlayStation Network won't require an account to play the game on Steam.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software beta update is now available for users invited to test it out before the public release, introducing new Activities improvements, and more.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-software-beta-feb-25.1114107/">ResetERA forums</a>, the new firmware update introduces new Activity improvements that make it easier for users to view details by fully displaying them on the card itself while still keeping spoilers hidden. The update also introduces support for Unicode 16.0 emojis, some Parental Control changes, improved system software performance and stability, and enhanced message usability on some screens. So, all in all, this looks like a minor update, although more features and improvements could be added before the update goes live for all users.</p>
<p>Activities, in particular, have been receiving some attention in recent PlayStation 5 system software updates, as the latest update, update <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-07-10-20-00-performance-improvements/">24.07-10.20.00</a>, made it so that each activity will display its current status. Besides improving specific features and enhancing firmware performance and stability, the latest updates have been pretty light since the latest major update, 24.06, which introduced the Welcome Hub, new Remote Play improvements, new personalized 3D audio profiles, and more. Everything that was introduced in the latest major PlayStation 5 system software update can be found in detail <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/">here.</a></p>
