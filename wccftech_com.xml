			<p>The <strong>GDC Awards</strong>, similar to the<a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"> <strong>DICE Awards</strong></a>, are an awards show voted on entirely by game developers and industry professionals. Also similar to the DICE Awards, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">every other major</a> video game-related <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">awards show for that matter</a>, is the fact that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></strong> leads the pack with the most nominations, including a nomination for <strong>Game of the Year</strong>.</p>



<p>In fact, Clair Obscur is nominated in almost every single category included in the GDC Awards. To be fair, it's not a grand list of 20+ categories; there are only <strong>nine</strong> categories included in the GDC Awards. That said, Clair Obscur has been nominated in eight of those nine categories, which is still impressive, and a sign of just how much respect and adoration people inside the industry have for the game.</p>



<p>Out of the nine categories, the only nomination Clair Obscur is missing is a nod in the Social Impact category. As for other games that got multiple nominations, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Ghost of Yōtei</a></strong> runs just behind Clair Obscur with five nominations, while <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong> all have four nominations. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></strong> and <strong>Dispatch</strong> both walked away with three nominations.</p>



<p>What is different about the GDC Awards compared to other shows is that it lists Honourable Mentions for each category alongside the nominees. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> didn't receive a single nomination, but it did get three honourable mentions. </p>



<p>The GDC Awards will take place on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> and will be the day after the IGF Awards, unlike previous years, where both shows would take place on the same day during GDC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of nominees, and the honourable mentions for each category:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Remote Work Is Part of the Reason for Recent Game Delays’, Says Ex Tripwire CEO: ‘People Are Often Less Efficient and Creative at Home’]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ex-tripwire-ceo-remote-work-game-delays/</link>
            <guid>1407616</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the second chapter of my report from the long chat I had with former <strong>Tripwire Interactive</strong> CEO <strong>John Gibson</strong>, the owner and founder of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Templar Media</a></strong> shared his opinion on the recent game delays and industry-wide layoffs. Both were, in essence, caused by COVID-19: the pandemic practically cracked the door wide open for remote work, which Gibson believes makes people less efficient and creative, and also sparked a massive hiring spree and inflated salaries, which are only now being readjusted. <span>Regarding game delays, Gibson specifically mentioned&nbsp;<strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>, which he said took <strong>5 years to make</strong> (and received</span> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-3-review/">a mixed reception when it launched last July</a>).</p>



<p><em>The industry faced a "video game apocalypse" in 2023 and 2024 as things collapsed following the pandemic boom. Games were not always of high quality or were taking much longer to develop. For instance, the sequel to Killing Floor 2 took five years to make. I believe part of the reason for these game delays is remote work. While working from home feels great, people are often less efficient and less creative. Some of the greatest ideas in the games I have worked on came from random encounters in the hallway. Two people might have different parts of a great idea, chat in the hallway, and create a whole concept for the game. As part of this acquisition, the core team on Gate Zero is relocating to our offices in Georgia. Having everyone in the office will allow us to iterate quickly to finish the game. This business decision will result in a more entertaining and fun game for the player.</em></p>



<p><em>Another challenge was overinflated salaries during the pandemic. Companies with high COVID-era profits were overpaying for talent. For instance, an engineer might be offered a million dollars for their first year. This was unsustainable, and many of those companies eventually conducted massive layoffs. There is now a reset occurring where people must readjust their salary expectations to fair, sustainable levels.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, in the first chapter, the ex co-founder and CEO of Tripwire shared his '<strong>Entertainment First</strong>' vision for games (and movies and TV) that <strong>focus on fun instead of any specific agendas</strong>. In the full interview, you'll also learn a lot more about <strong>Gate Zero</strong>, the upcoming game based on the <strong>Bible</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie’s Latest Marathon Deep Dive Shows Off the Seven Runner Shells Classes, New Gameplay Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>1407613</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie</strong> has debuted its latest deep dive into <strong>Marathon</strong> with a new 'Developer Insights' video, which details all seven of the different Runner Shells, which essentially act as the classes that players will be able to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills and strengths for different playstyles.</p>



<p>The seven different Runner Shells include six that could be considered the 'main' classes players can choose from, which are: Destroyer, Assassin, Recon, Vandal, Thief, and Triage. The seventh shell, Rook, is a solo-queue-only class that lets you jump into ongoing matches, grab a bit of loot, and get out with a free loadout you don't risk at all. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev-insights-runner-shells-new-video">A blog post shared alongside the video</a> also digs into the difference between <strong>Cores </strong>and <strong>Implants</strong>. Both are mechanics that give you a boost in the middle of a match, with the difference being that Implants can be used by any Shell, whereas to use a Core, you'll have to find the Core that is made to be used with your specific Runner Shell.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon Developer Insights | Runner Shells" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFzR8bN13FA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It also digs into the buildcrafting you can do with the different Runner Shells, and how you can push each of their abilities further by leaning into different cores and implants. "<em>For example, with Vandal you can lean into a mobility build, with powerful map traversal and repositioning. Equip cores that turn your double jump into a triple jump, and implants that increase your base movement speed, jump height, and improve your heat capacity</em>," the blog post reads.</p>



<p>One thing not included in today's video is a release date or even a release window, as to when we can expect to see Marathon on shelves. Hopefully, we'll have that information sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>To say that Marathon has had a troubled development would be an understatement. The game's original <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">director was fired on misconduct allegations</a>, Bungie has suffe<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/">red several layoffs during its development</a>, press around the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/">has been consistently negative with rumors of internal issues</a>, and it went through <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">a massive plagiarism scandal</a> that only <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed the game further</a>.</p>



<p>Today's gameplay of the seven Runner Shells is honestly the best the game has ever looked, as it actually seems to be taking the shape of the kind of extraction-hero-shooter it's going for. Hopefully, it'll be able to stick the landing when it does arrive. If Bungie doesn't get a clear-cut win soon, it may be in for some even more dark days.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Puts the Nail in the Coffin: New World Aeternum Delisted Today, Will Go Offline January 2027]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-delisted-go-offline-january-2027-amazon-game-studios/</link>
            <guid>1407529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After <strong>Amazon</strong> killed <strong>New World Aeternum</strong> by <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">cancelling new content for it, just as players were starting to return to the game</a>, it began putting the nails in New World's coffin today. First, by suddenly <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/">delisting the game</a></strong> as of today, <strong>January 15, 2026</strong>. Second, by announcing that the game will go <strong>offline on January 31, 2027.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">A blog post on the official New World website</a> begins explaining the news by saying it wanted to "<em>provide transparency on where the game goes from here.</em>" Which, essentially, is nowhere. "<em></em><em>New World: Aeternum</em> will officially be taken offline from all platforms on January 31, 2027," reads the next line. </p>



<p>If you already have the game in your Steam library, then you'll still be able to play it for the remainder of this year, which Amazon previously promised would be the case. After December 31, 2026, though, you'll only have one more month to enjoy the MMORPG. If you don't have it in your library, then you've already missed your chance to grab it, as the purchase option has already been removed from the store page.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can still purchase microtransactions, if you want, until <strong>July 20, 2026</strong>; however, Amazon Game Studios has made it clear that <strong>refunds will not be available</strong> for Marks of Fortune microtransaction purchases. Amazon Game Studios will also still monitor the servers and release bug fixes for the remainder of the game's life.</p>



<p>New content for New World was shut down after Amazon Game Studios was hit with "<em>significant</em>" layoffs as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">Amazon's mass <strong>14,000+ company-wide</strong> layoff last year</a>. After the studio was clear that it wouldn't be making new content for New World, it was clear that the game would be shut down at some point, so this news isn't exactly surprising.</p>



<p>It is, however, still disappointing. Amazon had succeeded where others failed by being a major company not previously involved in video games, which entered the industry and actually knocked it out of the park with a successful internally-built game. New World was putting up <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-has-hit-100000-concurrent-players-regularly-since-launch-of-fresh-start-servers/">huge player numbers</a></strong>, and while it had previously fallen into a bit of a low period, just prior to the announcement that no more new content would be developed for it, players were starting to really return to the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion</em>," the blog post from Amazon Game Studios reads. "<em>We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It has been our pleasure to work on </em><em>New World: Aeternum</em> and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."</p>
