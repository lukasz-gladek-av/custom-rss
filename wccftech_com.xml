			<p>Today, The Chinese Room has <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-the-cast-of-mortals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 developer diary dedicated to the game's mortal non-player characters (NPCs). As the World of Darkness Head of Creative Management Karim Muammar puts it, vampires can only be striking if they have a mortal backdrop.&nbsp;Bloodlines 2 will feature several human NPCs who are, however, either knowingly or unknowingly, still entangled with the vampires of Seattle.</p>
<p>For example, Pandora Graves is a young girl that protagonist Phyre will meet in a bar. She knows quite a bit about the Kindred, and yet doesn't appear to realize the danger she's in by putting herself so close to vampires. Then there's Verona De Lancey, the offspring of wealthy parents who decided to come to the big city to search for more excitement. Apparently, she got more than she bargained for, having received a death threat in her handbag after a single night in Seattle.</p>
<p>Dale Beecher, on the other hand, is aware that Kindred society exists but only occasionally crosses paths with them, even though, from the description, he sounds like some kind of alchemist vendor. Biker Guru says he's able to sense ghosts, but seems unfazed by that fact. He can usually be found close to the rest of his biker friends near The Dutchman bar.</p>

<p>Carla was a dedicated paramedic, but she parted ways with her employers after something went wrong in their work relationship. However, she still looks out for the people of Seattle, dispensing medicine on the city's streets. Then there's Reggie, a bum with a philosophical view of the city, how it works, and where he can make a difference. He haunts Pioneer Square and usually has a good idea of what's going on in the streets nearby.</p>
<p>Marigold is a familiar figure on the streets near Atrium. She's been conducting her trade with passers-by for a long time and now also offers fortune-telling through astrology. Shelby was a trader in a major financial organization until six months ago when she received a revelation. Now, she walks the streets of uptown Seattle, making sure everyone is well aware of the coming rapture, although, according to her, there's nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Wheeler is a trustworthy officer of the Seattle Police Department. However, he has problems with his memory from time to time and is aware that things aren't quite the way they should be. Lastly, Mr. Lemon is a drunkard who has been in the Seattle Police Department's drunk-tank for a few days now and still hasnâ€™t sobered up.</p>

<p>According to The Chinese Room, players will influence the lives of all these mortal NPCs (and more) in one way or another when going through Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The next developer diary is scheduled in two weeks and will focus on Hunters. The game is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch this year</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>Sonic Rumble is a new party game from Sega inspired by the highly popular party game Fall Guys. The title was originally meant to launch at the end of 2024, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. This news was announced in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> by Sega, where they went on to tease some of the features that people can expect to see in the game. Sega also went on to say:</p>
<p><em>We would like to extend a huge thank you to our players and Sonic fans for their patience in waiting for the global launch of Sonic Rumble. The team is committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans with even more new game mechanics, new features, and more exciting content to look forward</em> to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Rumble - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em6-SjjaYQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the game doesn't have a set release date yet, Sega has confirmed that the game will be coming in Spring, and even included a roadmap for the game within the blog post.</p>
<p>Sonic Rumble was already available to some degree in a pre-launch early-access period, where players would get to experiment with a limited amount of features. With the game's full global launch coming in Spring 2025, this will take the game to 1.2.0, where a competitive game mode will be added, as well as a feature called "Crew," which will allow players to team up together and play Sonic rumble.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to dedicate a significant amount of time to the game, a game mode named Quick Rumble will also be available for players at launch. Instead of a full-scale match, this instead provides matches that last one round and is perfect for those players out there who may not like long play sessions or those who don't have much time to spare.</p>
<p>In addition to the three features, Sega also spoke about how it is making Sonic Rumble "truly unique."</p>
<p><em>We're making Sonic Rumble truly unique by embracing the abilities of your favorite characters from across Sonic's universe. Ever wanted to stun rivals with Amy's Piko Piko Hammer? Now you can!</em></p>
<p>Selected characters will have a certain set of unique abilities that will give those who play them the potential to get an advantage by utilizing the abilities and help keep the gameplay fresh.</p>
<p>When Sonic Rumble does release, it will be available on iOS and Android, as well as on PC via Steam. It's not certain yet whether there are plans to bring this game to console or whether the next big release on console will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a> first, which is set to release later this year on console and PC.</p>

			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 dock has arrived today, thanks to some new pictures shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2dH7Za0#n35dYx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new pictures</a>, which have been shared online by the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4119">Famiiboards forums</a>, provide a new look at the console's dock, highlighting some of the changes over the current dock, including what looks like a grid on the base of the dock, which suggests a change in the cooling and air intake over the current model.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-awaited reveal last month, Nintendo has kept pretty silent about its new system and will likely continue to do so until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>. According to a former Nintendo employee, the event won't only go over the Nintendo Switch 2 features that were briefly teased in the reveal trailer, but will also likely confirm the console's release date, which is speculated to be sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">June</a> for a few reasons, so there's the chance that we won't have to wait much longer to learn when it will finally launch worldwide.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches this year. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
