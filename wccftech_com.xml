			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> is due to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on August 8, 2025, and in the lead up to its launch, developer Hangar 13 is doing everything it can to showcase how improved this prequel entry to the series is since we last checked in with the Mafia franchise.</p>
<p>The latest of those efforts is a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwkvXUiG8do">developer diary video</a>, "<em>Art Meets Technology,</em>" which digs into how much better looking Mafia: The Old Country is compared to the rest of the series thanks to the new technologies available in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"<em>It allows us to tell that story in a way that we just wouldn't be able to, with other technologies,</em>" said art director Steve Noake. He continued, "<em>F</em><em>rom Metahuman, to Nanite, to Lumen. These are all different technologies which we are pushing to the max, to be honest. It's allowing us to grasp the intricacies of a performance, it's allowing us to automate some parts of the process, to be able to get to a point where we can really start to put our human thumbprints on some of these assets.</em>"</p>

<p>Lead character artist Ivan Rylka added that there's a "<em>notable improvement</em>" in what's possible with Unreal Engine 5 versus what Hangar 13 was capable of doing prior to UE5, and confidently claimed "<em>I have no hesitation that this will be the best looking Mafia game in the franchise.</em>"</p>
<p>It's clear that Hangar 13 is putting in every effort to make Mafia: The Old Country look and feel as good as possible. It'll be interesting to see if it's more than just looks by the time it arrives this coming August.</p>

			<p>SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">announced</a> that it has reached a tentative deal with video game companies over the Interactive Media contract, potentially bringing the voice actors' strike to an end.</p>
<p>Performers under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">on strike since July 2024</a>, with the main sticking point being protections from companies abusing generative AI technology to use an actor's voice in perpetuity, without having to compensate them after the first contract agreement, or get consent from the actor to use an AI-generated version of their voice for future projects.</p>
<p>Now, a tentative deal has been reached, which SAG-AFTRA's national chief executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, says "<em>puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains.</em>"</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher added, "<em>Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game.</em>"</p>
<p>Once the details of the deal have been finalized, which is expected to happen "<em>soon</em>," the strike will end<em>. </em>Performers under the IMA are still on strike until such time.</p>
