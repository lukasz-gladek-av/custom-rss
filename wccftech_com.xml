			<p>At the time of this writing, The Game Awards is only ten days away, which means that we're getting close to the end of 2025 and that we're potentially days away from seeing the biggest reveals for the video game industry in 2025. The nominees for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">almost every category were already announced</a>, save for the only category that is decided entirely by public vote: the Player's Voice Award.</p>



<p>The Player's Choice Award is decided over three rounds of voting, and the first round <a href="https://thegameawards.com/brackets/players-voice">was pushed live to The Game Awards website today</a> for players to check out and vote on. It starts with 30 games, of which players can pick their favourite 10 to potentially move into the next round.</p>



<p>You can head to the website to select your preferred 10 now, and it's recommended that you do so sooner than later if you want your vote to count in each round, since the voting for round one will end as of Tuesday, December 2, at 6pm PT / 9pm ET. </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, all six games nominated for Game of the Year made the cut for the Players' Voice. In fact, most of the 30 games are nominated in at least one other category for this year's Game Awards. There are, however, a couple of games that aren't nominated anywhere else save for Players' Voice, including Delta Force, Genshin Impact, Warframe, and REPO.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of the 30 games nominated for Players' Voice here:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Embracer Group <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/">shed two more companies it had scooped up during its acquisition spree</a> that led to a major collapse when <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/">a massive $2 billion deal fell through</a>, and the company was unable to recover. This time, it was Remnant II publisher Arc Games and developer Cryptic Studios who were able to escape Embracer Group before the company shut them down, as it did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/">Volition Games</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/timesplitters-fans-have-their-hopes-crushed-once-again-by-new-closure-of-developer-free-radical-design/">Free Radical Design</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Arc Games is the newest independent publisher of double-A games on the block, thanks to a successful buyout from Embracer with the help of XD Inc., which provided financing support to make the buyout possible.</p>



<p>The publisher's current organizational structure will remain the same during the transition, and the company will not be laying off any members of its team. It's the ideal scenario where Arc Games doesn't collapse under a larger parent company that made some pretty callous decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>This milestone marks a major new chapter for Arc Games</em>," said chief executive officer Yoon Im, in a press release. "<em>We appreciate our time being a part of Embracer Group and the accomplishments achieved since the company's inception over 15 years ago. These</em> <em>experiences have shaped who we are today. As an independent publisher,</em> <em>we are now positioned to more fully pursue our vision - collaborating with exceptional developers worldwide and bringing standout games to market. 2026 is already shaping up to be one of the most ambitious and innovative years in our history, and we are excited for what lies ahead</em>."</p>



<p>Along with publishing both Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant II, Arc Games is also known for publishing the Torchlight series, Star Trek Online, Neverwinter, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-gets-slight-delay-early-access-debut-avoid-battlefield-6/">recently released Fellowship</a>. It has also published titles like Have A Nice Death and Hyper Light Breaker.</p>

			<p>Rockstar co-founder and one of the most instrumental creatives behind series like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, Dan Houser, has had a lot to say about generative AI lately. As Houser continues to participate in interviews as part of promoting his new book, <a href="https://wccftech.com/american-caper-a-better-paradise-gta-creator-dan-houser-absurd-ventures/">A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath</a>, his latest comments on generative AI are not aimed at the technology itself, but at the people pushing for its use in all situations.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VirginRadioUK/videos/851083790630384/">The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on Virgin Radio UK</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gta-writer-dan-houser-says-the-people-leading-the-push-for-ai-are-not-the-most-humane-or-creative-people/">VGC</a>), when Houser was asked about generative AI, he agreed that it would never be able to replace human creativity, as he's said before, and further added, "<em>Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI are not the most humane or creative people</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>They're sort of saying, 'we're better at being human than you are,' and it's obviously not true. One of the other things we're trying to capture is that humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people who maybe aren't fully rounded humans.</em>"</p>



<p>Evans followed up by asking if Houser believes that generative AI, in its current state and in the future, will be the massive success that executives who are pushing for its use believe it will be. "<em>As far as I understand it, I personally don't think it will</em>," Houser began. </p>



<p>"<em>Because I think AI is eventually going to eat itself, because as I understand it - which is really a superficial understanding - the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models, so it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease. I can't see how the information gets better if they're already running out of data. It will do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly."</em></p>



<p>Recently, Houser said that <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creator-reveals-favorite-character-says-llms-will-be-good-at-cheap-stuff-not-magic/">he's "<em></em><em>less scared than a lot of people</em>," with regard to the question of generative AI technology replacing humans</a>, particularly in creative roles. "<em>I think you're going to end up with a lot of work that looks the same. It's going to help people be creative in some ways. It's going to get some people who probably shouldn't be in that space out of that space. But if you've got talent, I think it'll be fine. I don't think they're going to come up with magic. I think they're going to be fantastic at coming up with really cheap, decent stuff.</em>"</p>
