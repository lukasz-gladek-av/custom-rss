			<p>As far as triple-A-ish games go, <strong>Highguard</strong> might go down in history as one of the games that spent the least time in the spotlight, and even when it did, it was all for the wrong reasons.</p>



<p>The game <strong>was a complete secret</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until The Game Awards 2025</a>. The CEO of game developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, <strong>Dusty Welch, </strong>would later reveal that their original goal was to <strong>shadowdrop the game</strong> in late January, much as <strong>Respawn's Apex Legends</strong> did back in 2019 (on which several members of the team had worked). However, when <strong>Geoff Keighley</strong> suddenly came to Wildlight with the offer to close out The Game Awards ceremony with a Highguard trailer, Welch felt it would have been foolish to refuse.</p>



<p>As they say, <strong>hindsight is 20/20</strong>, but there's no doubt that <strong>that unveiling has backfired majorly</strong>. Viewers wanted to see a big new <span>single-player game as the show's closing announcement, not another hero shooter, and&nbsp;<strong>immediately criticized both Keighley and Highguard itself</strong>, setting the stage for&nbsp;</span>negative sentiment that hit the game like a hammer.</p>



<p>Rather than delaying the game and perhaps trying to address some of the early complaints, Wildlight <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still launched Highguard as planned</a></strong> in late January. Unsurprisingly, the Steam page <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly filled with negative reviews</a></strong>, just as Dusty Welch had admitted the trailer didn't showcase their game well.</p>



<p>Last week, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that Wildlight <strong>had already been forced to lay off most of the team</strong>, following the game's terrible launch. A few days ago, one of the developers who was laid off <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized players</a> for failing to give Highguard a chance</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, <strong>the game appears to be on its deathbed</strong>. The 24-hour concurrent player peak on Steam was just 1,507 players, and the <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> has been down for several hours. Those few players who actually enjoy the game are worried its closure might be announced at any moment. Meanwhile, Stephen Totilo has <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Chinese giant <strong>Tencent</strong>, one of the biggest gaming publishers, was the secret investor behind the game. </p>



<p>What do you think of Highguard and its seemingly brief life? Did it deserve more or not? Let us know in the poll and comments.</p>

			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">PC gaming</strong> has been in a rough spot in the past few years, with too many games launching with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">technical and optimization issues</strong> that are left unresolved. However, there are times when a game's optimization is judged based on a game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra settings</strong>, which creates a situation where developers—such as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-proud-nordics-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-nintendo-switch/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a></em></strong> <strong>PC</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS5,</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> version developer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PH3's Peter "Durante" Thoman</strong>—have to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"protect players from themselves"</em> and balance optimization with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proofing</strong> their games.</p>



<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19632-ys-x-proud-nordics-durante-interview-ph3-switch-2-dlss-ps5-pro-switch-1-trails-beyond-the-horizon-port-challenges-tea-2026-exclusive">RPGFan</a></em></strong>, the legendary developer, who some may remember for fixing the flawed PC port of the original <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dark Souls</em></strong> with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19">DSFix</a></strong>, was asked for clarification about the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"protecting players from themselves"</em> statement made when talking about the PC port of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Trails beyond the Horizon</em></strong> regarding some players cranking up the settings to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra</strong> and complain about optimization.</p>



<p><em>"I don’t think it’s 'a lot' of players, but this does happen. And it is very annoying – not (just) because it’s our work, but because it’s genuinely <strong>counter-productive</strong>,"</em> Durante said. <em>"We try very hard to implement a huge amount of settings in order to make our <strong>PC versions scale</strong> from low-power devices like the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> all the way to an RGB-riddled gaming rig with a <strong>500 Watt monster GPU</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Not many PC ports offer this level of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">scalability</strong> nowadays, <span>which creates a critical issue, according to the&nbsp;<em><strong>developer of the Ys X: Proud Nordics</strong></em>&nbsp;port</span>. </p>



<p><em>"That’s the crux: as a developer, we get to decide what e.g. <strong>'Ultra'</strong> means. And people judging the <strong>'optimization'</strong> of a game based on how it runs at <strong>'Ultra' settings</strong> creates <strong>perverse incentives</strong> for this,"</em> Durante said. <em>"Taking this to its logical conclusion, if we were to remove the <strong>'Ultra' settings</strong>, rename <strong>'Very High' to 'Ultra'</strong>, and make no other changes, then this metric would say that our game is now much more <strong>'optimized'</strong>."</em></p>



<p>With this widespread misperception, it's not easy for any developer to offer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">highly scalable settings</strong> that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proof</strong> games. However, there's plenty of value in doing so. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"As a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC gaming enthusiast</strong> for over 20 years now, going back to older games with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new hardware</strong> and seeing them in a new light is something I greatly enjoy – and disincentivizing developers from adding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">high-end options</strong> goes directly against that,"</em> Durante concluded.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Durante’s stance</strong> is a call for a more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">nuanced understanding</strong> of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC and console performance</strong>, which seems to have been lost in the past few generations. By refusing to cap a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC port's settings</strong> to its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">console equivalent</strong>, or only slightly beyond it, developers would prioritize the platform's greatest asset: its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">longevity</strong>. </p>



<p>I’ve experienced this firsthand when <strong>revisiting older</strong> titles like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</em>. Seeing it <strong>scale to modern resolutions and framerates</strong> years later is what makes PC gaming unique. If CD Projekt Red had <strong>capped those settings back then to match the hardware of the time</strong>, I would have never experienced the game in the new light Durante mentioned.</p>



<p>Hopefully, more developers will offer more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">future-proof Ultra settings</strong>, although with the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remasters</strong> consistently getting announced, I don't personally believe this will happen anytime soon.</p>

			<p><strong>Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape</strong> is a new large scale mod project that aims to <strong>restore content cut by CAPCOM</strong> from the original game while also <strong>adding several things</strong>, including the classic Ink Ribbon save system and new locations. Here's the official overview:</p>



<p><em>This mod is a complete reimagining and expansion of Resident Evil 3 Remake. I’m restoring cut content and adding entirely new locations, expanding the city, and redesigning core gameplay systems to create a darker, more survival-focused experience inspired by the original game. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Features: </strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>New playable locations (city areas, UpTown, Clock Tower, Park, Disused Plant, Cemetery, RPD, and more)</em></li>



<li><em>Expanded and reworked level layouts</em></li>



<li><em>New Nemesis encounters and boss fights</em></li>



<li><em>Redesigned item placement and progression</em></li>



<li><em>New puzzles and mechanics</em></li>



<li><em>Reworked crafting system with multiple new gunpowder types</em></li>



<li><em>Ink Ribbon save system from Resident Evil 2</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The YouTube channel includes several demonstration videos of Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape. We've embedded a few below.</p>

<p>As with all these projects, there is no release window in sight, so <strong>it may be a while before it becomes available</strong>. It isn't, however, the first mod of its kind: in 2020, the <strong>Resident Evil 3 Remake Expanded Map Mod</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-3-remake-expanded-map-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slightly expanded the map</a> and allowed more free exploration in the early game, though its scope was much narrower than Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape.</p>



<p>Out of all the Resident Evil remakes, Resident Evil 3 <strong>is definitely the least successful</strong>, having been criticized by critics and fans alike for its short length, a problem made all the more evident after the cuts of locations like the Clock Tower and the Park, which the mod mentioned in this article is attempting to restore. Even so, perhaps "least successful" deserves air quotes, as the game <strong>still managed to reach CAPCOM's Best-Selling Top 10 chart with 10.90 million units sold</strong> as of the most recent update of this quarter.</p>
