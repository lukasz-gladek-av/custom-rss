			<p>Yesterday, TaleWorlds <a href="https://x.com/Mount_and_Blade/status/1967643361222746569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a big Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord beta update (version 1.3). Steam users can access it by switching to the beta branch in the game's library, though the developer warns that game compatibility with previous saves is not 100% guaranteed, and there may be some instability yet.</p>



<p>No doubt many will give it a try, though, as it's a sizable update that introduces many new features. For example, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord now has a proper stealth system for breaking out of prison and taking on hideouts. NPCs can detect player characters through sight and sound and react to movement, noise, bodies, or alarmed allies. They see more clearly when looking down, but struggle a bit to spot movement above them. Light exposure also plays a role, according to TaleWorlds, with shadows and nighttime offering concealment, while areas lit by torches make you stand out. Natural hiding spots such as tall grass and dark corners also provide stealth, and crouching reduces visibility further.</p>



<p>The NPCs will cycle through four states of alertness: Neutral, Cautious, Searching, and Fully Alarmed. This Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord patch also introduces distraction mechanics with thrown objects and noise-making, but some enemies will resist being diverted. Stealth attacks deal bonus damage to unaware targets, and certain weapons allow for crouched melee and ranged strikes. Players can drag bodies to hide them and prevent alarms from being raised. The player character's roguery skill now also impacts the damage dealt by stealth attacks and your speed and noise level while crouched.</p>



<p>TaleWorlds also added a disguise system to complement stealth. Disguise relies specifically on inconspicuousness; suspicious actions, such as running, drawing weapons, or hiding, raise the guards' suspicion. High suspicion triggers a guard investigation. If you break line of sight, the guards will eventually return to their posts.</p>



<p>If you are identified, your cover is blown, and all guards are placed on full alert and initiate pursuit. Escape requires leaving the settlement, and capture results in imprisonment. If you successfully establish a contact, you can explore the town in disguise, including in any future entries.</p>



<p>But there's more, a lot more to this Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord update, including a significant overhaul for diplomacy. Players can now establish alliances between two kingdoms; each kingdom can have up to two alliances, and an alliance will last for one in-game year. Trade agreements can also be arranged and will feature the same format (up to two, lasting one in-game year). There's even a parley feature with enemy-held settlements containing nobles, where you can select who you wish to speak to from the present nobles.</p>



<p>A new ranged weapon, the Slings, has been introduced to the game. They are one-handed and can be used alongside a shield. Morale and retreat systems have been added to battles and simulations, introducing an extra strategic layer.</p>



<p>There are now up to a hundred random events that players can encounter while playing; these are resolved through pop-up menus, and the resulting choices will influence your character's traits, skills, party, items, or gold. Lastly, there's a new Deserter faction and a new Patrol party type.</p>



<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord is being prepared for its first expansion, War Sails, which will enrich the game with a full-fledged naval warfare system and a new race, the Nords. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch in June</a>, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-2-bannerlord-war-sails-dlc-gameplay-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Fall 2025</a>.</p>

			<p>An Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake from Ubisoft being in the works is one of the videogame industry's currently running open secrets. It's not been officially announced, but there have been several <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake/">rumors</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">leaks</a> pointing towards it being in development for years now, not to mention the fact that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">previously confirmed that remakes of Assassin's Creed games are coming</a>. </p>



<p>But as it's still not officially confirmed, everything we know about it should, technically, be taken with a grain of salt. Today, a new rumor from Jeux Vid√©o Magazine, who have previously reported accurate unannounced information about the Assassin's Creed series, added more salt to the pile, though in a slightly unexpected way.</p>



<p>In the video, Jeux Vid√©o Magazine alleges that there are a few significant changes being made to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag for this remake. One major change is that the game will reportedly lean more into the RPG side of Assassin's Creed that's been building since the release of Assassin's Creed Origins. Edward will even have stats for his gear.</p>



<p>Jeux Vid√©o Magazine also claims that the parts of the game set in the modern day are being removed and replaced by more time spent with Edward Kenway on various pirating adventures. The map isn't getting bigger, but there will be new quests and more to do in the game, loading screens between being in your ship and being on land are gone, it'll bring back content that was cut from the game back in 2013, and it'll be out sometime in the first half of 2026, potentially during March, were among the other big claims Jeux Vid√©o Magazine made regarding the remake.</p>

Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag Remake : Nos 1√®res INFORMATIONS en EXCLUSIVIT√â üî•" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qngrBQnukFc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Again, the remake itself hasn't even been confirmed by Ubisoft, so take all of these claims with the appropriate amount of salt, even considering that Jeux Vid√©o Magazine has been right with leaks similar to this in the past. </p>



<p>But if even a few of those claims end up being true, specifically the removal of modern-day elements and the gameplay changes to make everything lean more towards Ubisoft's RPG era of Assassin's Creed games, then this will be a fairly significant remake compared to the original.</p>



<p>It also opens up interesting thoughts about the rest of the remakes Guillemot has confirmed Ubisoft is working on. Will the rest of the series get a makeover to be closer to the RPGs of late? Are each of the modern-day sections in the games going to be overhauled in some way? Ubisoft has previously discussed that it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-talks-about-the-modern-setting-storyline-in-shadows/">struggled with merging the modern-day story into its historical epics</a>. Could this be a step towards beginning to do away with it or permanently change it?</p>



<p>Those, and a lot more questions, open up if some of these alleged changes end up being true. We'll see what the truth is when Ubisoft finally does announce the remake.</p>
