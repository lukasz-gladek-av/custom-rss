			<p>After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frantic few weeks of rumors</a>, the announcement day for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remaster has arrived. Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a dedicated stream will air today on Twitch and YouTube starting at 11 AM Eastern Time/8 AM Pacific Time/4 PM British Time.</p>
<p>According to rumors, the game should be shadowdropped, meaning that it should also be released right after the stream. Meanwhile, we have uncovered some details about the developer's design philosophy for this project. Bethesda picked Singaporean game developer Virtuos to aid them in this remaster. The studio previously worked on the Nintendo Switch port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-automata-the-end-of-yorha-edition-launches-on-nintendo-switch-this-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NieR Automata: End of Yorha Edition</a> and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-this-christmas-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition</a>, while also collaborating on major triple-A projects like Hogwarts Legacy, Dead Island 2, Horizon Forbidden West - Complete Edition, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>Last year, game development website 80Lv <a href="https://80.lv/articles/virtuos-the-code-behind-remakes-remasters-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Virtuos specifically about their work on remasters and ports. During the interview, Design Director Nicolas Roginski shared a reply that, in hindsight, cannot have been referencing anything other than the Oblivion Remaster:</p>
<p><em>We are working on a very big, unannounced project. Our approach for the design work of this remake is simple but challenging. It’s challenging, mainly because of players’ perception of their old memories. We tend to recollect things much better than they really were. Hence, if we deliver the reality of what gaming was like in the earlier days, there is a good chance that players will be disappointed because it won’t match the “feeling” of their memories.</em></p>
<p><em>To produce a quality remake, we aim at recreating the “feeling of the memory”, not the actual memory. Our design approach at Virtuos is “Keep, Improve, Create”:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keep what is core to the original vision and core memories players have of the original game.</em></li>
<li><em>Improve what you need to modernize because standards have evolved.</em></li>
<li><em>Create in the sense of what needs to be removed or added to surprise the player, and set a new standard for the genre, which has evolved over the years</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtuos is also working alongside Konami on another very big project, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. However, the interview was published in March 2024, while MGS Delta: Snake Eater had been announced in May 2023 and was in fact already referenced in the 80Lv article. As such, it's almost guaranteed that Roginski had to have been referring to the Oblivion Remaster.</p>
<p>The idea of recreating the feeling of the memory is definitely the right one, at least on paper. However, executing that concept is undoubtedly harder than simply adopting it. The return of The Elder Scrolls IV is sure to induce a lot of nostalgia in a lot of people, but only a quality product can make it resurface with positive feelings.</p>
<p>We likely won't have to wait long to judge it all first-hand. Are you excited? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/days-gone-remastered-pc-update-detailed-by-bend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> is coming later this week for PlayStation 5, but PC users will also be able to access the same content and features. When it comes to new modes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-remastered-gets-horde-assault-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horde Assault</a>, Permadeath Mode, and Speedrun Mode will have to be purchased as part of the $10 Broken Road DLC. However, the tech improvements will be released for free with Update 1.08, and Bend has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1259420/view/520837042930712856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full details for the patch:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>DualSense haptic feedback support</em></li>
<li><em>Accessibility features</em></li>
<li><em>World graphical improvements</em></li>
<li><em>New Atmospheric/Sky simulation using ozone and spectral light simulation: Improves overall color tone and produces more accurate light intensities for the sky and sunlight</em></li>
<li><em>Significantly darker night time</em></li>
<li><em>Improved screen space indirect lighting and ambient occlusion effects</em></li>
<li><em>Double shadowmap resolution when Shadow Quality is set to Highest</em></li>
<li><em>Additional improvements</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Days Gone was very&nbsp;<span>good-looking for an Unreal Engine 4 open-world game launched in 2019 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-q-we-were-blown-away-by-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 for PC</a>), but it's been a while, and these enhancements are undoubtedly welcome. Hopefully, alongside the new modes, they'll help shine an even greater light on this entirely underrated game. Unfortunately, Sony has&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nixed the pitch for a sequel</a> and</span>&nbsp;also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Bend's next project earlier this year. Perhaps, if Days Gone Remastered does well enough, they might reconsider the prospects of a sequel. I, for one, certainly appreciated the original game. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>Days Gone puts Bend Studio once again on the map of all PlayStation gamers after many years of oblivion. While it doesn't deliver any meaningful innovations in terms of open world and gameplay mechanics, it's a fun game that sports gorgeous graphics and a surprisingly great story/cast of characters.</em></p>
<p>Days Gone Remastered will be available on Thursday, April 25.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-%E2%80%93-where-to-find-all-notes-%E2%80%93-chapter-9.1169841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-9/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> features plenty of striking visuals, but its strongest aspect is the game's storytelling. Beyond just the cutscenes, the writing in the more than 100 notes in the game's 14 chapters adds excellent context to the story and enhances the experience.</p>
<p>That's why it's worth your time finding every note in each chapter. This guide will show you where to find all the notes in Chapter 9.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 9</h2>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-8/">Chapter 8</a> was very straightforward, with only four notes to find. Chapter 9 has 12 notes, so you'll have to be a little more diligent.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Feline Intuition</strong> - When you exit the cave at the beginning of the level, Hazel will point out a house in the distance. Once she does, pay attention to the right side of the path, where you'll find a hollowed-out tree that houses the first note of the level.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Cross my heart... -&nbsp;</strong>After the cutscene with Itchy, head into the small town across the bridge and go inside the house with red yarn on its roof. You'll find this note on your left when you walk in the door, on the couch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Dear Santa</strong> - This note is in the same house as the previous note, on a table to the right side of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Please Keep In Mind</strong> - After completing the combat encounter to the left of the house with red yarn on its roof, where you found the previous two notes, you can enter a house at the back of the combat arena. This note is right in the doorway, resting on the countertop on the right side of the hallway.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>You'll be sorry</strong> - This note is in the same house as the previous one, on the table at the end of the hall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Molly Gives A Fright</strong> - After completing the combat arena where you found the house with the previous two notes, there will be a couple of ways to exit the arena. Take the one that leads you past two large bramble vines, and on your left will be plenty of Stigma besides a house with a sun painted on the outside. Directly across the street from the house with the sun, you'll find this note on a picnic table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Mandatory Overtime</strong> - Once you've made it into the Pure Pine Factory, head up the stairs that you'll see directly in front of you and into the office to find this note and a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>She Did It</strong> - You'll be able to grab this note after dealing with the tangle in front of Molly's house. As you walk up to the house, this note will be on the right side of the path on a table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Why not me? -&nbsp;</strong>Right as you enter Molly's house, you'll find this note on a table in front of the fireplace.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Dear Miss Molly</strong> - You'll find this note in Molly's house on a table to the left of the stairs leading to the second floor.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Decision of Transfer</strong> - This is the final note in Molly's house, and it can be found on the second floor on a desk to the right of the fireplace.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Is it True? -&nbsp;</strong>The final note of the chapter can be found inside the large house in Molly's cave. You'll enter the house through a narrow entrance, and find this note on a bed immediately to your right once you're inside.</p>
<p>And that's where to find all 12 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 12. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll have found 69 notes by now. Only 34 more to go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-showcases-diablo-iv-season-8-belials-return-gameplay-with-boss-attacks-lair-bosses-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard will give players a complete and detailed look at Diablo IV's Season 8: Belial's Return this <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-will-detail-diablo-ivs-season-8-belials-return-on-april-24/">Thursday, April 24, 2025</a>. However, a new gameplay trailer for Season 8 shows off some of the new boss attacks and lair bosses players will be able to use.</p>
<p>Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189530/combat-deception-in-season-8-belials-return#Deliver">published</a> a detailed blog post delving deeper into combat in Season 8 and the new gameplay trailer. For example, regarding boss powers, there are 24 bosses players can pull attacks from, with each having a main and a modifier effect. We also got a complete list of the boss attacks players can utilize.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Belial's Return | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUlRtsPBg-w?start=83&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Specific boss attacks can be acquired at any difficulty level, while others are only available at Torment I or higher levels. Regarding difficulty levels, Blizzard now has a new tiered system for what were previously considered endgame bosses, with a reworking of its lair bosses.</p>
<p>There are three tiers to lair bosses now: Initiate, Greater, and Exalted. These bosses are only available to you if you're playing on Torment I or a higher difficulty level, and you'll also need to own the Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p>
<p>Blizzard also detailed a few new legendary and unique items players can grind for in Season 8, with new items for Barbarian, Necromancer, Sorcerer, Druid, Rogue, and Spiritborn players.</p>
<p>Another significant change in Season 8 is the introduction of Reliquaries, which is a new way to earn rewards and a "<em>refresh</em>" of the battle pass system in Diablo IV. You'll need to purchase most Reliquaries using Platinum, while certain milestone events will have Reliquaries attached to them upon completion.</p>
<p>There's still more to come later in the week ahead of the launch of Belial's Return on April 29, 2025.</p>
