			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software is pushing toward a far larger, seamless world, and that factored into the developer's decision to drop the minimap seen in previous installments.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAX East 2025 panel</a>, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford explained:</p>
<p><em>This is the biggest (by far) universe that we've built, and it's seamless. There's no load times. You see something anywhere on the screen, a mile away up in the sky, and you will be able to get there. We made a big freaking world. And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there, and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities, several at the same time, that might be miles away. A compass really helps us do that.</em></p>
<p>The other aspect that played into Gearbox's choice is that Borderlands 4 will be much more vertical than its predecessor. Pitchford added:</p>
<p><em>The other thing that the team really wanted to commit to is to push the boundaries of design and environment. Instead of just a single flat plane, they embraced a lot of verticality. You're going to have more verticality in Borderlands 4 than you've ever seen before in a Borderlands game by far, and when you have a layered environment, a top-down two-dimensional view is extremely confusing. With a compass with arrows that tell you if things are up or down, you have a much better sense of spatial awareness, and we want you to play the game, not the map. So, we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system.</em></p>
<p><em>You still have the big map. It's one click away and we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have an AI-driven kind of navigation system that'll give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go, and there's even an in-world companion, Echobot, that has some features there that'll help you navigate.</em></p>
<p>Pitchford didn't rule out adding a minimap to Borderlands 4 at some point in the future (presumably after launch), but told fans to play the game first before judging.&nbsp;That'll happen <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on September 12</a>, when the game is planned to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will release later, and Pitchford talked about that, too, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our previous report</a>.</p>
