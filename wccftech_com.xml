			<p>A few weeks after <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">RAM prices</strong> started spiking due to increased demand from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI data centers</strong> which will take some time to normalize, the critical situation for consumers (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">who apparently have gotten the narrative wrong</a></strong>) has now become evident, as prices for some devices have already been increased, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/"><strong>more are set to follow.</strong></a></p>



<p>Obviously, video game consoles will also be impacted by the current RAM prices and shortages, and another price increase will make the current console generation even more unusual, as it is the first one to date where console prices increased instead of dropping in the years following their launch. For the time being, however, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> may not be impacted by the current unprecedented situation.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a></em> in a new interview</strong> summarized by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Patents Watch</a></em></strong>, president <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Shuntaro Furukawa</strong> commented on the impact the current high RAM prices could have on the new generation Nintendo system, saying that components are <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"procured from suppliers based on Nintendo's medium to long term business plan,"</em> and, as such, the current memory price has no immediate impact on their financial performance and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> price should remain stable for the near future.</p>



<p>However, given the magnitude of the situation, no one can rest easy. <em>"We must monitor the situation closely,"</em> said <strong>Furukawa-san</strong> before refusing to <em>"comment on hypotheticals"</em> regarding a possible price increase for the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Although high RAM prices make any new hardware launch challenging, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo</strong> could be planning a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 Lite</strong> model. During the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kyoto Shimbun</em></strong> interview, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Furukawa-san</strong> mentioned that the company wants to make the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> accessible to people <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"who pick up their first console when reaching a certain age."</em> A cheaper <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2 Lite</strong> model would definitely appeal to a younger crowd but it remains to be seen how affordable such a system would be in the current landscape.</p>



<p>With no slowdown in sight for the AI boom, purchasing a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in the near future seems to be the safest choice for those still looking to get the system. In the future, Nintendo may eventually face a difficult choice: take a hit to its margins to protect the current price point, or <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">follow </strong></a><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Microsoft</a></strong> in increasing the system's price after its launch.</p>
