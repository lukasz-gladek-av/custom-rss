            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 dock may have been designed to let the console run faster, but won't be able to output at smooth framerates at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>A Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NextHandheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextHandheld</a> allegedly has had access to the new console by Nintendo and has revealed some additional information on the system as well as on the dock and Joy-Con controller while also providing proof that their information has merit. Such proof, which includes pictures of the system's dock and the inside of a possible controller rail has also been provided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">The Verge</a>, which concluded that the leaker may be legit after talking with them as well.</p>
<p>While most of the information revealed by NextHandheld falls in line with other rumors and leaks that have been circulating online in the past few weeks, some of the information on the Nintendo Switch 2 dock, which was never shown in any of the previous leaks, is new. The picture of the dock shown to The Verge shows that it has big feet around the back so that it can be placed horizontally without blocking a potential set of vents. While no one would position the dock this way, these feet may have been placed in case the dock is accidentally knocked over to prevent overheating. And if vents are included in the dock, as the leaker seems to have confirmed, albeit cryptically, then there's a very good chance the console will run faster in docked mode. In addition, the leaker revealed that the dock is rated for 60W, while the Nintendo Switch 2 for 45W, values that are considerably higher than the original model, and that it will only output<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hgikth/comment/m2mwv50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 4K resolution at 30 frames per second,</a> which would definitely be disappointing if true.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, NextHandheld also revealed plenty of other information on the Nintendo Switch 2. You can find a summary of the information shared by the leaker on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hf06co/switch_2_ama_with_next_handheld_summarized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit. </a>Despite the proof the leaker has provided, we strongly suggest taking all the new information with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but there's been some chatter that its reveal could happen right after the new year begins. No matter when it is revealed and released, the console is projected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/">most successful next-generation system</a>, something that will further solidify Nintendo's position as the console market leader for the next few years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76 Ghoul Experience Detailed by Bethesda]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tomorrow, Bethesda Game Studios will open up the gates of the Fallout 76 PTS (Public Test Server) to allow fans to play as a Ghoul for the first time in the franchise, likely in response to the massive acclaim enjoyed by the TV show's Cooper Howard character played by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they shared a few details with the press. Playing as a Ghoul (with customizable design and even skin texture) is an endgame experience, as the related quest only starts at level 50. Ghouls will have 'dozens of alternate ways' to specialize their character, according to the developers.</p>
<p>To begin with, they are not only immune to radiation; it actually heals them. If your character is hurt, standing on top of some radioactive material will start healing them. Moreover, once fully healed, the excess radiation will build up into a new resource called Glow. Depending on how the player character is specialized, Glow can provide various effects. Ghouls can also utilize 32 exclusive perk cards on top of those already available for human characters, providing great variety when it comes to character progression.</p>
<p>Ghouls do not feel hunger or thirst in Fallout 76. However, they must manage a feral meter instead. If a character turns full feral, they'll suffer from drawbacks like reduced hit points and worse accuracy with weapons, but they'll also get a boost in hand-to-hand combat, potentially unlocking a berserker type of playstyle.</p>

<p>Many NPCs (non-player characters) and factions will interact differently with player ghouls, such as the Brotherhood of Steel, who do not take kindly to ghouls. You won't be blocked from their stories, though; instead, this will reportedly open up new narrative paths to experience. Bethesda also said there will be in-world ways to disguise your being a Ghoul. Last but not least, player Ghouls will have the ability to revert to human form, though you will only be able to do this once for free.</p>
<p>There's no final release date for this update yet, although the developers aim to launch it sometime in early 2025. As a reminder, Fallout 76 was recently updated with a brand new raid experience called <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths</a>, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMO-style endgame dungeon</a> where a party of four players must go through five tough encounters to obtain the new four-star legendary weapons.</p>
