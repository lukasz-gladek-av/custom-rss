			<p>The October 23 Borderlands 4 patch introduces undocumented performance improvements on PC, according to a new comparison video shared on YouTube.</p>



<p>The video shared by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC </a>highlights how the latest update for the new entry in the series by Gearbox Software introduces a roughly 10% performance improvement at both 4K and 1440p resolutions. While barely hitting 59 FPS at 4K resolution on a powerful GPU like the RTX 5080 is still a strong indication that more work is needed to improve Borderlands 4, these improvements are a step in the right direction.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides introducing these undocumented performance improvements on PC, the Borderlands 4 October 23 patch introduces widespread stability improvements, multiplayer fixes, UI polish and quality-of-life updates to celebrate the game's first month of availability on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>The patch also brings significant balance changes to further refine late-game, mission flow, and the overall player experience. The full details of everything the new patch brings can be found on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/525357766327403014?l=english">official Borderlands 4 October 23 patch notes.</a></p>



<p>While work continues on the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S versions of the game, the development of the Borderlands 4 Nintendo Switch 2 port is also continuing. Originally scheduled for an October 2025 release, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">the port was delayed indefinitely last month</a>, and all pre-orders have been refunded. Given the game's current performance woes on all platforms, the Switch 2 version was likely delayed due to performance concerns.</p>

			<p>At the end of the Ninja Gaiden 4 campaign, Yakumo acquires a fifth weapon, the Dark Dragon Blade, which allows him to fight the game's final boss on equal ground. Here's how to permanently unlock this powerful final weapon in less than 30 minutes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Method tested in the game's Steam 1.0.1.0 version after the completion of two different playtroughs, which the author played at Normal and Hard difficulty. Screenshots captured from the same version.</strong></em></p>

<p>The <strong>Dark Dragon Blade</strong> is the final weapon for Yakumo. It is permanently unlocked by completing the following steps:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Defeat the Dark Dragon</strong> in Chapter 19 to complete the main campaign. Any difficulty will do. This will unlock additional post-game content, including the <strong>Boss Trial</strong> challenges.</li>



<li><strong>Complete all of the Boss Trial challenges</strong> to permanently unlock the <strong>Dark Dragon Blade</strong> and use it in Story Mode and Challenge Mode, including Chapter Challenge, Purgatorium re-runs, and Combat Trials.</li>
</ol>

<figure><figcaption><em>Use the Senjin War Brew item to increase your attack power and cut down the time needed to defeat the enemy in the Boss Trial challenges</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Fighting and defeating all 13 of the main campaign bosses can take significant time and effort, especially powerful bosses like Ryu Hayabusa. However, there is a way to speed up the process considerably taking advantage of some of the game's difficulty mechanics.</p>



<p>This method uses the <strong>Hero Difficulty</strong> setting, which increases your damage output and dramatically lowers boss health, making the challenge trivial:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pre-Boss Difficulty Switch:</strong> Before confirming a Boss Trial challenge, press the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">R1/Right Button</strong> on your controller to switch to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Hero difficulty</strong>. And when prompted, activate<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> Auto-Dodge</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Auto-Assist</strong> to react automatically to enemy attacks, allowing you to just mash the attack buttons safely and cut down the time needed to defeat them.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Maximize Damage:</strong> During the trial, hold the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">R1 / Right Button</strong> to bring up the Item Wheel and use the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Senjin War Brew item</strong> to increase your damage output. Make sure to use the item again after the effect expires.</li>



<li><strong>Pick the Best Weapon</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">:</strong> At the start of each trial, press the left direction on your d-pad to select the <strong>Kage-Hiruko</strong> weapon. Being a ranged weapon, it allows you to continue attacking even when the enemy tries to get away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following this strategy, I completed all 13 trials in<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> 23 minutes and 4.412 seconds</strong>. Even accounting for menu loading and challenge setup, you will need <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">less than 30 minutes</strong> total to unlock the Dark Dragon Blade using this method.</p>



<p>Even with the Dark Dragon Blade in tow, Yakumo's journey is hardly a walk in the park at normal difficulty and above. Check out our other <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ninja-gaiden-4-guides/">Ninja Gaiden 4 guides</a> to make the best out of the game's intricate combat mechanics.</p>
