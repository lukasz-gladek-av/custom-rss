<h2>How To Use Skill Books in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>As you're adventuring as Indiana Jones, you'll be able to obtain Adventure Books. You can also call them Skill Books, as that is technically what they are. They provide new skills or buffs to your pre-existing skills, which can help you survive in the vast world you'll explore, as well as help you with combat and brawling. Picking up the book doesn't automatically mean that you've learned a new skill, though. By cycling to the Books tab in your main menu, you'll find a list of all of the books you've found under their relevant categories.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the books that are available in that category. If you hover over the book that interests you, it will tell you what you need to be able to use the book and learn the skill. To learn a skill, you need <strong>Adventure Points</strong>. Adventure Points are earned by finding secrets during your exploration, by collecting hidden items such as posters and letters, and even by taking pictures using your camera. There are plenty of things hidden in the world of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, making it easy for you to tally up Adventure Points fast enough, as long as you're thorough with your exploration and look in every nook and cranny you come across.</p>
<p>Once you have the required amount of Adventure Points, you'll then be able to learn the skill by reading the book, and the skill will be activated, allowing you to use it when you need to.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about how to use skill books in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Good luck exploring!</p>
