			<p>A new announcement related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> will be made later this week, but it won't be about new content hitting the game, a CD Projekt Red representative confirmed.</p>



<p>Commenting on speculation made about the announcement on X, CD Projekt Red Senior Community Manager Amelia "Lilayah" confirmed the announcement won't be about a new patch or new DLC. The community manager also reiterated that no Cyberpunk 2077 DLC is in the works, unsurprisingly, so expectations should be kept in check regarding the game getting some new major content in the future.</p>

<p>As for what the Cyberpunk 2077 announcement coming on September 4 will be about, no one can say at the moment. This announcement was teased yesterday with an in-lore recruitment ad from the New United States of America, of which Night City is part, revealing a recruitment test for <em>"brave netrunners"</em> willing to join the nation's effort to overcome a mounting cybersecurity threat. Given how Project Orion, the second entry in the series, is still very far from release, could this be a colorful way to announce playtests for an upcoming, smaller project related to the series? Thankfully, the announcement is only a few days away, so it won't take much longer to find out what this is about.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

Pitchford also expressed the desire to bring more Gearbox games to the platform, though he wouldn't elaborate any further than that on this topic.</p>



<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an awesome, awesome machine – I'm so grateful for it. It's less about innovating and more about perfecting, and giving us what we want and what works. I love my Switch, and I kind of wanted a more powerful one with newer games. When I got the briefing and realized, 'oh, it's more than that, Nintendo has invested a lot, not just in the hardware, but in the software, and making it easier than ever to connect with other people. This is getting exciting.</em></p>



<p><em>I love Switch, and I love my Nintendo Switch 2, and I think that without getting in trouble and trying to talk about things that are from the future, we love making games, and we love entertaining people, and we want to be on the platforms where the people that want us to be are. And Nintendo just had the most successful new console launch in the history of video game consoles, and I don't think that's slowing down.</em> <em>I love that platform, and I want to bring more games to it, but it's really not the right time for me to talk about games that are down the road.</em></p>



<p>As far as we know, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-and-brothers-in-arms-games-listed-on-developers-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working</a> on a new Brothers in Arms game and possibly Tiny Tina's Wonderlands 2, a sequel to the 2022 spin-off featuring the titular Tiny Tina as the 'dungeon master'. The completion status of these projects is currently unclear.</p>

			<p>The first look at a never-before-seen Battlefield 6 map has been provided today by a new leaked video.</p>



<p>The video, which has been shared by the same user who provided the first look at the game's Battle Royale map yesterday, showcases the Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm map, a mostly flat map featuring a unique atmosphere. Sadly, the player doesn't do a very good job showcasing the map in full due to their playstyle and high FOV settings, but those eagerly anticipating the game's release next month will surely appreciate taking a look at a map that will supposedly be part of the game's very first season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although it took EA and the many development teams working on the game to unveil it, the long wait hasn't damped the excitement surrounding Battlefield 6, as proven by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">incredible numbers</a> pulled by the open beta held last month. Some data gleaned from the testing phases also revealed how many PC users taking part in the test ran the beta client on minimum specs and lower, highlighting the need to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">optimize for weaker systems</a> to allow as many users as possible to enjoy the game as intended. With this being one of the focuses of the developers, it was not surprising to hear the game won't support ray tracing and likely never will, to focus on performance, which is definitely the right choice for a competitive shooter.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Sales Have Been Impacted By The High Price of the PlayStation 5, CAPCOM’s President Says]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-been-impacted-by-the-high-price-of-the-playstation-5-capcom%E2%80%99s-president-says.1286196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sales of Monster Hunter Wilds have been impacted by the high price of the PlayStation 5, and not by any issue the game may have, according to CAPCOM's president Haruhiro Tsujimoto.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5s-steep-price-a-barrier-for-potential-monster-hunter-wilds-players-capcom-president-says/">Automaton</a>, Tsujimoto-san talked with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Nikkei Gaming</a> about the sales of the latest entry in one of the most popular gaming franchises ever, which were quite strong at launch, but fell off quickly in the following months, saying that the high price of the PlayStation 5, which the publisher considers the main platform for the game, has impacted its performance on the market. Taking into consideration the price of the system, accessories and the PlayStation Plus subscription required to play online, plus the price of the game, getting to play Monster Hunter Wilds can be costly, especially for young players with no income, so it would make more sense for some of them to get previous entries in the series featuring a lot more content like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a> which can be purchased for far less. As such, the biggest challenge for the publisher will be to make the game as accessible as possible to new players, and it is planning a strategy to take advantage of future discounts to improve sales starting in these final months of the year.</p>



<p>In the same interview, the CAPCOM's president also commented on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, saying that the system's success was better than the publisher expected, highlighting its lower price compared to Sony's system. The succcess of the new Nintendo console reaffirmed how cost-conscious users are all over the world, Tsujimoto-san commented.</p>



<p>It's a shame Monster Hunter Wilds is not proving to be as successful as past entries in the series, as the game is a more than worthy entry in the series, even with its issues, such as the low challenge level which the development team has been addressing with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">free updates and content</a>. You can learn more about the game now out on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
