			<p>A new Unreal Engine 5 feature pushed to the engine's main development branch last week could pave the way for significant Lumen performance improvements across the board and for the lighting technology to be implemented in Nintendo Switch 2 games.</p>



<p>As reported by<a href="https://x.com/DylserX"> tech artist Dylan Browne on X</a>, Lumen Irradiance Cache, a probe-based Lumen mode for lower-end devices, is now available in the Epic engine. Compared to the default Hardware Lumen, the new mode features less occlusion detail and worse reflections, but it's still a good compromise compared to having no Lumen at all, judging from the comparison video below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lumen Irradiance Cache | New Probe Based Lumen For Lower End | Unreal Engine" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkLmUPJvhsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As the Unreal Engine 5 Lumen Irradiance Cache is still in a very early state, it is difficult to say how much low-power devices will benefit from it. However, things are looking quite promising already. According to a now-removed GitHub commit, which was captured before removal and shared on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-ps5-power-saver-mode-tested-a-green-initiative-next-gen-handheld-teaser-or-both.1335199/#post-146877265">ResetERA forums</a>, Lumen Radiance Cache speeds up the Lumen gather stage by 2.5 times for an overall Lumen Scene speedup of 1.5.</p>



<p>This lighter version of Lumen could finally make Unreal Engine 5‚Äôs signature lighting viable on lower-power hardware like the Nintendo Switch 2, even if in a limited form. At this time, games powered by the engine released on the new generation Nintendo console, such as Cronos: The New Dawn, don't feature Lumen, most likely because <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nitendo-switch-2-held-back-cpu/">the console's CPU&nbsp;can't run games with such demanding features at an acceptable performance level.</a></p>



<p>As even Fortnite doesn't run with Lumen and Nanite on the Nintendo Switch 2, it's clear that dedicated work had to be made on the engine for the console to support these hallmark features, which seems to be already happening with the implementation of this new Lumen option. Hopefully, it won't take long for developers to take advantage of it and bring Switch 2 ports closer to the other console versions in terms of visual fidelity.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A Had ‚ÄòMassive‚Äô Retail Launch in the US, Biggest Since Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-massive-retail-launch-in-the-us/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-had-%E2%80%98massive%E2%80%99-retail-launch-in-the-us-biggest-since-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom.1335964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last Friday, The Pok√©mon Company <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, the latest entry in the ever-popular monster catching franchise, had sold 5.8 million copies in its debut week.</p>



<p>Now, Circana's Senior Director &amp; Video Game Industry Thought Leader, Mat Piscatella, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's retail launch was particularly big in the United States, where it registered the best performance of the last two and a half years.</p>



<p><em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A had a massive US launch at retail. Launch week physical unit and dollar sales of Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A were the biggest for a new physical video game launch since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom back in May of 2023.</em></p>



<p>It's not at all surprising that Nintendo games excel at retail sales performance. PlayStation and Xbox users have long since switched to digital games, but the Nintendo audience is different and still quite linked to physical units.</p>



<p>In Europe, though, the retail launch was a bit smaller. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pokemon-legends-z-a-captures-no1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Game Business</a>, which had access to GSD data, Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A managed to knock EA's Battlefield 6 from the top position but also registered a 28% sales drop compared to the debut week of Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus in 2022. Indeed, as noted back when the official sales announcement was shared last week, Arceus had sold 6.5 million units in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>Still, the game appears to have received the acclaim of fans and critics alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch wrote:</p>



<p><em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully constructed Pok√©mon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-battlefield-redsec-launches-tomorrow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-battlefield-6-free-to-play-battle-royale-mode-officially-called-battlefield-redsec-launches-tomorrow.1335916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 battle royale mode has finally been revealed and will officially be called Battlefield REDSEC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/">As rumoured</a>, it'll launch tomorrow, and it'll be free-to-play.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios revealed the mode with <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155">a short post on the official Battlefield X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, which included a link to a gameplay trailer that'll go live tomorrow, alongside the mode itself going live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We'll have more official knowledge on the mode tomorrow when the gameplay trailer goes live, which will likely <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news">be followed by a blog post on the Battlefield 6 website</a>, though for now we do have other claims from ModernWarzeon, the X (formerly Twitter) account who initially leaked the REDSEC title and correctly claimed it would be shadow dropped tomorrow.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, Battlefield REDSEC will arrive with a Duos and Squads queues, letting players hop in as teams of two or teams of four, with a maximum player count of 100 players for matches.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>üö® BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST üö®</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>‚Äî ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Battlefield REDSEC will also be arriving alongside Season 1 for Battlefield 6, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">which, as I noted in my preview,</a> is adding a couple of stellar Conquest maps with Blackwell Ridge and Eastwood, but a couple of lacklustre game modes with the permanent and limited time modes to come. What makes the arrival of REDSEC even more exciting is that it'll be a peek at what is arguably going to be the best map in Battlefield 6, Eastwood, since the opening map for REDSEC is set in Southern California.</p>



<p>REDSEC is EA and Battlefield Studio's response to Call of Duty: Warzone, and it could not have come at a more opportune time for Battlefield since the Call of Duty brand <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">continues to be in an identity crisis</a>. It also seems like EA and Battlefield Studios are taking advantage of Battlefield 6 launching more than a month ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, capitalizing on FPS players who would otherwise be spending their time waiting for the new Call of Duty to release.</p>



<p>Of course, they could still be doing that while playing Battlefield 6, dropping it for Black Ops 7 when that arrives in November, but for now EA has the chance to get its hooks into players that would otherwise not give Battlefield the time of day. We'll see how REDSEC does when it arrives tomorrow.</p>
