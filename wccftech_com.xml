			<p>Nexon has consistently kept The First Descendant at the forefront of graphics and display technologies. The free-to-play third-person looter shooter game looked great from the first time we saw it, but it was initially developed with Unreal Engine 4. However, the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-qa-on-the-game-ue5-implementation-and-future-dlss-3-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> to Unreal Engine 5 as soon as they could to take advantage of Nanite and Lumen, as they believed the latter in particular to be 'essential' for next-generation projects.</p>
<p>In the first interview published on Wccftech two years ago, the developers confirmed support for various ray traced effects, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, and Intel XeSS. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of its support for Samsung's HDR10+ displays, and a few months ago, The First Descendant was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to integrate NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, also known as Ray Reconstruction, which enhances ray tracing effects on GeForce RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>Nexon didn't just work hard on the PC version, anyway. The PlayStation 5 version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-descendant-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported</a> Unreal Engine 5's high-resolution Virtual Shadow map technique, as well as ray tracing and even AMD FSR Frame Generation, the latter of which is only available in two or three PS5 games so far.</p>
<p>It's not that surprising, then, that The First Descendant will also be the first PS5 Pro game to support the new PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution in combination with AMD FSR Frame Generation. Here's what Engine Programmer Junhwan Kim told Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our PS5 Pro-focused Q&amp;A</a>:</p>
<p><em>The most impressive aspect during the PS5 Pro adaptation process was the AI-driven upscaling technology known as PSSR. On the existing PS5 base model, the FSR Image Upscaling feature is typically used, which has some drawbacks, such as pixel ghosting and pixel jittering during the pixel reconstruction process. The PS5 Pro's Image Upscaling based on PSSR minimizes these weaknesses and delivers highly impressive results.</em></p>
<p><em>The original PS5 base model offered FSR upscaling and FSR frame generation features. On the PS5 Pro, we provide an option that combines PSSR with FSR frame generation, allowing for a higher-resolution, high-frame-rate experience compared to before.</em></p>
<p>The First Descendant on PS5 Pro will also feature improved ray tracing effects: ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced Lumen diffuse, ray-traced opaque, and translucency surface reflection.</p>
<p>But it's the implementation of both PSSR and AMD FSR Frame Generation that could really pave the way for optimal visual quality and performance on Sony's latest console, which is due to launch tomorrow at $699/£699/€799. We'll see whether more developers follow Nexon's example in this regard.</p>

			<p>The Stranger Things VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-things-vr-winter-2023/">made by Tender Claws</a> will be released for PlayStation VR2 and Steam VR. If you want to get your hands on this game based in the Stranger Things universe, you'll be able to pre-order it now for $24.99 via the PlayStation Store. For those who are PlayStation Plus members, you'll be eligible for a 20% discount. This title was originally released on Quest 2 and Quest 3 on February 22. However, it is now making its way onto more VR consoles and platforms to make the game more accessible. The art style is really cartoonist and stylized, making it perfect for those who want that indie feel to a game and to see the characters designed in a slightly different way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stranger Things VR - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r6rEJ5AqzJM?start=28&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This announcement comes just shortly before the announcement made by Netflix teasing the Stranger Things 5 title. This series is set to take place in the Fall of 1987 and is the "one last adventure," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-2LIjOt0rA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to release in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>In Stranger Things VR, you get to experience the world of Stranger Things from a never-seen-before perspective of Vecna. You get to explore unknown realities and work towards forming the hive mind. In this game, you're the villain in its entirety. You get to work to create your revenge plan and how you'll wreak havoc in the lives of Eleven and Hawkins.</p>
<p>While you get to play as Henry Creel, you'll get information that shows how he transforms into Vecna, as you can also invade the dreams and memories of some of the favorite characters in the show, such as Billy Hargrove and Will Byers. Additionally, you get to use the telekinetic powers that Vecna has in the show to possess the minds of others, as well as utilize them in combat against creatures.</p>
<p>The telekinetic powers allow you to grab, crush, and throw your opponents, which can make for some great chaos. As you slowly transform into Vecna, you get to relive Henry's memories from when he was in the Hawkins Lab with Dr. Brenner, allowing you to explore an interconnected hive mind with otherworldly properties.</p>
<p>One of the actions you can use can have severe consequences, but it's up to you whether you use it. You will be able to open and close portals between worlds and realities, but it is at your peril. Whether anything good will come of it remains to be seen in how you play the game.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Stranger Things VR?</p>

			<p>If you're going to be a blood-sucker, you at least want to be fashionable when you do it. In a new dev diary released by The Chinese Room and Paradox Interactive, they've teamed up to discuss how fashion plays a part in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. Each clan has its own set of styles that make it easily identifiable when speaking to them or exploring the streets of Seattle.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-character-trailer-shows-off-the-kindred-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/">four base clans</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 each have their own unique style to represent personality, history, and subcultures through their fashion. When creating the fashion in the game, they wanted to make sure that they were offering players "a variety of styles to suit their tastes."&nbsp; Not only did they make sure that there were different outfits for the Protagonist, but they also made sure that the Foley was fairly attributed to the outfit, with the sounds of shoes or the rustling of clothes. For example, "creating a more stealth-like feeling or the aggressive presence that one might expect between Banu Haqim vs Brujah," says Lead Audio Designer Tessa Verplancke.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Additionally, making sure that outfits matter in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, characters are also able to judge their outfits, such as interactions you have with Tolly. This is shown in a brief clip on the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-fashion-matters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradox Interactive website</a>.</p>
<p>As the protagonist in this game, clothing matters because of the sound it can make. For example, if you want to feed on the right Blood Resonance, you need to make sure that you're wearing clothes that fit the mood of the person you're approaching.</p>
<p>"Just knowing that the angry sex worker nearby is full of choleric blood and ready for a fight is just step one. Step two is making sure that you're wearing something that will push them over the edge and really make that blood boil. Dressing and acting like a wealthy John could get them talking, but if you approach looking like someone who likes it rough? That might scare them right out of their angry mood, and then all that delicious choleric potential goes away," says Senior Narrative Designer Arone LeBray.</p>
<p>This dev diary is now the 21st diary released by Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room, providing a wealth of information about the importance of character customization and making sure you know how to dress appropriately for the occasion.</p>
