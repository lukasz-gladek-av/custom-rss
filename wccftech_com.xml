			<p>An Elden Ring Nightreign duos mod is currently in the works, and its release could address one of the game's most critical issues at launch.</p>
<p>The mod, which is sadly not yet available to the public, is being developed by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukeyui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yui</a>, who showcased it in a new video shared on YouTube. As the mod runs without connecting to the matchmaking service, Easy Anti Cheat is deactivated and thus other mods can be used during gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign: 2 player demonstration (w/ no EAC &amp; mod compatible)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbKF9TOiMWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Elden Ring Nightreign development team already <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">confirmed</a> that duos could be added to the game in the future, it's nice to know that, at least on PC, a two-player mode could be a thing, regardless of what the developer decides to do. One of the other critical issues of the latest game developed by FromSoftware, the lack of cross-platform play, however, cannot be easily fixed with mods, so hopefully, the development team will look at implementing it down the line in some form.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about this unique take on the Souls series formula by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

			<p>HLX, the project in development by Valve rumored to be Half-Life 3, may be close to the end of development, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McViker</a> in a recent video, big updates have been pushed for Deadlock and Dota 2, and they are more packed than has been seen in years of changes made to the Source 2 engine related to the HLX project, some of them heavily suggesting that the project is near to the end of development. For example, one of the new changes is a save and load system rewritten from scratch, which allows for the state of any entity within the game world to be edited in the save file. No other game powered by the Source 2 engine has a save and load system, as even Half-Life Alyx used the system lifted from the previous version of the engine. While this addition may not sound particularly significant, it actually is, as rewriting from scratch such a basic system is usually part of the polishing phase at the end of development.</p>
<p>Other additions, such as the introduction of three new player flags that determine if the player is in a situation where it is not possible to save, is driving a vehicle or is inside a vehicle driven by an NPC, are also, usually, additions made to the end of development, so it definitely seems like work on the project rumored to be Half-Life 3 is close to completion. The fact that work on HLX may be close to completion, however, doesn't mean that the game is going to be announced soon, so expectations should be kept in check for the incoming not-E3 season that will begin next week.</p>
<p>Besides the addition outlined above, the latest updates pushed for some Source 2-powered games added a few more files related to the yet-to-be-revealed HLX project, including support for meshlets, surface properties having attributes specifically related to vehicle-based gameplay, vehicle transportation for both player and NPCs, electrical interactions simulated system similar to the systems allowing for flammability of elements and material deformation, electrification of surfaces and props, improved sight and hearing system to allow the enemy to better detect the player, a wind system that can interact with volumetric fog and flammability-based items related to a fan system that should allow wind to move players, NPCs and objects and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="17 New HLX Leaks, it's Almost Here - HLX Files #11" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUj4iMRKGqM?start=3&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeing how much work is being put into the HLX project rumored to be Half-Life 3, there's no doubt that something is indeed cooking up at Valve. The game is rumored to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/">final entry in the series</a>, so even though its story hook may not be <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-main-story-hook/">widely appreciated</a>, at least fans will be getting a conclusion to the story, and not another cliffhanger that could be left unresolved for decades.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-how-to-change-skins.1202397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> does not feature the same degree of character customization as other games developed by FromSoftware or other multiplayer-focused games, but this doesn't mean that it's not possible to change your Nightfarer's appearance. During your war against the Night in Limveld, you can unlock different skins for all characters, allowing you to alter their appearance and make each Nightfarer feel more like your own.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250530111235_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Changing skins, or Garbs, in Elden Ring Nightreign is really easy</strong>, and does not require performing any complicated operation or getting to a hard-to-reach location. To change the appearance of any Nightfarer, <strong>open the Roundtable Hold main menu, and select Change Garb</strong> to get transported instantly to the mirror inside the main hub that allows changing skins.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250530111240_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of your adventure in Elden Ring Nightreign, the only available skin will be the one representing the Nightfarers' vanilla appearance, but more can be unlocked by playing the game and completing Remembrance episodes, the personal quests of each Nightfarer which provides additional details on their story, and how they ended up in Roundtable Hold to fight the war against the Nightlords. You will also need Murk, the only in-game currency, to unlock them, but the currency is pretty easy to come by, as you are rewarded with a minimal amount even for Expeditions, so if you play the game enough, you won't have any trouble unlocking additional skins with little difficulty.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign – Can You Play Solo?]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-can-you-play-solo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-can-you-play-solo.1202352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-can-you-play-solo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different game from every other game developed by FromSoftware, sporting the mechanics made popular by their Souls series. Instead of making co-op multiplayer an optional element that can make certain segments of the game easier, the experience has been designed around co-op, resulting in a game that is clearly best played together with two other players.</p>
<p>Despite this, <strong>the challenges that the land of Limveld offers can be experienced by lone Nightfarers not keen on teaming up with others.</strong> Doing so it's extremely simple. All you need to do is <strong>interacting with the big table found in the central area of the Roundtable Hold</strong> main hub, press the <strong>R1 / right shoulder button</strong> on your controller to access the <strong>Matchmaking Settings tab</strong>, scroll down to the Expedition Type option and press either left or right to change between Multiplayer and <strong>Single Player</strong>. Once the option has been set to Single Player, any expedition you choose to embark upon will be played solo.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250526143623_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While it is definitely possible to play Elden Ring Nightreign by yourself,<strong> should you do so</strong>? In terms of incentives, the game provides none, as the experience has been clearly balanced around co-op, so by playing solo, you will still have to handle a massive number of enemies, even during select boss battles, with only lower hit point values than in co-op mode. As such, playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo can often end up being a frustrating experience, and should be considered as an option only if you want to practice against bosses, find optimal strategies and prepare for multiplayer sessions. Completing certain Remembrances episodes can be faster in solo mode as well. So, if you want to truly experience the game at its best, you will have to team up with others.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign – What Do You Get For Defeating The Tutorial Boss?]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-what-do-you-get-for-defeating-the-fell-omen-in-the-tutorial/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-what-do-you-get-for-defeating-the-tutorial-boss.1202313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-what-do-you-get-for-defeating-the-fell-omen-in-the-tutorial/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In true FromSoftware fashion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> features a challenging boss battle against a familiar face from the original game in the tutorial that is meant to be lost, which delivers a straightforward message: the game is challenging. While this first fight against the Fell Omen can be difficult, it can be won using a relatively simple strategy, and you will also get a nice reward for your effort.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529133512_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As the tutorial features a set number of enemies and specific equipment, putting together a <strong>winning strategy is much easier than in the actual <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> experience</strong>. Make sure to defeat every enemy you encounter as you proceed and open every treasure chest. By doing so, you can get to level 6 and have the Cold Katar and Rogier's Rapier Armaments in your possession. Equip both of them to use the powerful <strong>Hoarfrost Stump</strong> skill and activate the <strong>Multiple Periodical Glintblades</strong> passive.</p>
<p>With these Armaments equipped, head over to the ruins where the Fell Omen awaits, <strong>bring the Duchess back to life</strong> as prompted, and wait for the enemy to appear. When it does, keep your distance, let the Duchess hold his attention, and <strong>use Hoarfrost Stump or attack repeatedly with the Cold Katar after he uses any hammer attack to inflict frostbite</strong>. Once you have accomplished this, keep your distance and attack only after the boss uses hammer attacks, letting the Continual Glintblades deal some nice burst damage without doing anything else. If the Duchess dies, use the <strong>Wylder's Ultimate Art</strong> to bring her back instantly. Try as much as you can to defeat the boss without dying, as you won't have the Duchess' help during your second and final try, making everything much more challenging.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529133752_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After defeating the Fell Omen, sit in the chair to end the tutorial and begin the proper Elden Ring Nightreign experience. As you awaken in the Roundtable Hold, you will be informed of having been gifted the Fell Omen Fetish relic, which boosts your attack power when you switch weapons, improves throwing knife damage, and increases Vigor by 1. If you have not defeated the Fell Omen on your first try, you can<strong>&nbsp;replay through the tutorial</strong> by accessing the Visual Codex, selecting Guide, and pressing the Square/ X button.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-5-tips-to-conquer-the-night/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-5-tips-to-conquer-the-night.1202283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-5-tips-to-conquer-the-night/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though rooted deeply into the hardcore action-RPG mechanics made popular by the Souls series, Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different sort of experience from what FromSoftware usually offers in its games. With a focus on co-op play and a time limit, playing the new game from the Japanese studio can feel overwhelming for those more used to the slower pace of typical soulslike.</p>
<p>To help you better understand the unique take on the Soulslike mechanics featured in Elden Ring Nightreign, and to start having fun just a few Expeditions in, here are a few tips that will be helpful as you run from one side of the other of Limveld, trying to stay one step ahead of the Night.</p>
<h2>1 - Plan For the Whole Game</h2>
<p>With the first two in-game days lasting only 15 minutes, you must upgrade your character as quickly as possible in Elden Ring Nightreign. As such, you will want to start planning what to do right from the start of a game. While the spectral hawk is carrying you to Limveld, open up the map and locate the most critical upgrades to have an easier time later in the game, and plan around their locations. Flask charges, situated inside the churches with a gold outline, are a must for survivability, so grab them as quickly as possible, possibly clearing a few other locations along the way to level up and get your first few upgrades. If you can, prioritize locations on the edges of the map, as there's a good chance they will no longer be available for the day once the Night approaches.</p>
<h2>2 - Level Up As Much as You Can</h2>
<p>While it can be tempting to explore an enemy camp or an enemy stronghold near your landing point at the start of the game, it's not a very good idea to head into them at a low level. Look around your starting location, find some mobs, and take them down to get some runes and level up to at least level 3 to have a much easier time. In Elden Ring Nightreign, character level matters a lot, as it not only increases stats but also allows your Nightfarer to wield weapons of higher rarity, so you will want to make some quick preparations before heading into any location guarded by bosses. Dying will also make you waste time, which you don't have a lot of in the game.</p>
<h2>3 - Ignore Mobs</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250520003440_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Killing mobs at the start of a game in Elden Ring Nightreign is the way to go to level up enough to handle bosses, but after reaching level 3, it's almost always a good idea to ignore all those mobs that aren't getting in the way. After a certain point, the runes you get from defeating them are not worth the time you need to dispose of them, which could be used to take down bosses, which give plenty of runes and offer you one between three different upgrades, which may be more crucial to defeating a Nightlord than runes to level up. This holds even more true when going through the Castle in the center of Limveld. This location is filled with enemies that reward Nightfarers with upgrades, so ignore the mobs to get to them as quickly as possible to reap some beneficial rewards.</p>
<h2>4 - Get a Ranged Combat Option</h2>
<p>By pressing the Triangle or Y button with the map open, you will be able to get more information on the upgrades that can be obtained in each location in Limveld, and you will be surprised by how many bows and ranged weapons can be found. There's a good reason for this: ranged combat options work great in Elden Ring Nightreign, as you have infinite ammo and can spam attack from a safe distance. Having to resort to healing as little as possible, taking out enemies from afar is extremely important, so make sure to get a ranged attack option for your character, no matter how good they may be at using it. The same goes for all magic spells, as they can make your life significantly easier under certain conditions. Most Nightlords don't leave themselves open too often, so having a ranged attack option is a great help against these powerful enemies as well.</p>
<h2>5 - Don't Go Off on Your Own</h2>
<p>Going off alone in Elden Ring Nightreign can be tempting, especially if you have uncollaborative companions, but doing so is never a good idea. Always stick together with your fellow Nightfarers, as there's nothing that you can do by yourself that can help the team as a whole. For example, you may defeat some bosses by yourself, but your companions will not receive upgrades automatically, only runes, rendering your efforts almost useless, in the grand scheme of things. With more experienced Nightfarers and excellent team coordination, spreading out may be a viable strategy to take down multiple bosses and rush from one location to the next picking upgrades, but this requires a lot of game knowledge as well, which you will obviously lack at the start of your adventure in Limveld.</p>
