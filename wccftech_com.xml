			<p>As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-is-working-on-an-open-world-shooter.1036452/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra's Uzupedro, Blizzard Entertainment is currently hiring personnel for an unannounced open world shooter game. The <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job</a> is for an Associate Design Director of Innovation.</p>
<p><em>At Blizzard, we craft genre-defining games and legendary worlds for all to share. Through unparalleled creativity and storytelling, we create immersive universes and iconic characters that are beloved across platforms, borders, backgrounds, and generations - only made possible by building a work environment that nurtures the artistry of game development and unleashes the aspirations of our people.</em></p>
<p><em>As the Design Director of Innovation, you will be the vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations on an upcoming open-world shooter game. You stay current with the latest developments in both the indie and AAA space. David Bowie is quoted as saying, “Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting”–the idea of innovating in the deep end excites you, balanced with a pragmatic desire to turn dreams into reality that players can get their hands on and enjoy. </em><em>This role is anticipated to be a hybrid work position, with some work on-site and some work-from-home. The home studio for this position is Irvine, CA.</em></p>
<p>This isn't the first time Blizzard has attempted the creation of an open world shooter. I'm referring to project Titan, of course. The game should have been an MMO shooter, but after seven years of development, the studio was forced to cancel it. Some of its remnants were turned into Overwatch, which is, however, a session-based game.</p>
<p>More recently, Blizzard canceled another its survival game codenamed Odyssey. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> it, though. Anyway, the game reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/odyssey-blizzards-canceled-survival-game-reportedly-had-a-troubled-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered</a> from a troubled development phase. Let's hope the same thing won't happen with this new open world shooter.</p>
