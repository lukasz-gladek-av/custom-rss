			<p>The Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 official PC system requirements have been shared online today, detailing what players will require to run the second entry in the system at various resolutions, framerates and quality settings.</p>
<p>To run the game at 1080p resolution, 30 frames per second, players will need an Intel i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU, GTX 1060 (6 GB), or RX 580, and 16 GB RAM. As the target resolution and framerate increase, so do the requirements, and to run Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 at either 1440p at 60 FPS or 2160p at 30 FPS, players will need an Intel i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, RTX 4080 or RX 7900 XT GPU and 32 GB RAM. Judging from the system requirements, it definitely looks like the game will be rather CPU-intensive, which is not surprising, considering what its predecessor did.</p>

On PlayStation 5 Pro, the game will run at upscaled 2160p resolution with PSSR and unlocked 60 FPS.</p>

			<p>Eternal Strands got an official announcement date today during the PC Gaming Show. Yellow Brick Games announced that this title will be launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a> on January 28, 2025. The game will also be available via Game Pass. During this announcement, the developer also revealed that the game will be in collaboration with Square Enix's Creative Studio III, which is the developer of Final Fantasy XIV Online and Final Fantasy XVI. They will be collaborating to design original content for the game after the launch. The first post-launch update has been confirmed to be free, and we will be adding a new Epic creature, as well as new weapons and armor for players to experiment with and utilize. These will be designed in collaboration with Creative Studio III's lead artist, Yusuke Mogi, who is the artist behind Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
<p>Along with this announcement, Yellow Brick Games released a trailer that shows what the aerial Epic will look like, and the collaboration will be used to push the boundaries of the existing combat system in Eternal Strands while having that reminiscent feeling of content created by Creative Studio III. This title is being developed on<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-rtx-4080/"> Unreal Engine 5</a>, which has the potential to have stunning graphics, but so far, games that have been released using this engine have suffered from a lot of optimization and stuttering issues, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who are hearing about this game for the first time, it's the debut title from Dragon Age veteran Mike Laidlaw at the new gaming studio Yellow Brick Games. Laidlaw was the Lead Director and Designer of Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Inquisition.</p>
<p>Also announced along with the release date of the game is the voice cast of the main characters that you'll see in Eternal Strands, which includes iconic voice actors such as Amelia Tyler, who will be the voice of the Surgeborn. The game is shaping up to have a lot of fun features, as you will be able to climb nearly everything in the game while exploring the vast world that experiences extreme weather with a dynamic day and night cycle. You'll also get to forge bonds with your Weaver Band, which are the companions that will support you on your expedition.</p>
<p>You'll also get to experiment with fun elemental systems, such as Frost, Flame, and Kinetic magic, which will allow you to burn or freeze your enemies while getting to use fun physics play to throw stuff at your enemies.</p>
<p>Make sure to check out the trailer for Eternal Strands above.</p>

			<p>At the PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025, 11 bit studios announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-is-a-mysterious-new-sci-fi-game-from-11-bit-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a> will be released sometime in 2025 for PCs and consoles, launching on Game Pass from day one. Meanwhile, the developers have also just released a free demo that lets gamers check out the intriguing sci-fi survival game right now.</p>
<p>While the basic premise of crash-landing on a hostile world is not at all new, the rest of it is. In The Alters, as suggested by the title, protagonist Jan manufactures alternate versions of himself that originate from decisions he made in the past. These Alters help him repair the mobile base towards the ultimate goal of getting the hell out of that blasted planet, but dealing with them isn't always easy, as they have their own personalities and needs.</p>
<p>In an interview with Wccftech from last May, Lead Designer Rafał Włosek <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> the inspiration for The Alters:</p>
<p><em>There was a lot of brainstorming in general, but we always had this idea about creating a game about how our lives could go if we made different decisions. This was slowly getting more and more concrete when we were talking about it and finally figured out that we wanted to have a game where the player could actually experience meeting a different version of himself who&nbsp;made this different decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Then we thought it would work great in a sci-fi environment, where you could use many different sci-fi technologies to achieve&nbsp;effects that are not so easily achieved in real life, for example. And then, well, there was also this idea about making copies of your own self and interacting with them.</em></p>

<p>Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got to play it</a> and became a lot more interested in the game following the hands-on session.</p>
<p><em>All in all, I'm interested. I started my time at 11 Bit studios with nothing. No knowledge, hype, or excitement for The Alters. I left with a game that I am looking forward to and fully intend to play, either reviewing it or purchasing it upon release. If that isn't a sign of something, nothing is.</em></p>

			<p>The French studio Hawkswell has announced the Celtic-inspired CRPG Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/five-games-you-should-check-out-from-the-pc-gaming-show-2020/">PC Gaming Show</a>. This title is their first title, and was revealed using a presentation trailer that mixed in some pre0alpha in-engine footage alongside some in-game sequences to show audiences what they can expect from the game. To be able to develop this game and finish it off, the studio is seeking support from players via a crowdfunding campaign that will take place in Q1 2025, which will lead to an expansion of the content already in Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna. The plan is to use the funding to be able to expand on the planned number of player choices made in the game, and the impact that their choices will have on the player and other characters in the game.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSrI3-p1CCg</p>
<p>In Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna, you play as Finn, an orphan child who has otherworldly powers. They are the newest recruit for Fianna, and Finn will work their way up to rise and become their leader. This game takes place in the kingdom of Tara, which deals with internal struggles as well as an ancient dark force that lies beneath their land. Players will have to take control of their Fianna warband and lead them through tactical battles while also managing relationships with five unique Companions while working to unlock the power of legendary weapons that are tied to ancient heroes.</p>
<p>In this game, players will be able to choose to participate in turn-based combat. Alternatively, if you prefer to be a pacifist, you can try and use negotiation, charm or intimidation to get through otherwise difficult battles. As with many CRPGs, Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna will have a lot of replayability, which will allow the player to choose to do multiple playthroughs to make different choices and get new endings.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're interested in, you are able to add Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2718100/Legends_of_Awen_Rise_of_The_Fianna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam wishlist</a> now, where you'll be able to see some more in-depth details about the upcoming Celtic-inspired CRPG and what is in store for you if you decide to play it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Caves of Qud Leaves Early Access After 15 Years, Announced At PC Gaming Show]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/caves-of-qud-leaves-early-access-after-15-years-announced-at-pc-gaming-show/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/caves-of-qud-leaves-early-access-after-15-years-announced-at-pc-gaming-show.1053231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/caves-of-qud-leaves-early-access-after-15-years-announced-at-pc-gaming-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As you can guess by the title, Caves of Qud isn't a new game in the slightest. In fact, the game has been available for people to play for about 15 years now, as it's been sat in Early Access since it was announced. This game is well-loved by those who enjoy a roguelike, and Freehold Games announced today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that Caves of Qud has finally experienced a 1.0 launch and is now available for sale on Steam, Itch.io, and GOG.</p>
<p>Caves of Qud is a bit of an outlier in the roguelike category, making it a little bit difficult to put it into one box fully. The game is massive and generates a world full of challenging biomes, including ruins, settlements, and jungles set out to kill you. The game is advertised as a "Science fantasy roguelike epic" as well as a "Deep simulation," which is pretty accurate, as players have free reign in the game. This includes arguing with NPCs and getting into brawls with the most unlikely enemies.</p>
<p>With the release of the 1.0 update, Caves of Qud finally receives a tutorial, which explains the basics of the game to newcomers and to those who want to dip their toes back into the game but may have forgotten how it all works. That's not all, as there is a new final quest in the main questline that initiates the end of the game, along with new music, items, and 40 new achievements for those who enjoy achievement hunting and collecting absolutely everything in the game.</p>
<p>Alongside the 1.0 launch of the game comes the Dromade Deluxe Edition of the game, which includes an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack that can unlock some in-game pets right at the start of the game.</p>
<p>One unfortunate note that the development team at Freehold Games has made is that save files prior to 1.0 won't be compatible with the full version of the game. However, if players find that they want to continue with their old saves, they will be able to switch over to the legacy branch in the Betas menu <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For those wanting to purchase the game, it will cost you $30, but there is currently a 15% discount until December 12. Although it's now fully launched, Freehold Games has said that they have planned more content to add to the game and will share details of that at a later date.</p>
