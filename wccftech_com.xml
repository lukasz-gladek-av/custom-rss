			<p>A Quake III Arena remaster may be in the works by Nightdive Studios, judging from a not-so-subtle tease from the developer itself.</p>



<p>As spotted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/quake/">Quake series subreddit</a>, the developer has pinned a comment on its livestream that reads: <em>"All eyes, I mean Orbbs, will be on that announcement."</em> For those not in the know, Orbbs is the name of one of the bots available in Quake III Arena for offline play, so the developer pinning this comment definitely sounds like a tease for one of their upcoming announcement.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remaster-experts-nightdive-studios-stand-ready-to-take-on-remastering-ps3-and-xbox-360-games/">Nightdive Studios</a> working on a Quake III Arena remaster wouldn't be surprising at all, considering how the development studio has brought several classic first-person shooters like System Shock to modern platforms and has worked with other developers to modernize classics with new content, including the first entry in the Quake series. Unlike these other titles, however, Quake III Arena is a multiplayer-focused title, so it will be very interesting to see how the studio will go about remastering one of the most influential competitive first-person shooters ever made.</p>



<p>Quake III Arena was launched back in 1999 on PC, and, despite being very different from its predecessor, it's regarded as one of the finest FPS ever released. With its multiplayer-only formula that did away with a traditional single-player campaign, the third entry in the series by id Software has influenced countless competitive FPS games, including Unreal Tournament and even more modern games like Overwatch. Hopefully, soon enough, even those who never had the chance to try the game out will be able to see for themselves how the game changed first-person shooters as a whole back in the day.</p>

			<p>THQ Nordic <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has already sold more than 300K units in less than three days since its early access debut on PC, where the game is available via Steam or the Epic Games Store. So far, user reviews submitted on Steam are positive, with 84% of the nearly 6K reviews entered so far giving the game a thumbs up. </p>



<p>According to Grimlore Games, this version of Titan Quest II includes around 15 hours of content. The full version is expected to be available in around a year; however, once the game gets to version 1.0, the price will be raised to $49.99 / €49.99. Those who wish to join the early access can do so at a discounted price of $29.99 / €29.99, and from now through August 8, there is another 20% discount to bring the price down to $23.99 / €23.99.</p>



<p>Grimlore plans to add new masteries, new content, and new world segments, stories, and quests, as well as new features to enhance the game’s longevity, such as crafting. These new features and content will be released through early access as soon as they are ready. Smaller updates, such as bug fixes, balancing, and minor polish updates, are expected to go live monthly, though they can be skipped if nothing major is needed. Major updates, adding significant new features, mechanics, and/or content, will be released roughly every three months. The studio will also introduce translations to the game during the early access period, as currently, there's only English.</p>

<p>As usual with early access games, Titan Quest II will only launch on consoles like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X once that phase is over and version 1.0 is ready to deploy on PC.</p>
