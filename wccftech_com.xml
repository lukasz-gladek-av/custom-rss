			<p>The Fortnite Unreal Editor will soon be expanded with new tools and IPs, including Squid Game and Star Wars.</p>
<p>During today's State of Unreal presentation, Epic provided an overview of what is coming to UEFN, which has proven to be extremely popular, with players having spent over 11.2 billion hours across 260,000 live creator-made islands since its release two years ago. To make the Editor even more enticing for developers, new tools and IPs are coming soon, starting with the LEGO Brick Editor coming on June 17th, creation elements inspired by Squid Game on June 27th, the same day the third and final season of the show debuts on Netflix worldwide, and Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars, both launching on yet to be confirmed release dates.</p>
<p>Based on the technology that powered the AI-powered Darth Vader seen during the latest Season of Fortnite Battle Royale: GALACTIC BATTLE, new tools for the creation of similar NPCs will be coming to the Fortnite Unreal Editor later this year. Creators will be able to use the new Persona Device to create characters with full-blown personalities that players can interact with. Another AI tool coming to UEFN is the Epic Developer Assistant, which is actually already available in beta on the Epic Developer Community. The AI-powered assistant will help creators write Verse code that can be used in UEFN projects while also providing ideas, workflow guidance, and more to speed up the Fortnite island development process.</p>
<p>The last new Fortnite Unreal Editor feature coming soon is Scene Graph, which is launching in beta on June 7th, and is setting out to become the new foundational layer for UEFN. More information on Scene Graph and every other addition outlined above can be found<a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/state-of-unreal-2025-highlights-for-fortnite-creators?team=personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here.</a></p>
<p>Besides providing updates on the future of the Fortnite Unreal Editor, today's State of Unreal also provided a first in-game look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a> and confirmed the core features of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>, which is now available.</p>

<p>We've been covering Pioner for several years now and also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the developers twice.

Even if you can't play next week, GFA Games confirmed that an Open Beta will take place later this Summer.</p>
