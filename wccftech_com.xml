			<p>CI Games, the studio behind the Lords of the Fallen games, has permanently lowered the price of the 2023 Lords of the Fallen title, which was previously available for $69.99 USD on consoles and $59.99 USD on PC. Now, the price is $29.99 USD / €29.99 / £24.99 for the standard edition on all platforms, with the deluxe edition lowered to $39.99 USD / €39.99 / £34.99.</p>



<p>This also isn't just a cut to the 2023 Lords of the Fallen. The entire CI Games catalogue of titles is getting a permanent price cut, with all of the studio's previous games now listed at $29.99 USD / €29.99 / £24.99 or lower.</p>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1951319064116179355">X</a>, the chief executive officer of CI Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-developer-ci-games-boss-claims-he-has-data-that-proves-modern-audience-is-a-false-myth/">Marek Tyminski</a>, cites the price of physical copies dropping in retail stores as one of the reasons for the digital versions getting cheaper, and also claims it to be part of the studio's "<em>player first</em>" approach.</p>



<p>"<em>Keeping games full price on digital stores while physical copies drop is wrong. Ironically, physical costs more per unit to make and sell. Big discounts from inflated prices look better — but that’s not real value.</em> <em>We’re slashing prices across the entire CI Games catalog — and we’re committed to keeping it that way. Fair pricing. Players first.</em>"</p>

<p>When Lords of the Fallen launched in 2023, it did so in a poor state, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">with our reviewer,</a> Francesco De Meo, saying that he "<em>was disappointed to see how the game failed to deliver an enjoyable experience. Some die-hard Souls series fans may find some enjoyment in the 35 or so hours-long journey to save Mournstead, but everyone else likely won't be able to see past the game's many shortcomings."</em></p>



<p>A 2.0 update that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">arrived earlier this year</a> marked a huge improvement, and the game has still been able to surpass <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-reaches-more-than-5-5-million-players/">5.5 million players since launch</a>, but it's definitely not been the journey that Tyminski and the rest of CI Games would have envisioned. </p>



<p>At least the price cuts are a tangible way for CI Games to show its players that it is committed to giving them a product that is worth what they paid for it.</p>
