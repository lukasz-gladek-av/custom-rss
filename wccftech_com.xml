			<p>Dreamhaven, the studio behind the PvP shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504780/Wildgate/">Wildgate</a>, which goes between boots-on-the-ground first-person shooting and ship-to-ship battle, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-out-now-ps5-xbox-series-pc/">launched this past July 22</a>, has suffered layoffs, chief executive officer Mike Morhaime confirmed in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-morhaime-1081a7170_today-i-want-to-share-some-difficult-news-activity-7369069584328421376-7-qL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dreamhaven-affected-by-unspecified-number-of-layoffs">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>.</p>



<p>Morhaime doesn't confirm how many of Dreamhaven's developers were impacted by the layoff, but does say that the layoffs have mostly impacted its publishing group, and that they were "<em>talented colleagues who have played a key role in building Dreamhaven’s foundation and supporting what has been an eventful year for us</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From organizing the Dreamhaven Showcase to helping launch three games, every person at Dreamhaven has contributed to sharing our games with the world. I’m deeply grateful for the creativity, dedication, and hard work of the teammates we are parting ways with. They will be truly missed</em>," Morhaime writes.</p>



<p>Morhaime continues to say that the mission for Wildgate and Dreamhaven "<em>remains unchanged</em>," and that he remains "<em>optimistic about Dreamhaven’s future and the experiences still to come</em>."</p>



<p>Dreamhaven is comprised of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-first-look-and-hands-on-a-sci-fi-sea-of-thieves-by-former-blizzard-devs/">Blizzard and Sea of Thieves developers,</a> which helps to contextualize the games' back-and-forth from first-person shooting to ship-to-ship battle. When we checked it out in a preview earlier this year, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo called it "<em>a blast of fun</em>," and that "<em>The art style is definitely very reminiscent of Blizzard's work, but in terms of gameplay, it reminded me a lot of a sci-fi version of Rare's Sea of Thieves</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Roblox has partnered with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to swap out its current maturity rating system for the games on its platform, or what Roblox calls 'experiences,' with age ratings commonly used on individually sold games, like ESRB, PEGI, GRAC, and USK ratings. The company will also require <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">players to verify their age</a> to use in-game chat by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Players in North America will see ESRB ratings, while players in Europe and the United Kingdom will see PEGI, USK in Germany, and GRAC in the Republic of Korea.</p>



<p>It's another layer to Roblox finally trying to do more to address the issues of adult predators using the platform to target children, an issue that's been <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">reported</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY&amp;t=1030s">multiple times</a> over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ">the years</a>. Last month, Louisiana's attorney general, Liz Murril, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Roblox for failing to implement proper safety protocols to protect children from those who've been able to abuse the platform and its lax security for years. Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">responded to the lawsuit</a>, calling the claims "<em>erroneous</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>With so many families engaging with Roblox, it is hugely beneficial to provide parents with trusted and familiar ratings no matter where they live</em>," said Patricia Vance, ESRB president and IARC chairperson, per a report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-partners-with-international-age-rating-coalition-to-replace-current-maturity-labels">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>The globally streamlined process will provide Roblox creators with an efficient and proven process for obtaining age and content ratings, while informing parents of what their kids may experience before they play.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we're announcing our plan to roll out platform-wide age estimation, designed to set a new standard for online safety. Learn more about the 100+ safety initiatives we shipped this year: <a href="https://t.co/KRIpYzwCVG">https://t.co/KRIpYzwCVG</a></p>— Roblox (@Roblox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1963300638219223482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>Regarding the age verification, Roblox will use a combination of ID age verification, parental consent, and facial age estimation technology to get a more accurate read on a users age, instead of what it's been doing so far, "<em>simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account</em>," writes chief safety officer, Matt Kaufman.</p>



<p>Kaufman also writes that Roblox has issued "<em>over 100 safety</em> <em>initiatives</em>" since the start of this year, and that these new implementations are building on an already "<em>strong foundation</em>" of protocols Roblox already had in place.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg</a> reported that Roblox had over 13,000 incidents of child exploitation on the platform in 2023, and that employees who had worked with Kaufman claimed Roblox was "<em>on its back foot</em>" in its struggle to clear the platform of predators.</p>
