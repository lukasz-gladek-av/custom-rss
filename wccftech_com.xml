			<p>As FromSoftware continues working on Elden Ring Nightreign, the Japanese development studio is also hard at work on The Duskbloods, which reportedly is a game the developer has spent time on fine tuning gameplay the most.</p>



<p>As reported in a new video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ziostorm">Ziostorm</a>, a Chinese journalist who provided accurate information on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a> before the game's release, recently revealed some small, exciting tidbits about FromSoftware's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. The game was reportedly greenlit even before the marketing campaign for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> started, and it is the game that FromSoftware has spent the most time on gameplay among all of their games.</p>



<p>All the time spent on prototyping The Duskbloods' gameplay is reportedly paying off, as the game, although PvEvP, features many innovative gameplay elements that the team is really proud of. So much so that the journalist speculates the game could influence games from other studios as much as the aforementioned Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice did, especially with the parry mechanics that are now prevalent in almost every action game.</p>



<p>Besides providing this small bit of information on The Duskbloods, the known Chinese journalist also revealed that we should see more of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/">Elden Ring Nightreign DLC, The Forsaken Hollow</a>, soon. Apparently, three more trailers should be released before the game launches on December 4 to showcase the two new Nightfarers - the Scholar and the Undertaker - and the new content in a final launch trailer. As the expansion is nearing release, these trailers, if they are indeed coming, shouldn't be more than a few days away.</p>

<p><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">When it was revealed during the first Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Direct ever earlier this year</a>, many, including myself, jumped at the screen at the first footage of The Duskbloods, as the game looked like a sequel to the beloved <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/bloodborne/">Bloodborne</a>. However, the Switch 2 exclusive is going to be a much different game, having been built from the ground up as a multiplayer experience, which left a few disappointed, as FromSoftware is primarily known for its single-player experiences with multiplayer elements sprinkled on top.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the game's supposed innovative gameplay elements will make it a compelling experience for all fans of the studio, possibly turning doubters' opinions around as much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign did for me when it launched earlier this year on PC and consoles.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher tinyBuild has announced that the indie single player first-person shooter game FEROCIOUS will be released on December 4 for PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645630/FEROCIOUS/?mc_cid=5e1f5669c5&amp;mc_eid=728a334a9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>FEROCIOUS, powered by Unity, is the debut game of OMYOG, a small studio that features the expertise of both AAA game and film veterans. Leonard Saalfrank, inspired by King Kong, leads the vision, while Mark, ex-Far Cry and Battlefront II director, brings sandbox-level design expertise. Writers like Jörg Ihle and Dominik Hochwald add narrative depth from film, games, and theme parks.</p>



<p>In FEROCIOUS, players will find themselves stranded on a dangerous island and forced to survive against mercenaries, dinosaurs, and a vibrant yet hostile ecosystem. At every turn, they must face challenges in the form of savage predators, treacherous terrain, and limited resources. Careful exploration is vital to uncover hidden paths, secrets and essential gear. Furthermore, as shown in the release date trailer (embedded below), there's a twist in that a so-called 'dino control device' lets you turn the dinosaurs to your side, so that they might be used to attack enemies, open paths, or infiltrate guarded areas. </p>



<p>The lore explanation is that it scans the creature's brain and reproduces its vocal signals, not unlike what was shown in Jurassic Park 3, but with the usage of ultrasonic calls that only the lizards can hear. Once scanned, the player can get a dinosaur to follow them, move to a particular spot, attack a target, break obstacles, or even fetch items. The commands depend on the species; some are more obedient (or smarter) than others. Not every dinosaur in the game will be controllable, though.</p>

<p>TinyBuild did not share the pricing yet, but given that it's an indie game, we expect it to be priced accordingly. The Steam page also includes the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for FEROCIOUS, by the way.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i5 4th Gen or AMD equivalent<br>Memory: 12 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 580<br>DirectX: Version 11<br>Storage: 25 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i7 or Ryzen 5 3600 and up<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD RX 5600<br>DirectX: Version 11<br>Storage: 25 GB available space</p>

<p>Following the mixed reception to its debut title, the free-to-play arena shooter game The Finals, Embark Studios returns stronger than ever with ARC Raiders, a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter title. Here's an overview of everything we know about this game.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> before The Finals, during The Game Awards 2021. Back then, Embark conceived it as a free-to-play cooperative (PvE) third-person shooter game, but it was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked to be a buy-to-play PvPvE game</a>. This, of course, meant a delay over the original plan. </p>



<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, Embark finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the final launch date: October 30, 2025. The game is available in two purchase options. The Standard Edition is priced at $39.99. For those seeking extras, a Deluxe Edition is offered at $59.99. This version of the game provides 2,400 Raider Tokens (used as in-game currency) as well as "The Wanderer" Pack, which includes the Valente Outfit, Pathfinder Backpack, and Blanket Roll. Inside the game, there are paid options for cosmetic-only purchases and battle pass-style content via Raider Tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>As mentioned briefly earlier, the final version of ARC Raiders is a third-person PvPvE extraction shooter. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic Earth, with the devastated landscape specifically centered on the Italian coast. Humanity has been forced to retreat underground after a catastrophic event: an invasion by ARC units, mysterious mechanical enemies that descended from orbit in overwhelming numbers. The few survivors now huddle in the subterranean city of Toledo in the District of Speranza and surface only when necessary to scavenge and survive among the ruins above.</p>



<p>Arguably, what really sets ARC Raiders apart visually is its retro-futuristic vision, blending Cold War analog tech with advanced robotics and rich atmospheric detail. The world is streaked with neon, battered by fog and synth-heavy soundscapes, and every corner tells a story of a society that once was.</p>



<p>Just like most extraction shooters, ARC Raiders does not feature a traditional story campaign. The game does, however, include narrative bits that the players can discover through environmental clues, NPC interactions, and evolving background quests. Players are "Raiders," those few resourceful survivors that risk the dangers of the topside in search of loot (mechanically) and answers, such as what happened with the ARC invasion and the fate of Earth's vanished elite. </p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The core gameplay experience of ARC Raiders revolves around raiding, scavenging, and ultimately extracting. Each expedition on the surface is a tense, half-hour race against time, as players band together in squads of three or two players (although it is also possible to queue solo) to delve into dangerous zones, whose environments range from crumbling cities and derelict bunkers to the rusting debris of fallen spacecraft.</p>



<p>Players must carefully navigate the post-apocalyptic maps, being wary of both the hostile ARC robots and other human players who are also hunting the same vital resources. Tactics, aim, and squad coordination are essential, not least because at any moment a failed fight can mean the loss of everything not safely stored. The game’s extraction mechanic adds another strategic layer, requiring Raiders to find and reach specific extraction points before time—or luck—runs out. Extraction can be accomplished via elevators, metro stations, or secure hatches that require special keys and offer safer withdrawal, but each method presents its own risk and reward trade-offs.</p>



<p>The constant tension of loss and reward is what drives progression. Upon a successful extraction, teams return with valuable materials and equipment, which can be used to upgrade gear and base facilities for future runs. Anything not successfully extracted is, however, forfeit. Collaboration is therefore both supported and encouraged, as squads must rely on careful coordination to contend with unpredictable PvP encounters and environmental hazards, ranging from dynamic enemy spawns to changing weather and toxic zones. Notably, the game features a "Match Journey" system, which chronicles the story of each run.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to deliver its sophisticated visuals. The PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-geforce-rtx-50-series-bundle-available-game-supports-dlss4-rtxgi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports NVIDIA's RTX Global Illumination, DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Multi Frame Generation, and Reflex</a>. The game also supports AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1, Intel XeSS 1.3, TAAU, TSR, and AMD FSR Frame Generation.</p>
