			<p>Gamescom 2025 is only days away from kicking off at the time of this writing, which also means we're only days away from Gamescom Opening Night Live, the presentation hosted by Geoff Keighley that starts the annual convention every year with a bevy of announcements and trailers for upcoming titles.</p>



<p>While Keighley would never spill all the beans regarding what will be at the showcase, he has highlighted a few of the games that we already know will be there, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-open-levels-capcom-worked-improve-performance/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-a-similar-sized-map-to-tsushima-but-it-has-been-designed-to-feel-larger/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, to name a few.</p>



<p>We'll also get a look at the upcoming season of the Fallout TV show, which has its second season set to premiere sometime in December 2025, though a specific release date has yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Beyond what Keighley's mentioned here, we also know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-gamescom-2025/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will be featured at Gamescom 2025, and will potentially, finally, get its release date announced after what's felt like an extremely long wait for any concrete news on the game's release.</p>



<p>Just prior to the publication of this post, a rumor from Billbil-kun at Dealabs surfaced, claiming that Sony will announce a new Inzone headset, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-h9-ii-headset-reveal-at-gamescom-2025-onl/">Inzone H9 II</a>.</p>



<p>Attendees at the convention will also get to go hands-on with the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, which should also have its release date revealed during the Opening Night Live presentation, as well. Pearl Abyss' <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">Crimson Desert will again be at this year's show</a>, after the game was recently delayed out of 2025.</p>



<p>As far as what won't be there, Embark Studios has come out to say that it won't be taking part in the festivities with its upcoming shooter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-wont-have-another-playtest-before-launch-embark-studios/">ARC Raiders</a>, but beyond that, we'll have to wait and see what doesn't make an appearance during ONL to know who decided to skip out on the event.</p>



<p>You'll be able to watch the approximately two-hour presentation live on YouTube and other major platforms when it premieres on Tuesday, August 19, at 11 am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST.</p>

			<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/sony-inzone-h9-ii-une-nouvelle-version-du-casque-gaming-sans-fil-arrive-bientot-60393">Billbil-kun on Dealabs</a>, Sony is set to reveal a new headset in its Inzone lineup of accessories at Gamescom 2025, with the Inzone H9 II, the successor to 2022's Inzone H9, potentially being announced during Gamescom 2025's ONL Showcase.</p>



<p>The Inzone line of accessories was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-monitors-headsets-accessories-evo-2022/">first launched in 2022,</a> with Sony releasing headphones and monitors and then showcasing them during EVO 2022. We've already had a follow-up release of monitors, with Sony releasing OLED variants of its Inzone monitor line.</p>



<p>Dealabs also includes a spec chart for the new rumored H9 II headphones, which shows a few significant changes like the new model having a detachable mic, support for the latest Bluetooth standard, and weighing far less than the original H9 headphones.</p>

<p>As far as price is concerned, Dealabs reports that the H9 II headphones will set you back <strong>€349.99</strong>, with pre-orders set to go live when its revealed during Gamescom ONL. Dealabs doesn't include a specific release date prediction, but does suggest that it'll be out sometime in early September.</p>



<p>While it's important to remember that all of this information is, at the time of this writing, not verified and still a rumor, Billbil-kun and Dealabs have built a strong reputation for accurately reporting retail information ahead of official announcements.</p>



<p>We'll know by this time next week if their reputation continues to be just as strong.</p>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country arrived on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC a week ago at the time of this writing, and according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">new report from data firm Sensor Tower</a>, Hangar 13's latest entry in the series has sold more than <strong>800K copies</strong> in its first week.</p>



<p>That figure is across all platforms, but according to Sensor Tower, 48% of those copies were sold on PlayStation. </p>



<p>"<em>The robust early sales underline the enduring appeal of the Mafia IP and validate the studio’s choice to deliver a linear, narrative-driven experience with cinematic presentation</em>," writes Sensor Tower on LinkedIn.</p>



<p>"<em>The stronger performance on PlayStation may reflect the platform’s strategic alignment with story-focused single-player games.</em>"</p>



<p>Some other first-week stats shared by Hangar 13 show that players have already "<em>dispatched</em>" more than 185 million in-game enemies, and fired over 600 million shots.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Family has been busy:</p><p>💥 600 million shots fired<br>💎 10 billion Dinari "earned"<br>🗡️ 185 million enemies "dispatched"<br>🚑 17 million bandages used </p><p>Thanks for an amazing first week in the Old Country! <a href="https://t.co/JtjgmV74ng">pic.twitter.com/JtjgmV74ng</a></p></div>— Mafia Game (@mafiagame) <a href="https://twitter.com/mafiagame/status/1956053234369405367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's all together a good start for the game, though we'll see if 2K and Hangar 13 will be able to keep up the momentum going forward. The studio is already working to add requested features from players, as Hangar 13 also confirmed that the ability to 'Free Ride' in the map is on its way, along with "<em>new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months</em>."</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Mafia: The Old Country for us, </a>and enjoyed his time with it, despite not being able to explore the Sicilian countryside as much as he would have liked, writing in his review, "<em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot."</em></p>
