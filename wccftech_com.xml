			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will address one of the most critical issues of its predecessor, which caused slowdowns in certain games.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/the-nintendo-switch-limited-cpu-and-ram-but-it-also-made-optimization-a-fun-puzzle-to-figure-out-japanese-engineers-talk-about-difficulties-they-faced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUTOMATON</a> recently interviewed some Japanese developers who worked on ports for the original Switch, asking them what difficulties they had to face and what are their expectations for its successor. Speaking about the CPU, the most frequent comment from developers was that it was often running at full capacity in games and thus couldn't handle background loading, forcing developers to either optimize background loading to make it happen whenever possible or to abandon optimization entirely, leading to performance drops in games. The much more powerful CPU of the Nintendo Switch 2 will address this issue, making background loading easier for developers.</p>
<p>Another well-documented weakness of the original system, which the Nintendo Switch 2 will address, is the RAM, as its measly 4 GB made it difficult for some developers to port games developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which had 8GB of RAM. One developer who worked on a port of an open-world RPG said that working around the RAM limitations of the system was like solving a puzzle, as compressing textures to the absolute limit to save as much memory as possible actually made their game look better the more memory was saved.</p>
<p>No matter what individual game developers' expectations may be, the vast majority of them are really looking forward to the Nintendo Switch 2's improved hardware specifications. Those working primarily on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S titles, in particular, highlighted the urgent need for the system, as its increased specs will make porting games much easier.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch later this year. According to analysts, it should be priced at<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-399/"> $399</a> for a variety of reasons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-ceo-is-not-forcing-teams-to-work-on-live-service-games-shuhei-yoshida-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite what the live service push announced some time ago, PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst is reportedly not forcing teams to develop live service games.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great"> Push Square</a>, former PlayStation Studios CEO Shuhei Yoshida spoke with Sacred Symbols+ about the now infamous live service push that has yet to produce any result, saying that, to his knowledge, first-party studios are not being forced by current CEO Hermen Hulst to develop live service games, although the big initiative did in some way push studios to work on this type of game. According to Yoshida-san, when studios see the company has a big initiative, riding on it gives them a better chance to get a project approved and supported.</p>
<p>Among the games that were part of the PlayStation Studios' live service push but were eventually canceled was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-online-devs-tease-their-canceled-game-it-was-the-highlight-of-my-career/">The Last of Us Online</a>. During the interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacerd Symbols+</a>, Shuhei Yoshida confirmed he had played the game and that it was great. However, after a conversation with Bungie, Naughty Dog realized they couldn't support a live service game and work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Project</a> at the same time, so they canceled the project to focus on the single-player game.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, PlayStation Studios' live service push has yet to produce any results. Last year's Concord was a complete failure, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">going offline shortly after launch</a>, while other projects that were part of the initiative, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War game by Bluepoint</a>, have been canceled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Wccftech was recently invited out to meet with the leads of Studio Jade to get an exclusive early look at the Black Hawk Down campaign set to become part of the complete Delta Force experience later this year. Alongside a small group of fellow media broken up into three-man squads, we had boots on the ground to get a first look at two of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/">Delta Force Black Hawk Down</a> campaign's early chapters.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The Black Hawk Down campaign is intended to be a much more masochistic take on the title’s tactical gunplay, and the developers intended for this co-op experience to require true cooperation to succeed. After picking one of the four pre-made operators, I had a limited selection of loadouts to choose from with no ability to customize and mix/match weapons and attachments. In the group Q&amp;A following our session, I inquired if the Gunsmith system, which is a core part of the Delta Force multiplayer, would be considered to customize a pre-mission load out and was told by the developers that the amount of planning and procedure would run antithetical to the type of narrative they’re pushing in Black Hawk Down and the scramble of boots on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span>Because ammo and consumables are so scarce, bringing along an operator who can resupply fellow teammates is all but essential. While I initially thought that bringing a shotgun would work great for close-range encounters with its one-shot-ill potential, I instead started gravitating towards bringing along the heaviest machine gun I could manage with the highest ammo count. Headshots are almost always an instant kill in the multiplayer session I joined, so it made more sense to bring a weapon with the highest ammo count and carefully pick my shots to snipe enemies from out of their line of sight and hopefully make it through most of the stage without even needing to reload.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Gunfights are typically lethal for the side that comes in unprepared in Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. Most of my team’s early deaths were from not checking corners or opening a door only to find an enemy soldier with an assault rifle on the other side. While the enemies are incredibly deadly, I’m grateful that there are times when the AI is as dumb as a box of rocks. Sometimes the enemies could have laser precision, while other times I found they’d have their backs turned, allowing me a free shot before every other enemy within earshot would home in on my position and blast me away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We only got a brief taste of two of the campaign missions to Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down campaign, but both had distinctly different gameplay loops. The first mission was a hostage rescue where, after being delivered to the roof of an abandoned apartment building, our squad had to proceed down to ground level, navigate through some open streets, and make it to a large multilevel building filled with enemy ambushes and hostages in dire need of rescue. Line of sight and vantage points played a major part in the latter section as enemies vastly outnumbered our modest squad, and any gunfights in the open would cause other enemies to swarm in. While I initially thought grenades would be an efficient way to take out groups of enemies hiding in rooms across the pavilion, I learned the hard way that one of these rooms held the hostages we were trying to rescue when we were met with a game over screen during our best run to date.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The other mission involved rescuing a Black Hawk helicopter that'd been, well, downed with enemy soldiers converging on its location. This was the first mission where we had an active time limit and had to play a bit more aggressively instead of moving from cover to cover. This was made increasingly difficult with the level being set up across scattered clusters of favelas with wide open streets that required constant awareness and changing the field of engagement from close quarters to long-range sniping at a constant shift. Our group took no less than three attempts to try and make our way toward the downed chopper and each time we were eliminated less than halfway from the goal, most often from a sniper hiding on one of the rooftops that we could never get a proper line of sight on to take out. I’m sure, with a bit more time to learn the layouts and anticipate these obstacles, clearing the campaign might get a little easier, but still not a walk in the park.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down is a drastic shift in both technology and pacing from the multiplayer experience that players might have to take a moment and recognize that they’re getting two distinct gameplay experiences in the same package. The last time I covered a multiplayer shooter that featured a distinctively different campaign was Remedy Games’ work on CrossFireX.It’s not to say that the two experiences are similar in every way, but rather the complexity of having to balance a modern-futuristic multiplayer experience with a campaign centered around Mogadishu in 1993.</span></p>

			<p>One of the best features of Nintendo has been announced that it will be discontinued. This is the Nintendo Gold Points program, where you would be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/six-weeks-of-activities-discounts-rewards-start-today-on-nintendo-switch/"> accrue Gold Points</a> with digital or physical purchases you made for the Nintendo Switch. However, it's now been announced by Nintendo that the company will be discontinuing the Gold Points program on March 24, 2025. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67660#s1q4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official statement</a> is available on the Nintendo website, where the details of the discontinuation are listed. While points won't be added to your total after March 24, you will have a year to redeem the points you've stored or 12 months from the purchase date of the item.</p>
<p>This is the typical amount of time that Gold Points were available for previously, with them expiring after a year. So, while Nintendo is discontinuing the points program, you won't lose them early. However, if you forget to use them or simply decide not to use them, they will be removed from your account after the expiration date.</p>
<p>Up until March 24, you are still able to earn Gold Points if you redeem your physical product or if you purchase a digital product. After this date, consumers won't earn Gold Points from purchasing digital content.</p>
<p>After the cut-off date, Nintendo has also noted that "some retailers may continue to sell Nintendo eShop cards that disclose earning Gold Points." However, this will not be the case. You will still be able to purchase and redeem the Nintendo eShop cards as normal, but you won't earn any Gold Points when using the cards for purchases.</p>
<p>For those who pre-ordered digital content or purchased a physical copy of a game that would typically come with Gold Points, the specified amount of Gold Points will be available for the consumers as long as the purchases and pre-orders were made before the cut-off date. Physical games that were released on or before March 24 will also still be eligible to earn the Nintendo Gold Points, even if the game was purchased after the cut-off date. However, if the game was released after the cut off date, you will not be able to get the Gold Points.</p>
<p>It's not been specified by Nintendo as to why the company has decided to discontinue the Nintendo Gold Points program, which was utilized by many. However, the Platinum Points will continue to be available, which was a significantly less beneficial program than those of the Gold Points.</p>
