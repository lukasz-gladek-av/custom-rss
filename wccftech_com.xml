			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to be a record-shattering game that will generate over $7 billion in revenue in its first 60 days of availability.</p>



<p>In a new post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">LinkedIn</a>, Josh Chapman, Managing Partner at Konvoy, an investement firm focusing on the video gaming and interactive entertainment industry, shared some predicitons on the sixth entry in the series by Rockstar Games, confirming the firm predicts that the game will generate $7.6 billion in revenue in the first 60 days of availability, and Take-Two Interactive will break even on the $2 billion investement into the game within 30 days of release. Grand Theft Auto VI is also expected to be a record-shattering game in terms of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time, player count and viewership.</p>



<p>Long before we knew when Grand Theft Auto VI would come out, many have predicted it will be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, so it will be very interesting to see if it indeed will indeed be the monumental release everyone expects it to be and if it will manage to go even beyond the boldest predictions. One of the records GTA VI already shattered, however, is likely to remain unbroken for a long time. The game's development costs will likely continue to remain the highest for an entry in the series, as Grand Theft Auto 7 is expected to cost less to make, as a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-most-expensive-gta-7-ai/">development work is going to be taken over by AI.</a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on May 26, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Implementing ray tracing in Red Dead Redemption 2 would be a bigger challenge than in Grand Theft Auto V for a few reasons, including the game's world diversity.</p>



<p>Replying to a supporter's question regarding the possibility of the rumored next-gen updated release adding ray tracing to the game, the tech expert at Digital Foundry highlighted how the possibility is there, as ray tracing getting added to Grand Theft Auto V on current generation consoles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-patch-new-ray-tracing-settings/">PC</a> suggests that it has been backported to older versions of the Rage engine. However, it could be challenging to implement ray tracing features in Red Dead Redemption 2, as the entire rendering has changed in the time between Grand Theft Auto V and the second entry of the wild west open-world series. Also, world diversity and the presence of a lot more vegetation than in GTAV add to the challenge, as the visual return would be different, as the game, for example, lacks a lot of man-made glass structures, and most of its world is green and brown, which would make bounce lighting less obvious than occlusion.</p>



<p>Even if Rockstar Games finds this challenge worthwhile, it's unlikely the entire RT suite would be implemented, and only some ray-traced effects would be a good fit, like ray-traced global illumination, which would enhance the game's use of SSAO with a static AO contribution with changes brought by the time of day. Ray-traced ambient occlusion would also be a good fit, while ray-traced shadows may not make much of a difference, as Red Dead Redemption 2 already features great shadows.</p>

<p>Despite being released in late 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2 continues to be among the best-looking open-world games ever released, so most fans would be happy to experience the game at 60 FPS on current-generation consoles even without any other visual improvement. Even in its current state, however, the game is one worth experiencing, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review.</a></p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>

			<p>The Steam publishing guidelines have been recently updated with a new clause that prevents the release of certain types of content on the platform if they violate payment processor and bank rules.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/">Automaton</a>, the Rules and Guidelines section of the Steamworks Documentation has been recently updated with a new clause that prohibits the publication of "content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steamâ€™s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers." The clause clarifies that this refers to certain kinds of adult-only content, of which there's a lot on the Valve platform. A few hours ago, SteamDB confirmed that several games that are definitely in violation of this new rule have been removed from the store, although it's still unconfirmed if their removal has anything to do with the new publishing guidelines clause.</p>



<p>As payment processors and card networks have very strict rules regarding adult content, it was only a matter of time before adult content on Steam would be impacted. Hopefully, the clause will only impact content that's in clear violation of the rule and won't be used to further limit what can be published on Steam, regardless of the presence of what is deemed adult content by a third party.</p>



<p>Besides the addition of the new clause, the rest of the Steam publishing Rules and Guidelines haven't been changed. You can check them out by going <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">here.</a></p>
