			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing some welcome new features and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>The 0.7.0 version of the emulator, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/releases/tag/v.0.7.0">here</a>, introduces, among other things, mouse and keyboard input remapping, shader recompiler fixes, gyro, and acceleration sensor handling fixes, improved compatibility with older CPUs and games powered by the Unity engine, AMD FSR and HDR support, and more. The full changelog over the previous version can be found <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/compare/v.0.6.0...v.0.7.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Even before the launch of version 0.7.0, the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator made some excellent progress in the past few weeks, as highlighted in a new video put together by BrutalSam. While Bloodborne continues to be one of the games the emulator runs best, there's been great progress in the emulation of other PlayStation 4 exclusives, including Killzone: Shadow Fall, The Last Guardian, and the original Until Dawn. These games are not exactly in a playable state due to visual glitches and performance issues, but the progress is nonetheless amazing.</p>

			<p>Unfinished builds of multiple unreleased video games, including Riot Games' first fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/">2XKO</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">Killing Floor 3</a> and P<a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/">LAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</a> are leaking online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/several-builds-of-unreleased-games-are-leaking-including-riot-games-2xko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, these unfinished builds are getting shared on an undisclosed datamining Discord server, whose members are using them for datamining purposes. As it is often in these cases, however, there's a very high chance some of these games will eventually get leaked in playable form at some point, which will definitely be unfortunate, as their early state could impact the reception the final releases will get once they are officially released. Besides 2XKO, Killing Floor 3 and PLAYERUKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, Embark Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-pvpve-extraction-game-shown-in-debut-gameplay-trailer/">ARC Raiders</a> and an early build of <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-timi-studio-goes-next-gen/">Delta Force Hawk Ops</a> have also leaked.</p>
<p>While this is setting out to be a rather big leak, it definitely does not compare to the massive Insomniac Games leak from <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-we-are-angry-and-sad-about-the-recent-criminal-cyberattack/">late 2023</a> when all sorts of information got leaked, including information on the then-unannounced <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-wip-screenshots-were-leaked/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PC port</a>, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ai-upscaling-wolverine/"> PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a> and a very early build of Marvel's Wolverine. The leak was so severe that a group of users managed to develop an unofficial port of the aforementioned Marvel's Spider-Man 2 before its official release <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">earlier this year.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-resources.1142919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-get-resources/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Among the many mechanics featured in Assassin's Creed Shadows that give you the chance to engage in activities other than sneaking around and going after assassination targets are the Hideout building and management mechanics, which allow Naoe and Yasuke to improve the League's main base of operations with new facilities that can help their war against the Shinbakufu quite a bit. To do so, however, you will need a lot of resources other than money, which could be difficult to gather by just following the main story. Considering how many are required to level up the Hideout to the maximum, you will need a solid resource-gathering strategy to maximize your efforts and prevent this side activity from being extremely tedious.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250309141630_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While there isn't a proper farming method for resources, there are some side activities you can complete over and over each season to get a lot of resources in a relatively short amount of time. The first type of this side-activity is <strong>Contracts</strong>, randomly generated short missions that can be accepted for each region of the map every season that yield different types of resources in Kakurega safehouses. These missions don't take long to complete as well, so consider clearing as many of them as possible each season to maximize your resource income.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250324113233_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another excellent method to get resources in Assassin's Creed Shadows quickly involves exploring <strong>enemy camps and strongholds</strong>. Every one of these locations is assigned a random <strong>Wealth level</strong> at the start of each season, and the higher the Wealth, the more resources you can scavenge inside the location. In addition, the vast majority of these locations feature some <strong>big resource caches</strong> hidden inside locked storerooms, which can be tagged for your scouts to collect at the end of the season. At the start of the game, you will need to use 2 scouts to get these resources, but if you level up your Stables to level 2, you will be able to reduce the number of scouts needed to get these resources to 1. As you will need to find a key to open these locked storerooms hiding all the goodies, which is done by using the Observe mechanic and checking the gold icons shown on the interface, completing smaller camps requires considerably less time than clearing the biggest castles, so if you're not also hunting for Legendary Gear, completing the smaller locations is preferred. With the Wealth level getting reset every season, you can also repeat the same camps over and over to farm resources quickly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250324114628_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Given you will need to wait for the end of the season for your scouts to collect tagged resources, and Contracts renew each season, the <strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows' resource gathering loop involves completing both the activities</strong> highlighted above to maximize the time you invest gathering resources. Complete Contracts, secure wealth from enemy camps, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/">refill your scouts</a> as needed, continue until the season ends, rinse and repeat, and you will soon sit on a mountain of resources you can use to improve your Hideout and make your time in the game easier and more enjoyable!</p>
