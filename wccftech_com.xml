			<p><strong>Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida</strong>, known as the producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XVI</strong> and the director and producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XIV</strong>, has teased a port of the popular <strong>MMORPG</strong> to <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> platforms during an in-game New Year celebration on Japanese servers. As <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/umadori0726/archives/62900051.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by the blog Livedoor, when asked about it, he replied 'Please look forward to it.' It's not quite a confirmation, but fans are taking it as a definite sign that progress is being made on that front. </p>



<p>Yoshida previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed the possibility</a> back in June 2024, when he opened the door to the port, but also suggested that it might not happen for quite some time. Now we're into 2026, though, so we might be closer to an announcement.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy XIV director then returned to the topic in a Gamescom 2025 interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, when he mused on the benefits of such a port for existing players and newcomers.</p>



<p><em>For existing Final Fantasy XIV players, if hypothetically a Nintendo Switch 2 version was released, they would have the chance, for example, going through the main story—they could play that on the PC and do raiding on the PC. But when it comes to other types of content, they could sit back, relax on the sofa with the Switch 2 in hand, and they could do their gatherer and crafter content, and I'm super excited about that sort of possibility for our players.</em></p>



<p><em>For those who have never played Final Fantasy XIV, the younger generation, if they started playing on Switch 2, being an MMO, it could be a genre new to them, and I would be really happy to introduce these new players to the genre and let them have fun with the game. It's precisely because of this that we have started discussions with Nintendo, and so far they have been positive, so I really hope that players can expect good news in the future.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, though, in the New Year message, Yoshida appears to have referenced Switch in general, rather than specifically the Switch 2. Final Fantasy XIV was originally released on the PlayStation 3, so it could certainly run on the Switch, although that platform has long since been abandoned and the latest expansions are a bit more taxing than the base game. The safest bet is to assume that the game will only launch on the Switch 2. Meanwhile, the game recently received patch 7.4, which introduced new Main Scenario Quests,​ a new dungeon, a new Trial,​ the Heavyweight Raid Tier for the Arcadion series,​ an overhaul of the Glamour System Overhaul, and a new​ Frontline map.</p>



<p>Chinese players already have a taste of playing the MMORPG on the go <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-gets-official-announcement-playtesting-begins-soon-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through the mobile version</a>, <strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Crystal World</strong>, which was developed by Tencent's LightSpeed Studios and released in China on June 19, 2025. A global launch date has not been confirmed yet.</p>

			<p>Today, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> sent the first <strong>GeForce NOW Thursday</strong> blast of the year, revealing the PC games that have entered the library this week and also those scheduled to be added throughout the whole month.</p>



<p>Let's begin with the former list. There's a new indie game that just launched, <strong>My Winter Car</strong>, and four games that have been out for some time but are now being supported by GeForce NOW. Eternights was not at all available on NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform, while the others could be streamed but only if you owned them via Steam; now, they can also be streamed if you own them via the Xbox or Epic Games stores.</p>



<ul>
<li>My Winter Car (New release on Steam, Dec. 29)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/eternights-is-an-action-game-with-dating-sim-elements-set-during-the-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eternights</a> (Epic Games Store)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> (Epic Games Store, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I continue to be a strong advocate for Don't Nod's <strong>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</strong>. If you enjoy the latest God of War games, this is one you don't want to miss. It's a little less polished, sure, but its overall quality is not that far removed from Santa Monica's acclaimed masterpieces, and it also offers a much greater degree of player agency. <strong>The Casting of Frank Stone</strong> and <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong> are also two great titles in their respective genres.</p>



<p>As for the rest of January 2026, GeForce NOW users can expect the following titles to populate their library in the coming weeks:</p>



<ul>
<li>StarRupture (New release on Steam, Jan. 6)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pathologic 3</a> (New release on Steam, Jan. 9)</li>



<li>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check (New release on Steam, Jan. 12)</li>



<li>MIO: Memories in Orbit (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass, Jan. 20)</li>



<li>Nova Roma (New release Steam, Jan. 22)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-reforged-out-december-3-controller-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars: Reforged</a> (Steam)</li>



<li>Mon Bazou (Steam)</li>



<li>Supermarket Simulator (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Tavern Keeper (Steam)</li>
</ul>



<p>Admittedly, when comparing this list with the official game release schedule, several notable titles are missing, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2XKO</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfield-beta-test-ii-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a></strong>, <strong>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein II</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/front-mission-1st-remake-to-release-this-november-front-mission-3-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Front Mission 3 Remake</a></strong>. That said, it is still possible NVIDIA will add them to GeForce NOW at a later time; the initial list announced at the beginning of each month is usually bolstered by several late additions.</p>

			<p>Over the past few days, dedicated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> fans started taking an in-depth look at the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Title Update 4</strong> files,<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/potato-mode-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-the-communitys-reaction-doesnt-disappoint/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> discovering mention of a Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong></a> and some of its potential features, including a dedicated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS profile</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">local multiplayer support</strong> with multiple consoles.</p>



<p>The idea of seeing a game that still runs poorly on many PC configuartions and other consoles was obvioulsy met with skepticism, but if you shared the community sentiment of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> being an <strong>impossible Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, you'd better think again, as newly discovered information and a screenshot simulating the graphics settings of the Switch 2 version suggest that a lot of thought is going into this new release.</p>



<p>As reported on the <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q0zjcp/more_datamined_info_regarding_the_switch_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a></strong>, a Chinese group specializing in datamining the latest entry in the <strong>CAPCOM</strong> series discovered a lot more information on the game's <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, starting with the graphics presets, which target <strong>30 FPS gameplay using NVIDIA DLSS</strong>, outputting at <strong>1080p resolution in docked mode</strong>.</p>



<p>While this is hardly surprising, considering the system's specifications, these settings won't turn the Nintendo Switch 2 version into a <strong>"Potato Mode"</strong> game. The datamining group applied these graphics settings and shared a screenshot captured from the PC version of the game, simulating how the Switch 2 version will look.</p>



<p>And the results are <strong>definitely promising</strong>, especially if similar care is given to the handheld mode profile. This version of the game would also finally provide a <strong>proper on-the-go option</strong> for many, as <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> doesn't run well on <strong>Steam Deck</strong>, which can't leverage <strong>NVIDIA DLSS</strong> as the Nintendo system can.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-2-Nintendo-Switch-2-first-screenshot.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>A PC-simulated look at Monster Hunter Wilds on Nintendo Switch 2, utilizing the leaked 'NSW2' graphics presets found in the Title Update 4 files</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In addition to the information above, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Monster Hunter Wilds </em>datamining group also discovered strings detailing the Switch 2 version's local multiplayer feature - <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Bring Nintendo Switch 2 consoles together to create or join a lobby using local wireless communication,"</strong></em> and "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Search for lobbies using local wireless communication. </strong></em><span><em><strong>Bring Nintendo Switch 2 consoles together to allow up to four players to participate,"</strong></em>&nbsp;- and mention of&nbsp;<strong>Tempered Gogmazios</strong>, whose </span><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/"><span>base variant </span>was added to the game with Title Update 4.</a></strong></p>



<p>This <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2 port of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>, which now essentially only requires an official confirmation with all this information discovered inside the game's files, is likely part of an effort to bring more players to the latest entry in the series, as CAPCOM thinks that <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/"><strong>the high price of the PlayStation 5 system impacted the game's sales in Japan.</strong></a></p>



<p>Hopefully, this effort will bear fruit and indeed bring both newcomers and <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>lapsed players back to the game</strong></a> as director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yuya Tokuda</strong> wished. Even with its issues, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a game that deserves to be experienced, as I wrote in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">review last year</strong>.</a></p>
