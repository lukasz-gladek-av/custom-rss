			<p>Resident Evil 9 began development as an open-world multiplayer game, and though the game was rebooted, the current version retains some of its original premise.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1925562211206103333#m">X</a>, well-known CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem commented on the latest rumors on the yet-to-be-revealed new entry in the survival horror series, revealing that the game started development back in 2017 and was originally meant to be the exact opposite of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, an open-world multiplayer game starring Leon Kenney and Jill Valentine set on a fictional island based off Singapore. The reason why CAPCOM was going with such a game was due to Resident Evil VII: Biohazard underperforming at the time, and the desire to make something that was the exact opposite of a game that was not meeting sales expectations. Resident Evil 9, however, didn't remain an open-world game for long. Development was rebooted around 2021 when Resident Evil Village came out, and most of its premise changed, although some elements remain the same, as well as Leon being the protagonist.</p>
<p>Besides revealing these interesting Resident Evil 9 tidbits, Dusk Golem provided a minor update on other series projects in the works. The Resident Evil Zero remake underwent some significant changes around half a year ago, and he believes what another leaker said regarding its reveal timing, which should be soon. In addition, Revelations 3, which was revealed a few years ago via a massive leak, was canceled in 2022.</p>
<p>Very little is known about Resident Evil 9 at the moment, other than the fact that it has been in development for a while. Despite the silence, however, the game is reportedly still set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-still-reportedly-planned-for-2025-reveal-and-2026-launch/">a 2025 reveal and a 2026 launch</a>. With plenty of showcases and events in the next few weeks, the wait may finally be over to see how the game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/">reinvent the series</a>, which is reportedly why it is taking so long to release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-9/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Diablo IV Season 9 will introduce plenty of new content, including new activities, powers, and the return of Astaroth as an endgame fight.</p>
<p>As revealed during yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZvEKK9UE_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campfire Chat</a> with members of the development team, Season 9, Sins of the Horadrim, will introduce a new endgame activity called Escalating Nightmares, a series of three Nightmare Dungeons where each dungeon's affixes stack with the next one. Awaiting the end of the third dungeon is an Exalted version of Astaroth that will surely provide an excellent challenge. To take part in the Escalating Nightmares activity, players will need to use Escalation Sigils, which can only be found inside Horadic caches found in Horadric Strongrooms, small dungeons found in Nightmare Dungeons. Another reward available for completing Horadric Strongrooms is Horadric Attunement, which can be exchanged for rewards. Every Horadric Strongroom allows players to choose between different challenges, providing a decent level of variety.</p>
<p>Diablo IV Season 9 will also feature the introduction of Horadric Spellcraft. This system allows users to create spells by combining three elements - Catalysts, Infusions, and Arcana. The first will determine the base, unmodified power, while the second and the third change the elemental property and enhance the base power of the spell. This system feels like a new variant of systems seen in previous seasons, so those who have been playing the game for a while and have engaged with its seasonal content shouldn't have too many problems getting to grips with it.</p>
<p>Beyond the new content coming with Season 9, the Diablo IV developers also outlined some of the changes coming to dungeons of both the Seasonal and Eternal Realms variety. In the new season, players can activate Nightmare Sigils from inside Nightmare Dungeons once complete, allowing them to go through a completed dungeon without having to exit it first. Nightmer Dungeons affixes are also getting expanded, and the new affixes will be available in both Seasonal and Eternal Realms Dungeons. All the new content and the changes outlined above will become available for testing next week on May 27th, when the 2.3.0 PTR patch goes live.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo IV</a> is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-dev-diary-provides-the-first-in-depth-look-at-its-features-and-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chrono-odyssey-dev-diary-provides-the-first-in-depth-look-at-its-features-and-content.1197282/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-dev-diary-provides-the-first-in-depth-look-at-its-features-and-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following this week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of a limited-time Closed Beta Test taking place in June via Steam, the Chrono Odyssey team has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lAc0wqXLvw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a 20-minute developer diary outlining the MMORPG's setting, features, and content in greater detail than ever before.</p>
<p>Executive Producer Sangtae talked about the world of Chrono Odyssey, which is not a standard fantasy setting. Instead, it was blended with cosmic horror inspirations from Prometheus and even from the constant danger to humanity posed by the Zerg in Starcraft. The game takes place in Setera, a world where past, present, and even other dimensions collide. Players will have to face formidable foes and entities even beyond reality itself, such as the Void, to protect Setera.&nbsp;While natural environments have been portrayed realistically, the world is littered with otherworldly entities that defy comprehension. The goal was to mix realism with the surreal.</p>
<p>Sangtae also admitted to having been influenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Trigger</a>, where the concept of time being used to prevent a cataclysmic event was first introduced in a videogame. Spacetime manipulation had never been implemented into an MMORPG, but the team pulled it off with the Chronotector system.</p>
<p>The developer diary then moved on to gameplay, where players won't be bound to a fixed main questline like in most MMORPGs. Part of that is due to the Chronotector, which enables them to trace remnants of the past or glimpses of the future and then manipulate time to reveal routes hidden in the present while also uncovering pieces of lore. In-game breadcrumbs have been kept to a minimum so that players may enjoy discovering Setera for themselves.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chrono Odyssey | Developer Interview #1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lAc0wqXLvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Unlike in most MMORPGs, players will be able to reach the game's max level (which wasn't specified yet) even just through exploration and crafting rather than solely through combat activities.</p>
<p>Chrono Odyssey won't force players into the usual so-called Trinity of roles (tank, DPS, healer/support), allowing them to progress however they like with varied play styles. The combat system will be far more active than in most games in the genre, thanks to the active parrying and dodging. The developers also took extra care that tanks and healers wouldn't suffer too much when playing solo, a problem MMORPG fans are well acquainted with.</p>
<p>Like in games such as Elder Scrolls Online, New World, or the recent Throne &amp; Liberty, this one will also allow players to swap between two weapons in real time. Swapping is, in fact, encouraged, since skill cooldowns for each weapon are separate. There won't be too many skills, anyway, as the development team focused on injecting them with multiple functions that will be activated depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Overall, the game is built for smaller scale rather than large scale gameplay.&nbsp;In the upcoming Closed Beta Test, players will experience single player content like Chrono Gates and Trials and party content like Expedition Dungeons and Region Bosses. Chrono Gates are one-on-one PvE fights against Void Apostles where reading the enemy patterns will be crucial; in Trials, on the other hand, players will travel through time and face puzzles, traps, and even randomized mechanics. Expedition Dungeons are for parties of three players, whereas in Region Bosses, multiple parties will have to join forces to defeat powerful bosses.</p>
<p>Chrono Odyssey also includes content that falls under the Exploration/Adventure category. Labyrinths are twisted rifts filled with puzzles, offering a break from combat, revealing secrets, and rewarding players at the end with a 'special treasure'. Time Portals, as you can guess from the name, are doors into the past where players gather materials and learn more about Setera's history. Lastly, Bounty Hunting brings back the focus on combat, as players are asked to track down and take down specific targets.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Sangtae said that the CBT won't showcase a perfectly polished version of the MMORPG. The objective is to gather feedback and keep improving the game. Over time, new regions and classes will be added to Chrono Odyssey, as well as new content tied directly to its core theme of spacetime manipulation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-gets-new-update-and-new-paid-creation-mod-from-renowned-modding-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-1-15-214-adds-very-low-display-settings-for-low-end-devices-and-improves-creation-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing phase on the Steam Beta ring</a>, Bethesda Game Studios has now released the Starfield May update to everyone. This is a relatively minor patch, although it does introduce Very Low graphic settings for expanded compatibility with lower end PC systems. It also expands the size limit of the official Creation mods to 2GB, while adding support for new icons.</p>
<p>Alongside the patch, a renowned modding team has also launched an interesting paid Creation mod called Watchtower. The mod was made by Kinggath Creations, which originally became famous with the acclaimed <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfields-outposts-meaningless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sim Settlements</a> series of mods for Fallout 4. Since joining the Bethesda Verified Creator Program, the team has released two fairly large mods for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (<a href="https://kinggathcreations.com/bards-college-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bards College Expansion</a> and <a href="https://kinggathcreations.com/east-empire-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Empire Expansion</a>) and two minor mods for Starfield (<a href="https://kinggathcreations.com/mcclarence-outfitters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McClarence Outfitters</a> and <a href="https://kinggathcreations.com/at-hells-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At Hell's Gate</a>).</p>
<p>Watchtower is much deeper, though. In this mod, which Kinggath says is seamlessly integrated with the base game and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered Space expansion</a>, players will experience a new storyline where they're chased by the titular new faction. They won't be alone, though, as they'll meet a fellow adventurer who has the same problem and will offer to help.</p>
<p>Throughout Watchtower, players will build a fleet and have them fight alongside you in space. The mod also adds powerful new ship attachments known as Skydrops, which allow your fleet to provide support drops or rain down attacks from orbit to assist you on your adventures on the ground. Dismantling Watchtowerâ€™s network will require destroying their listening posts and spy satellite arrays.</p>
<p>There's even a new player home, a formerly derelict star station that can be transformed into a hub for players, their crew, and other allied NPCs. Of course, there's also new equipment that can be looted from Watchtower troops, such as the new Cyberamps, which can augment the players' and crew's piloting skills. Watchtower is priced at $10; as a reminder, if you purchased the Premium Edition, you also received 1000 Creation Credits, which incidentally are the exact sum required to unlock the Creation mod.</p>
<p><iframe title="Watchtower: Orbital.Strike\Fleet.Command - Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_AUNVb3Jvyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In other news, a new rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> that Starfield will be announced and released for PlayStation 5 this year. It is unclear whether this will coincide with the debut of another major expansion. About a year ago, Bethesda's Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the plan was to release annual expansions for the sci-fi RPG, but that was before Shattered Space received a lukewarm welcome.</p>

			<p>During the Warhammer Skulls 2025 livestream, there were a lot of announcements for Warhammer 40K games. We already covered the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dark Heresy cRPG</a> from Owlcat Games and the remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-announced-launches-on-xbox-and-pc-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Marine: Master Crafted Edition</a>, but there's lots more.</p>
<p>For example, fans of the real-time strategy genre will be delighted to learn that Relic Entertainment will release Dawn of War: Definitive Edition later this year on PC via Steam and GOG.</p>
<p>This version includes all the Dawn of War and Standalone Expansion content (4 Classic Dawn of War Campaigns, 9 Armies, and over 200 Maps). The Warhammer 40K RTS classic will feature 4K support, upscaled textures (4x the originals), and image-based lighting for a higher level of fidelity. World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have all been improved, and new unit gloss and emissive lighting have been added. Relic also promised an improved gameplay camera and optimized HUD and screen layout for widescreen viewing. Lastly, the game has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community and will be compatible with existing community mods.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CLDiE8OQ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fatshark has also announced updates for Warhammer 40K Darktide. The first paid DLC, the Arbites Class, will launch on June 23 for $11.99; on the same day, the developer will release a free update to improve onboarding and the narrative experience while also reworking the difficulty progression system and making all missions available at every difficulty level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class Reveal | Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZ176VVTJZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The highly successful Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 also continues to be expanded by Saber Interactive. The endless co-op PvE Siege Mode will be released on June 26. Players will be able to obtain points with each defeated wave of enemies. They can then spend these points on ammunition, equipment charges, medical stims, and more, or use them to summon Astartes reinforcements such as AI Space Marines or the mighty Dreadnought.</p>

<p>Lastly, the turn-based tactical game Warhammer 40K Mechanicus II, due later this year on PC and consoles, was also shown with the debut gameplay trailer. The footage offers a first glimpse of a new planetary conflict between the Adeptus Mechanicus and the ancient Necron dynasty, in gripping tactical skirmishes across visually diverse and richly detailed battlefields, each teeming with opportunities for strategic domination.</p>
