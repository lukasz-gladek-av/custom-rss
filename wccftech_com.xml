			<p>Mecha BREAK developer Amazing Seasun Games recently invited Wccftech and a handful of other gaming outlets to their main offices in California to go hands-on with the latest PC build of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mecha BREAK</a>. In this session, we were able to sample a taste of the three core modes.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t kept up with the media blitz of reveal trailers and mode announcements, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-demo-first-time-in-actual-game-ai-powered-interactions-mecha-break/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mecha BREAK</a> is, at its core, a hero shooter with gigantic mechs. Players assume control of one of 13 mechs available across a variety of roles, including your typical short-range bruisers, long-range snipers, and healing/support mechs. Each mech comes with a radically different kit in terms of weapons and active/passive abilities that all run on their own timers that should feel instantly familiar to anyone that might have dabbled in Marvel Rivals or Overwatch over the past few years. What sets Mecha BREAK apart from the other hero shooters on the market is a fast-paced dash and evade gameplay that evokes strong feelings of taking your favorite Mobile Suit and giving them the mobility kit of Jehuty from Zone of the Enders. Sure, you could play Mecha Break as a slow and deliberate tank class if that’s more your style, or you could take the role of Vic Viper and play the Falcon and transform between mech and fighter plane at will.</p>
<p>The game's core mode focuses on the 6-vs-6 team gameplay across a variety of familiar match types, each with Amazing Seasun Games’ take on the formula. You have your standard team deathmatch modes and Headquarters-style capture and hold base defense as well as a transport mode that can only be described as pushing the payload. Depending on the mechs that you’ve unlocked/purchased, your mileage may vary depending on your performance in each mode. If Tricera is one of your first mechs unlocked, this walking fortress might be the perfect addition to guard the payload to its final destination.</p>
<p>My playstyle in most hero shooters leans towards playing more of the support/healing role, and I first tried Lumine and their twin pistol combat kit meant that I could either deal damage or swap to a healing mode to support my teammates, making this mech feel like a direct analog to Overwatch’s Moira. However, it wasn’t until I picked up the heavy sniper Aquila that I got a proper feel for how damage and harassment are meant to work in Mecha BREAK. Giving a sniper the ability to automatically lock on up to six enemies at a time and unload your entire sniper clip at once was too good to pass up, even if the damage inflicted was usually minimal, depending on how shielded the enemies were.</p>
<p>The different types of shielding and health are something I haven’t quite fully grasped in Mecha BREAK, despite how simple they are on the surface. Each mech comes with a passive shield called Fluid Armor that’s meant to sustain most types of damage; once it’s been drained or overloaded, then any damage taken is converted to direct HP damage. On top of that, each mech has its own variety of defensive stats to protect against energy, melee, ballistic and blast weapon types. For Aquila, all of that mech’s damage is done via energy weapons. I found out quite early on that, despite that massive sniper rifle Aquila carries, it doesn’t really do enough damage to be the AWP-wielder I wanted it to be. Instead, he’s more of a poke/harass type, meant to chip away at enemies from afar while the more melee or close-ranged focused attackers go in for the kill.</p>

<p>The real star of the show that Amazing Seasun Games invited us out to play was their new extraction mode, Mashmak. This loot-and-scoot PvPvE mode is all about airdropping onto a massive 16x16 km map, scouting for resources, taking out rival squads and NPC bosses, and making it out alive with whatever you can carry with you. Despite having a large map, the actual gameplay is limited to up to ten squads of three players, with empty spots filled by NPCs. To force players to keep moving and not camp out in one remote corner of the map, extraction points slowly start to appear at the ten-minute mark with more dropping every five minutes; once one has been used, it’s gone for good for the rest of that match. Not only do players have to contend with enemy players potentially camping these extraction points out, but there’s a constantly shrinking field of engagement as Corite Pulse Storms slowly engulf the battlefield. This field can disable weapon lock-ons and also inflict a constant drain on both mech health and fluid armor.</p>
<p>While players are limited to bringing one of their unlocked mechs to battle, that doesn’t mean it’s the only tool available to them. Players can call in a variety of airdrops, from rocket beacons to extract some of your earned loot, repair beacons to heal up the entire squad, and a survival beacon that each player comes automatically equipped with that can call a downed squad member back to the fight on a five-minute cooldown.</p>
<p>There’s another beacon that became my favorite part of Mashmak: the weapon airdrop. Players can select a completely different secondary weapon to bring to the fight and call at will. Playing a sniper that has some serious close-range deficiencies? Equip a lance and unleash your inner Panther. Unlike the main multiplayer modes where weapons are all recharge-based, both main and subweapons in Mashmak all run off of ammo that will need to be collected from enemy drops or loot crates.</p>
<p>In its current state, Mashmak’s NPCs are brain-dead if you can engage them from afar like Aquila. Because of this, I spent a good majority of my matches clearing out enemy fodder units from afar so that my teammates could rush in without fear of being shot by turrets. When it came time to face an actual player squad, Aquila felt underwhelming and my main source of damage came from a twin pair of rocket launchers that I picked up from one of those weapon airdrops. I could go either way with the current state of NPCs in Mecha BREAK’s Mashmak. It’s fun for a short while that Mashmak is largely a shooting gallery for enemies that don’t have much bite, but at the same time, there is rarely a sense of danger from rushing headfirst into a base due to the game's mobility and fluid armor mechanics, at least until you come across a rival squad or one of Mashmak’s gigantic bosses.</p>

<p>A successful extraction in Mashmak usually rewarded me with new research unlocks for different gear that I could bring into the next match or call in via airdrop, including high-mobility gliders that can give some of your slower attackers like Stego an unfair advantage when it comes to chasing down and harassing enemy squads.</p>
<p><a href="https://mechabreak.seasungames.com/">Mecha BREAK</a> is currently on track for a Spring 2025 release on PC (Steam and Xbox App) along with an exclusive console launch on Xbox Series S|X. PlayStation 5 has also been confirmed for a release later in 2025.</p>
