			<p>Alan Wake 2 Game Director Kyle Rowley was recently featured in an hour-long video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw0RByccsO4&amp;list=PLZeoUzft8lM_EjUOKaU4GvZDRGoWzfjgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on the Behind The Voice YouTube channel.</p>
<p>During the lengthy conversation, the industry veteran (Rowley started as a Q&amp;A tester on Black and White 2 twenty years ago, then worked as a designer on The Outsider, Homefront: The Revolution, and RuneScape before joining Remedy) revealed that he thought the Finnish studio should aim to be the European version of Naughty Dog.</p>
<p><em>When I came to Quantum Break, I was just excited about working on something that had... you know, one of my favorite games at the time was Uncharted, and I knew that we were going to do something that... I remember having a discussion with our lead animator at the time, and I was like, I think that we should be aiming to kind of be like the European version of Naughty Dog. Like, that would be cool if we could kind of get that same level of feel, and that was the type of game that I like to play, and so I was excited about working on it.</em></p>
<p>It's not at all a farfetched comparison. Both studios make action/adventure games with a highly cinematic flair. Of course, while both studios are highly acclaimed, Naughty Dog's games tend to sell a lot more - though to be fair, they also cost a lot more. For comparison, Naughty Dog's most recent game (The Last of Us Part II, which will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on PC</a> in its remastered version) cost $220 million, while Alan Wake 2 cost €70 million, according to Finnish analysts. However, Remedy is also used to make even cheaper games. Control famously only cost €30 million, and the initial budget for the upcoming sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was set at €50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog is stepping a bit into Remedy's comfort zone with its new sci-fi IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which was just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. On the other hand, Remedy appears to be following in Naughty Dog's footsteps when it comes to adapting its game IPs to live-action film/TV. Naughty Dog successfully did it (thanks to Sony, of course) with Uncharted and The Last of Us, while Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Annapurna</a> to adapt Alan Wake 2 and Control.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, a spiritual sequel to the best-selling game ever, Minecraft, was <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> by creator Markus 'Notch' Persson. As you might recall, Persson left Mojang after selling the studio he created to Microsoft for $2.5 billion in September 2014. The following year, he founded another game development studio called Rubberbrain, which, however, never released a game.</p>
<p>Persson relaunched it in 2024 under the new name Bitshift Entertainment. On January 1, the game designer <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> openly about Bitshift's current project (a traditional roguelike mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon crawler) but also polled his fans to see if they'd rather him make a Minecraft spiritual successor. Which they did (78% voted for this option). Two days later, Persson shared the mindset behind this announcement:</p>
<p><em>I basically announced Minecraft 2. </em><em>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</em></p>
<p><em>My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for. </em><em>I intend for the money to be spent for good, but my god have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, and I also very much value being a man of my word, so I also intend to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about. </em><em>And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me.</em></p>
<p>When a fellow X user asked him if he'd really make Minecraft 2, he replied:</p>
<p><em>No, I'd make a similar game based on what I think the audience that says they want that game might enjoy. Probably do early access to make sure we're on track. </em><em>But I mean I still sort of think I'm just a clown getting lucky in a sea of actual talents, so I have no idea if it actually will be good. But I'll try.</em></p>
<p>Based on his track record, it would be no exaggeration to call him a one-trick pony, as Minecraft is his only real claim to fame in the game industry. Even if he does end up releasing such a game, it would inevitably be compared to his previous creation, which Mojang continuously updates for the legions of fans who still play it regularly.</p>
<p>The last content patch, The Garden Awakens, dropped in early December and added a new biome and a new mob. There are also plenty of spin-off games for those looking for different experiences, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/minecraft-dungeons-the-shallowest-depths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Dungeons</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-legends-will-release-on-consoles-and-pc-on-april-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Legends</a>. And A Minecraft Movie airs in theaters on April 4, 2025.</p>
