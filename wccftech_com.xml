			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on/">Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades</a> bring a slew of improvements that vastly enhance the experience, but the latter's upgrade also misses an important opportunity.</p>



<p>In a new in-depth analysis by Digital Foundry of the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for the two open-world entries in the series, it's confirmed that Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still uses AMD FSR 1 in the upgraded version. AMD's upscaler is mentioned in the game's Intellectual Properties page, and a deep look at the game's image quality confirms that it is still being used, leaving a lot of distracting flicker in view during gameplay. This is most definitely a missed opportunity, considering the Nintendo Switch 2 supports the superior NVIDIA DLSS upscaling solution that has already delivered impressive results in several launch titles.</p>



<p>Despite the above and a few other issues, such as issues with shadows not being completely fixed on Nintendo Switch 2, and a draw distance that's mostly identical to that of the original system, both Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are very solid upgrades. The higher dynamic resolution range in both docked and handheld mode returns a sharper image, which improves gameplay by making it easier to spot items on the ground from a distance, for example, and the new higher-quality environmental textures make both games more pleasing as a whole. The rock solid 60 FPS in both games, the faster load times and the implementation of the Zelda Notes round up two upgrades that are among the best we have seen to date.</p>

<p>Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are hardly the only games to have received significant improvements on Nintendo Switch 2. Splatoon 3, for example, sees an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">enormous resolution boost</a> on the system, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/">unpatched games</a> running at unlocked framerates often hit 60 FPS with no trouble.</p>

			<p>The original Silent Hill remake announced last month may release sooner than most anticipated, as it reportedly has been in the works for a few years already.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, known leaker Dusk Golem revealed that the remake of the classic survival horror game in development by Bloober Team has been in the works for three years already, before the remake of the second entry in the series developed by the studio even launched. Considering the current pipeline of games geared towards yearly releases of Silent Hill games, the leaker speculates the remake could be released in 2027, following Silent Hill F, which launches this September, and the mysterious Townfall in 2026.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the Silent Hill remake was announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">last month</a> with a brief teaser trailer that sadly did not show the game. However, the music used in the trailer left no doubt that the project was indeed a remake of the first entry in the series, which was later officially confirmed by Konami itself. Nothing else is known about the game, but by looking at how the Silent Hill 2 remake turned out, there's no doubt that the game in in very good hands, as the Polish team developed a faithful reimagining of the original, and its best game to date, as highlighted by Chris in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/"> review.</a></p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>The Silent Hill remake is currently in development. Platforms and release date have yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>This morning, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announ</a>ced in a press release that it has entered a strategic partnership with fellow Japanese entertainment conglomerate Bandai Namco. Sony agreed to acquire 16 million Bandai Namco shares for roughly 68 billion yen (around $465 million), gaining control of 2.5% of the company's total shares.</p>



<p>Nobuhiko Momoi, Executive Vice President at Bandai Namco Holdings Inc., said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>The Bandai Namco Group promotes an "IP axis strategy" that aims to maximize IP value by leveraging the appeal and worldview of IP, providing the optimal products and services at the optimal timing in the optimal regions. We are filled with excitement about the potential to create new entertainment by combining Sony Group's strengths and technological capabilities across various entertainment fields with Bandai Namco's IP axis strategy. Through this collaboration, we aim to connect with IP fans worldwide, co-create the future together, and realize our Purpose, "Fun for All into the Future," and Mid- to Long-term Vision, "Connect with Fans."</em></p>



<p>Toshimoto Mitomo, Chief Strategy Officer and Representative Corporate Executive Officer at Sony Group Corporation, added:</p>



<p><em>Through this partnership, we aim to co-create an array of content and experiences that exceed expectations and deliver Kando （emotion） to even more fans, alongside Bandai Namco Group, with its outstanding capacity for multidirectional expansion of diverse IP and deep connections with fans at real touchpoints, both domestically and internationally. By combining the strengths of both companies in the field of entertainment and unlocking the potential of compelling IP, we will further accelerate our efforts to maximize IP value and realize Sony's long-term vision, "Creative Entertainment Vision".</em></p>



<p>The press release mainly emphasizes that Sony will produce and distribute anime and 'other video content' based on Bandai Namco's intellectual properties. That said, the collaboration could extend to other areas like games and music. Even so, it is highly unlikely that Bandai Namco's games will become exclusive to PlayStation consoles, especially given the minuscule share percentage.</p>



<p>In late 2024, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became</a> the largest shareholder of Kadokawa Corporation (the parent company of FromSoftware) with 10% shares. However, a few months ago Tencent also <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased its own shares</a> up to nearly 8%, almost as much as Sony.</p>
