			<p>Fans of the stealth series Styx will have to wait a little longer for the titular goblin to return. After it was initially set to arrive sometime in 2025, developer Cyanide Studio and publisher Nacon have confirmed that the game has been delayed, and will no longer make its 2025 release window. The silver lining in all of this is that while we know it won't be out this year, we do have a release date for next year, as Styx: Blades of Greed is set to arrive on February 19, 2026.</p>



<p>A release date trailer accompanied a post on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3290690/view/529864539779367425?l=english">game's Steam page announcing the delay</a>, which also includes a snide comment from Styx, where he says, "<em>What? I'm not late, I just like making you wait."</em></p>



<p>The post on the game's Steam page includes a similar tone, with Cyanide Studio - speaking in character as Styx -  writing, "<em>Yeah, yeah, I know, waiting isn’t your favorite thing. Mine either. </em><em>(Unless I’m waiting in the dark to stab someone, of course)</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The devs are taking a few extra months to polish everything up, tweak the bits that need tweaking, and make sure my grand return is as glorious </em><em>(and chaotic)</em> as it deserves to be. <em>A much more sharper adventure. One worthy of slipping back into my slightly grimy, perfectly stylish boots.</em>"</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo got the chance to preview</a> Styx: Blades of Greed during Gamescom 2025. Though its hardcore approach to stealth might not be for everyone, it still presents as an interesting game that will likely please fans of the originals. "<em>Though a little complex at times, the Styx: Blades of Greed Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the third entry in the series will elevate the franchise to new heights. With the abilities and tools on show being so diverse and versatile, I'm really interested to see what else the game will offer when it launches this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how fans of the original games and newcomers to the series take to it when it arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on February 19, 2026.</p>
