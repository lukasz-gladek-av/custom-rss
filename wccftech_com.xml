			<p>The official reveal trailer has dropped for The Directorate: Novitiate, revealing a new narrative-driven single-player game that will be a third-person action RPG, with the game taking place in Los Angeles. This title is being developed and published by Nesting Games.</p>
<p>The year is 2006, and the world is magic-infused. In this game, you'll be playing as Mercury, where you will get to use a mixture of guns and magic to fight off supernatural threats and chase down a serial killer across Los Angeles. To see what you can expect from The Directorate: Novitiate, make sure to check out the official reveal trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Directorate: Novitiate – Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XH0XEYavkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883830/The_Directorate_Novitiate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for this game has been released, revealing the base features you need to know about the game. If you liked<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-trademarks-fbc-firebreak/"> Control</a> or Alan Wake, then this may be a game you want to keep an eye on. It has very similar themes and styles of combat, from what is seen in the GIFs on Steam.</p>
<p>Kana Luna (Mercury) finds her life turned upside down as she becomes involved with the Costa Muerta, a Dark Syndicate of the Directorate. Because of this, she now needs to hone her skills, where you'll help her rise up from the rank of Novitiate.</p>
<p>It will be much more than just guns and magic, as there will be a high-stakes story to go along with it. While you will get to experience the traditional third-person shooter mechanics, there will also be magic spells that you can utilize, as well as the ability to upgrade your skills and perform finishing moves that add flare and style to the scene.</p>
<p>As with any high-stakes story, there will also be important player decisions to be made, where your choices will impact the story later down the line. You have to make the decision on whether you want to remain loyal to the Edicts of the Directorate or choose to stay in the real world. However, this will all have consequences for friends, foes, and more.</p>
<p>At the moment, the game doesn't have a planned release date, with more details to come in the future and a release period to be confirmed at a later date.</p>
<p>Will you be playing The Directorate: Novitiate when it releases?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-adds-smooth-motion-a-driver-based-frame-generation-ai-model-for-rtx-50-gpus/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-572-16-driver-available-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-dlss-4-support/">NVIDIA app and GeForce Game Ready driver update</a> had a lot of big stuff, like the release of DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation for 75 games and apps, the new Override functionality, and more. However, NVIDIA has also sneaked in a brand new feature they hadn't previously disclosed: Smooth Motion. Essentially, this is driver-based frame generation that owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can toggle globally or per game.</p>
<p>Here's what NVIDIA said about it:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.</em></p>
<p><em>To enable Smooth Motion, select a compatible DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 game in Graphics &gt; Program settings of NVIDIA app. Scroll down the list of options on the right to reach “Driver Settings”, and switch Smooth Motion on.</em></p>
<p><em>Smooth Motion can be applied to games running at native resolution, with super resolution technologies, or other scaling techniques, typically doubling the perceived frame rate.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This sounds like the NVIDIA equivalent of <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fluid-motion-frames-2-ai-optimization-performance-enhancements-low-latency-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Fluid Motion Frames 2</a>, although, in this case, it's a full-fledged AI model, which is not surprising given the company's focus on artificial intelligence. Sure, there are already ways to inject frame generation in games that do not support it natively, like Lossless Scaling. However, we're definitely eager to check out Smooth Motion and see how well it handles frame generation across several older games. Stay tuned for our impressions.</p>
<p>Today's Game Ready driver is also optimized for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which launches in a few days with DLSS Super Resolution support, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which is out today on PC with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and Ray Tracing for ambient occlusion, shadows, and reflections. DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be added in a future update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - Announce Trailer | PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOJaeD0Si04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By the way, there are improvements to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-video-super-resolution-out-now-testing-shows-significantly-sharper-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> as well, thanks to a more efficient AI model that NVIDIA says uses up to 30% fewer GPU resources at its highest quality setting. RTX Video Super Resolution now also upscales HDR videos, so when viewing HDR videos below your display's resolution in the browser, they will be automatically upscaled to your native display resolution.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also added a GPU Utilisation feature for RTX video when Quality is set to Auto. Setting GPU Utilization to High will use as much GPU power as necessary to provide the best quality super resolution available on the installed graphics card.</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard developers and writers have been laid off, while BioWare continues working on the next entry in the Mass Effect series under the leadership of veterans from the original trilogy.</p>
<p>In a blog post shared <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">yesterday</a>, BioWare provided an update on the studio, saying that, now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been released, a core team is working under the leadership of veterans including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, Parrish Ley, on the next Mass Effect game. At the current stage of development, BioWare doesn't need the support from the full studio, and has <em>"worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this restructuring, in reality, meant layoffs. According to posts on LinkedIn and Bluesky, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1idp2wt/various_developers_and_writers_have_been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks subreddit</a>, writers and developers who worked on Dragon Age: The Veilguard at BioWare no longer work at the studio. These include Lead Writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trick Weekes</a>, Lead Editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karin West-Weekes</a>, Narrative Editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a>, Producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Cheverie Cott</a>, Associate Game Producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7290469609919389696-Nh1q/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Steed</a>, Senior Product Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lina-a-14642294_ill-write-up-a-proper-open-to-work-post-activity-7290515415674327040-ZOC6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lina Anderson</a>, and Senior Systems Designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelle Flamm</a>. Insider Gaming's Mike Straw also confirmed that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1idp2wt/comment/ma0v0qx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few dozen developers</a> were also laid off. Since Dragon Age: The Veilguard only reached 1.5 million players, missing expectations by nearly 50%, it's not too surprising that BioWare is being impacted by the game's underperformance. However, it's still disingenuous to hide these layoffs behind restructuring claims.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">review.</a></p>
