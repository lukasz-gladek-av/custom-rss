			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 port of Tekken 8 is not off the table, but it is also far from certain at this point. The news comes directly from Game Director Katsuhiro Harada, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to Eurogamer</a> during the recent Evo event:</p>



<p><em>It's an interesting option, and not totally off the table. But it would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware. From a business standpoint, the Switch 2 is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience. But the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision. At this point in time, there are noâ€¦ (laughs) There is nothing to announce.</em></p>



<p>It is honestly a surprising statement from Harada. After all, this is not a complex open world, but a fighting game powered by Unreal Engine 5, which fully supports the latest Nintendo console. Far more taxing titles, like Cyberpunk 2077 for example, have been successfully ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. Perhaps the real reason is that Bandai Namco does not see enough of an audience on the console to justify the port expenses, although fellow Japanese CAPCOM begs to differ, having released Street Fighter 6 on the Switch 2 when it launched on June 5. The port has been well received so far, too.</p>



<p>Anyway, Tekken 8 continues to be supported. At Evo 2025, Bandai Namco announced that a new DLC character, Armor King, will be released on October 13 for Season 2 Character Pass owners and on October 16 for all users. Additionally, a new fighter named Miary Zo from Madagascar will be released as DLC this winter, along with a new stage called Baobab Horizon.</p>
