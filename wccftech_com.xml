			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525346350588494399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new big patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, updating the game to version 1.5. This update introduces major fixes to the A-Life system, which was kinda broken when STALKER 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in November 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view. Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.</em></li>
<li><em>The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.</em></li>
<li><em>Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world’s immersion.</em></li>
<li><em>Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants' lair, for example, those mutants won't simply reappear moments later.</em></li>
<li><em>A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualization. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone's population.</em></li>
<li><em>Visualization range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualization range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the "pop-in" effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualization.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more bug fixes, tweaks, and technical improvements to performance and Ultra-wide screens, for instance, but arguably the other highlight of STALKER 2 Patch 1.5 is the public release of the modding tool. Called Zone Kit, it is available for download <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-zone-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the Epic Games Store</a> and will allow users to create new animations, weapons, mechanics, and more. The mods can then be shared via Steam Workshop or <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mod.io</a>. The former page isn't up yet, but Mod.io already has 43 mods listed.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Wccftech that they would add cross-platform mods, multiplayer, and hardware ray tracing post-launch. The first one has been released, and now we're expecting them to focus on delivering the remaining promises made to fans.</p>

			<p>A new version of the Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition RealityV mod is now available for download, introducing some very welcome improvements as well as some features that are already available in the Legacy version of the mod.</p>
<p>The 3.1 version introduces the 8K Milky Way night time sky and stars from the Legacy version of the game, improved FSR for a cleaner image and better edge detection, improved TAA which should show less ghosting, improved weather variety with a reduction in the frequency of rain, improved dusk sky colors for clear and extra sunny weather, improved exposure color shift and color correction which should improve how ray tracing looks and more. The new version of the mod, as well as some screenshots showcasing the improvements outlined above, can be found on the mod's creator, BadassBaboon's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/realityv-for-gta-132248613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon page.</a></p>
<p>Following its launch earlier this year, Rockstar Games has continued working on Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, releasing a few patches that introduce some welcome improvements. The latest patch was launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-patch-new-ray-tracing-settings/">last week</a>, introducing two new ray tracing options on PC that enable ray-traced reflections and a second ray bounce for ray-traced global illumination.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. It features the same improvements seen in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game, as well as additional ray tracing features. A Legacy version of the game continues to be available on Steam, allowing users with older systems to play the game without the new ray tracing features.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, Atomic Heart developer Mundfish unveiled several games, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sequel to AH</a>, an online multiplayer spin-off (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cube</a>), and a survival horror game they will publish (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ill-is-an-intriguing-survival-horror-published-by-atomic-heart-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ILL</a>).</p>
<p>As you might recall, we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-final-q-fsr-2-confirmed-old-consoles-will-be-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Mundfish often ahead of the launch of Atomic Heart. Now that the studio's new phase has begun, we reached out once again to the Founder, CEO, and Game Director, Robert Bagratuni, to learn more about all these projects. We're starting today with Atomic Heart 2, arguably the most anticipated one, given that it's the sequel to a highly successful title that <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-has-reached-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> over 10 million players.</p>
<p>The good news is that it's clear the scope and the ambition are much higher. The bad news is that we won't get to play it for a rather long while, although that's not too surprising given that the first installment only launched two years ago. Anyway, keep scrolling below to read the full Q&amp;A.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Everything in the trailer was captured in-engine using Unreal Engine 5, and it features a mix of gameplay footage and in-game cinematics. As we’re not diving deep into detailed gameplay breakdowns yet, what’s shown is only a small glimpse, but it’s enough to hint at some of the key directions we’re taking.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Hello, Robert. Can you tell us when Atomic Heart 2 takes place exactly in the timeline? Can you share which ending of the original will be followed canonically?</strong></p>
<p>Atomic Heart 2 takes place a few years after the conclusion of the first game, picking up the thread following the fallout and DLCs, but in a fresh chapter of the story. The sequel follows the aftermath of the original’s multiple endings, including the upcoming fourth DLC, which will bring more clarity to that matter. We are staying true to the beautiful dystopian world of science and technology, but expanding into broader retro‑futuristic environments across the globe, with a world shaped by previous upheavals and consequences of the first game’s events.</p>
<p><strong>Some users have noticed a more Western vibe from the trailer. Will that be reflected in the actual game? If so, can you expand on this?</strong></p>
<p>We’re definitely not abandoning the art direction and atmosphere that players loved in the first game. The retro-futuristic, dystopian world of Atomic Heart is still very much intact, and music remains a powerful part of how we express it.</p>
<p>Choosing Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now for the announcement trailer wasn’t about changing direction, but about expanding the emotional range of the universe. Actually, that very track was released at the end of ‘70s in USSR on vinyl, as “КВИН – Не останавливай меня”. It’s exactly the kind of cultural crossover that fits into the Radio of the Future we’ve built, familiar yet reimagined through the lens of our world. And just like in the first game, there will be many tracks, many moods, and a mix of regional classics and global icons. If you remember how “Komarovo” and “Trava u doma” became iconic moments in Atomic Heart, rest assured, that spirit is alive and well in the sequel.</p>
<p><strong>How much of the trailer was gameplay and how much of it was cinematics?</strong></p>
<p>Everything in the trailer was captured in-engine using Unreal Engine 5, and it features a mix of gameplay footage and in-game cinematics. As we’re not diving deep into detailed gameplay breakdowns yet, what’s shown is only a small glimpse, but it’s enough to hint at some of the key directions we’re taking.</p>
<p>We’re focused on evolving the combat system with more variety, especially through the use of the glove’s abilities, intense encounters with enemies, and, of course, boss fights. You can see a bit more gameplay in the extended showcase we recently published on our official YouTube channel. As for the cinematics, we wanted to introduce some of the new characters players will meet, not all of whom will be clearly good or evil, and to show that the world itself is becoming more layered and diverse.</p>
<p><strong>Will Atomic Heart 2 include any multiplayer elements, or will those be reserved for The CUBE?</strong></p>
<p>While Atomic Heart 2 focuses on a personal journey, The CUBE opens the door to a much broader, shared experience within the same retro-futuristic dystopia. The CUBE is a narrative spin-off, but not a side project. It’s a massive MMO RPG shooter that takes place after the events of Atomic Heart 1. It expands the universe both narratively and structurally. The Cube itself, as a literal, mysterious megastructure, is a key part of the lore. It's a fully integrated piece of the timeline, not just a multiplayer layer. Players will explore this shifting world, uncover its secrets, and interact with systems and consequences born directly out of the Atomic Heart games.</p>
<p><strong>Is P-3 coming back? Will there be any other playable characters in AH2?</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve watched the trailer closely, you may have spotted P-3 and some other familiar faces - so, yes, some key characters from the first part will return in Atomic Heart 2. That includes characters who survived the events of the original game and its DLCs. As for P-3 specifically… let’s just say his story isn’t over. But we’re not ready to reveal exactly how or in what capacity just yet. We’re not discussing playable characters in detail right now, but the story absolutely will continue threads that fans of the first game will recognize, while also opening new doors and perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>The game world of this sequel seems much larger, as evidenced by the presence of vehicles and new traversal options. Can it be considered an open world? Will it feature dynamic day/time, weather, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>Great question! This is something we’ve thought about a lot, especially after seeing players’ desire to explore the world in the first Atomic Heart. For example, we had this incredible flying city of Chelomey, which players were able to explore only once (not considering another opportunity in the DLC#3). We're paying close attention to all the feedback, so we know that the open world experience in AH1 wasn't perfect. And with Atomic Heart 2, we want to improve this significantly.</p>
<p>The game is much more open in structure. We’re building larger, interconnected spaces that offer more freedom in how you explore, revisit, and engage with different systems - vehicles, traversal tools, and new verticality are all part of that. There’s a core narrative path, but also a lot of space for discovery and replayability. We’re not ready to reveal all the environmental systems yet, but expect more dynamic elements like time of day and weather to play a role in shaping both mood and gameplay. That said, everything is still grounded in story and world logic - the scale is there to serve immersion, not overwhelm it.</p>

<p><strong>You mentioned that AH2 will introduce an 'expanded RPG system' featuring a 'living world' and 'various activities'. Can you provide more information on all these aspects?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we’re introducing a more expanded RPG layer in Atomic Heart 2, but we’re doing it the Mundfish way - integrated into the world and the experience, not layered on top just for complexity’s sake. The “living world” means that we want the world to feel less like a backdrop and more like a responsive, evolving system. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves - we will share more information when we are ready.</p>
<p>As for the RPG elements - we are aiming for deeper weapon customization, skill trees, and progression paths that allow players to shape their playstyle much more than before.<br>
When we talk about “various activities,” we mean things that reward curiosity: things to do between the main missions. But always in service of the core experience - we’re not turning it into a checklist-style open-world game. Everything still has that handcrafted, surreal tone fans expect.</p>
<p><strong>Will players make several choices leading to profound consequences for the various missions and the narrative? Are there companions in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Without giving too much away, we can say that Atomic Heart 2 will offer players more agency than before. Choices do matter, and your actions can influence how certain events or missions unfold. As for companions… that’s a tricky one to answer without spoilers. Let’s just say: you won’t be entirely alone.</p>

<p><strong>You also briefly mentioned improvements to the combat system. What can we expect on that front?</strong></p>
<p>Combat was one of the aspects that players really connected with in Atomic Heart - the weight, the variety, the creative freedom in how you approached each fight. That positive feedback meant a lot to us, and it set a high bar for the sequel. With Atomic Heart 2, we want to go even further. To make sure we do it right, we’re starting internal playtesting much earlier this time around. Whether it’s moment-to-moment gunplay, skills usage, or how enemies react, our goal is to make every fight feel better, deeper, and more satisfying than before.</p>
<p><strong>What's the current state of the game? Prototype, Pre-Alpha? How long will it be until we can see more?</strong></p>
<p>The game is in active development and well past the prototype stage. We're a few years out from release, and taking the time to ensure everything feels tighter, polished, and more immersive. More updates will come as we hit key milestones.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-could-cause-many-consoles-to-die-in-a-couple-of-years-as-more-users-are-reporting-problems-over-time.1227786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The previously reported PlayStation 5 liquid metal issues are becoming increasingly widespread, and many units, especially launch units, that are out of warranty, could die in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Speaking on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Law Is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassells highlighted how the system's<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/"> critical flaw</a> is causing the liquid metal used for cooling to drip down the bottom of the console when placed vertically, causing dry spots on the APU that compromise its functionality and forces a shutdown under certain conditions, is getting more widespread. A while back, the developer received reports that the latest update of their game, the dinosaur-themed MMO Path of Titans, was causing PlayStation 5 consoles to power off suddenly. Initially, the developer provided the usual basic troubleshooting advice, like cleaning the console, but the issue persisted. After pinning the related discussion thread on the developer's Discord server, more people showed up reporting the problem, and after Alderon Games pinned a more general message asking players to report if their PlayStation 5 systems were suddenly shutting down while playing any game, a lot more users showed up with their reports. Some members of the team also experienced similar issues and are now investigating what could be the cause. Everything seems to point to the liquid metal issue, which is more likely to manifest with the console placed vertically.</p>
<p>After talking with Sony about this issue, Alderon Games discovered that the more intensive the game gets, the higher the chances are of a PlayStation 5 shutting down due to the liquid metal issues. With the latest update to Path of Titans, the percentage of players affected by the issue rose to 2%, 3%, which may not sound like a lot, but it's still a lot of units. However, better pinpointing what is causing affected systems to shut down is difficult, according to the Alderon Games founder, as it seems to depend on the combination of where the dry spot is and what component of the APU is stressed the most. As there's no way to track CPU and GPU temperature via software, troubleshooting is extremely difficult, and any fix on the developer's part, such as limiting framerate to avoid putting any of the system's components under stress, could end up impacting those with fully working systems for no reason.</p>
<p>Thankfully, not all PlayStation 5 systems are affected the same way by this design flaw. Sony attempted to fix it in the slim revision and the PS5 Pro by adding ridges to the APU and heatsink to prevent the liquid metal from dripping to the bottom of the console, but it's too early to say if this actually fixed the issue. Older models are more at risk, and with most of them now being out of warranty, repairing them could be a costly endeavor. Talking with Sony about the issue, Matthew Cassells suggested setting up a free repair program for systems affected by the issue, but this may not be feasible, considering how many systems are affected. The situation may not be as bad as with the many Xbox 360 consoles that failed with the infamous RRoD, but it is still bad enough that the Alderon Games founder believes that a lot of systems will die in the next couple of years.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Flaw Could Affect Millions, AMD Zen 6 Nears 7GHz, Switch 2 | Alderon Games | Broken Silicon 315" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KjR1uk9LI9c?start=600&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Having used my launch PlayStation 5 not a whole lot, I can't say I have experienced the liquid metal issues that many are experiencing, but if more and more users are indeed affected by them, Sony will eventually have to address them in some manner. Hopefully, the company will indeed follow Alderon Games' founder's advice and set up a free repair program that would definitely make a lot of customers happy.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-how-to-turn-weapons-lethal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-%E2%80%93-how-to-turn-weapons-lethal.1227747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like in the first entry in the series, there's a very good reason why killing people in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is not a very smart idea. Following the cataclysmic event known as the Death Stranding, the spirits of the dead have started roaming the world of the living, manifesting themselves as Beached Things, or BTs for short. Every time one of these beings manages to consume a human, a massive explosion that annihilates everything in its vicinity, called a voidout, occurs.</p>
<p>As such, the game makes it abundantly clear right from the onset how going for non-lethal options when dealing with human enemies like MULEs is the way to go to be able to defend oneself without having to deal with the terrible consequences of a voidout. However, if you really want to, there's a way to unlock some lethal weapon options as soon as Sam's new adventure begins in Mexico.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DEATH-STRANDING-2_-ON-THE-BEACH_20250625114400-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Every weapon in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach with an MP designation can be turned into a lethal weapon from the weapon wheel menu</strong>. Hold the right direction button to bring up the menu, select an MP weapon on the main weapons tab, and<strong> press and hold the right and left triggers as well as the O button</strong>. As soon as you do, you will see a little animation play out in the circle surrounding the weapon, and once the animation has played out, the weapon will have turned lethal and can be used to kill human enemies. This little trick is revealed in-game for the first time after delivering to the pizza chief a few hours in, but you don't have to wait to complete this delivery, as the option of turning most weapons lethal is active right from the start of the game. Do note, however, that not every weapon can be used to kill enemies, as weapons that are specified to use rubber bullets or tranquillizer rounds cannot be rendered lethal, no matter what.</p>
