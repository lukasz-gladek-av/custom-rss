			<p>Ubisoft has nine Assassin's Creed games currently in development, according to a new report published by Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>We have been aware of at least four for a while.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-jade-mobile-gameplay-leaked-on-reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jade</a>, the mobile game set in Ancient China, is one of only two officially announced</span>. There hasn't been any news on this title for at least two years, but Henderson says it'll be the next franchise entry to make its debut.</p>
<p>Then there's Invictus, the Fall Guys-style multiplayer spin-off. Last month, the same insider <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-invictus-an-arcade-multiplayer-game-rumored-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> this game would launch in 2025. Today, he added that Ubisoft is prepared to support it for at least five years post-launch, provided it sells according to internal estimates.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a> (codenamed Obsidian) should launch around the same time, so we could be playing it in late 2025 or early 2026 at the latest.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Hexe is the other game on this list that Ubisoft has confirmed. As you might recall, a brief tease was <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> during a Ubisoft Forward presentation in September 2022. This project is in development at Ubisoft Montréal and is led by Clint Hocking, a Ubisoft veteran who was the Creative Director of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Far Cry 2, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/watch-dogs-legion-bold-gameplay-mild-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>. It was officially described as a 'very different' franchise experience, and it does sound like it will be the next Mirage-like game. The current plan, says Henderson, is to launch it when Assassin's Creed Shadows ends its post-release support. This should happen in around two years, so Hexe could drop in 2027, with one year of planned post-launch support of its own.</p>
<p>The next big open-world Assassin's Creed RPG, codenamed Scarlet, has already entered production. Henderson speculates it might be Assassin's Creed Nebula, a game that should take place in three different settings: the Aztec Empire, India, and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The roadmap gets increasingly hazy from now on. Stardust is the codename of another remake, but there's no info on which game would be remade. Then there's Emerald, reportedly another multiplayer game with a five-year support plan. Emerald is expected to be released close to Stardust.</p>
<p>'RPG 3' is completely unknown at this point, except that it should launch after the usual two years of live support for Scarlet. Similarly, the report could not add anything about 'Remake 3' other than the fact that it will release around one year after RPG 3.</p>
<p>That will be many years from now. Meanwhile, Ubisoft has officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shares-year-one-roadmap-and-theres-no-mention-of-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the year one roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-reportedly-canceled-a-single-player-game-this-year-but-another-unannounced-game-is-still-in-the-works/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to insider Daniel Ritchman (as reported <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/naughty-dog-125394539?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on his paywalled Patreon page</a>), Santa Monica-based developer Naughty Dog quietly canceled an unannounced single-player game earlier this year. The project had been in development for over a year following the cancellation of The Last of Us Online, the ambitious multiplayer game that was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> because Naughty Dog did not want to turn into a live-service games studio (after Bungie explained to them what it would mean).</p>
<p>As you might remember, towards the latter end of its development, The Last of Us Online was being directed by Vinit Agarwal, who previously worked as Game Designer on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part II. He then moved on to this unannounced project, which was still in its infancy when it was canceled. Agarwal subsequently left Naughty Dog.</p>
<p>Again, according to Richtman, another unannounced single-player title is in the works at the studio. This one is further along in development, having started around three years ago. Its director is Shaun Escayg, who returned to Naughty Dog in April 2021 after a brief stint at Crystal Dynamics as the Director of the ill-fated Marvel's Avengers. Escayg was previously credited as the Lead Cinematic Animator on The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, and later directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.</p>
<p>There's no further information on this game, but we might learn something more concrete in the next couple of years, at least based on the usual development timeframe of a triple-A game. Of course, the main project at Naughty Dog remains Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a brand new sci-fi intellectual property <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. This action/adventure game is directed by Neil Druckmann, the company's president and the renowned creator of The Last of Us (and current executive producer on the HBO show). Druckmann recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it'll be a game where players will feel lonely, unlike most Naughty Dog titles, where the protagonist is accompanied by friends and teammates. Religion will be a central theme.</p>
<p>The game has no release date yet, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> it won't launch before 2027. It will launch on PlayStation 5 and, presumably, on PC after a while.</p>

			<p><strong>Update #2 03/05/2025:&nbsp;</strong>The video from Comic-Con Italy is out <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2448211166?t=18941s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a>, and it looks like the interpreter added the information for some reason, whereas Yuji Horii said nothing of the sort. Don't get too excited - it's probably just a misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Update 02/05/2025:</strong> According to <a href="https://it.ign.com/chrono-trigger/217954/news/square-enix-potrebbe-essere-al-lavoro-su-un-remake-di-chrono-trigger-si-attende-lufficialita">IGN Italy</a>, Yuji Horii's words about a Chrono Trigger Remake were, "<em>I understand there is also a remake in development</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Quest series creator and Chrono Trigger writer Yuji Horii seems to have accidentally confirmed that a Chrono Trigger Remake is on the way at a panel during Napoli Comicon.</p>
<p>Spotted by<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chrono-trigger-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-yuji-horii/"> Insider-Gaming</a>, users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> who were at the panel heard Horii, through a translator, confirm the existence of a Chrono Trigger Remake. He only realized his mistake after the panel host asked to confirm what he had just said. When his translator put the follow-up question to Horii, he covered his mouth in shock.</p>
<p>The next thing his translator reportedly said was, "<em>You have heard nothing</em>." Earlier this year, on March 11, 2025, Square Enix celebrated the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger</a>, though the celebrations were not limited to a single day. At the time, Square confirmed that the celebrations would include "<em>various projects</em>," and now it seems we know what at least one of those projects is.</p>
<p>Now that Horii's comments are beginning to spread, it'll be interesting to see if Square Enix is quick to respond with an official confirmation, or if they'll stick to the marketing plan they have, and wait to announce the remake when they had originally planned.</p>
<p>The surprise of the remake might be gone, but the excitement fans have for it certainly isn't. Chrono Trigger is regarded as one of the best and most influential games in video game history, and is one of the few games of its time that has yet to get a proper remake. If anything, it's reassuring to know that Square Enix was well aware of the fact that Chrono Trigger is deserving of the same treatment that Dragon Quest III got, if that is the kind of remake they're making, of course.</p>
