			<p>During The Game Awards 2024, Chinese publisher Netmarble aired a trailer for Game of Thrones: Kingsroad. If you were watching the show on a tiny screen at FullHD resolution or lower, it might have looked like everything Game of Thrones fans have ever wanted from a game based on Martin's beloved saga: an action-adventure RPG where we could stand side by side with the most important characters, who bore properly made likenesses and voiced by the real actors behind the award-winning HBO show.</p>
<p>However, if, like me, you were watching the show at 4K resolution and on a large TV, you likely immediately noticed that the visual quality was nowhere near those of other games that premiered in the show, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD Projekt RED's The Witcher IV</a>. In fact, it looked a couple of generations behind, especially when it comes to things like hair and clothes.</p>
<p>There's a simple explanation for that: Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is, sadly, a game for Android and iOS devices. Sure, mobile games have gotten a lot closer than they used to be, but when it comes to the triple-A segment, there's still a massive difference with PC and console games. Sure, a PC version might be released at some point, but it wouldn't be the same thing as developing natively for PC and consoles first.</p>
<p>Anyway, the game will put you in the role of a new character who unexpectedly becomes the heir to House Tyre, a small noble house from the North. The character is customizable both visually and in terms of classes, of which there are three: Sellsword, Knight, and Assassin.</p>
<p>Netmarble (which previously made a Game of Thrones <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-mmorpg-for-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMORPG</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-beyond-the-wall-rpg-is-now-available-for-iphone-and-ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn-based RPG</a>, both for mobile) shared the following statement from CEO Young-sig Kwon:</p>
<p><em>We believe Game of Thrones is a world rich with untold stories and adventures, and we’re pleased to bring Westeros to life in an exciting new way for gamers.</em></p>

<p>Netmarble aims to release Game of Thrones: Kingsroad at some point next year in Europe, America, the Middle East, Africa, and Oceania, while the timing for Asia hasn't been finalized yet.
