			<p>After around a year and a half of near-complete silence, Honor of Kings: World has resurfaced at the Game Developers Conference 2025 with a gorgeous new trailer that shows off the game's vibrant biomes and several boss fights, including some featuring a group of players.</p>
<p>Honor of Kings: World takes place in the setting of the extremely popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. In 2024, Honor of Kings was the top-grossing mobile game with $2.6 billion. Of course, this is a much different game. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-is-an-action-rpg-announced-by-tencent-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in October 2021 as an open world action RPG developed by TiMi Studio Group, developer of Call of Duty: Mobile, Pok√©mon UNITE, Age of Empires Mobile, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force</a>. It also features a collaboration with acclaimed Chinese writer Liu Cixin, known for The Three-Body Problem. Apparently, he will adapt a story called The Poetry Cloud. In May 2023, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-to-support-dlss-3-ray-tracing-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Honor of Kings: World would support NVIDIA DLSS 3 and ray tracing on PC. It is likely that before its release, it will be updated to the new DLSS 4.</p>

<p>Honor of Kings: World is playable for the first time at the Game Developers Conference 2025, and our envoy Kai Tatsumoto has an appointment to check it out, so stay tuned for our first impressions of the game. For now, it has been announced to be coming for PC and mobile; you can find the newly launched official website <a href="https://honorofkingsworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
