			<p>Now that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">is out and in players' hands</a>, besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/">another Metal Gear Solid game being remade</a>, what players are looking for next from Konami, is Vol. 2 of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection.</p>



<p>Which is why it wasn't a surprise that during the Metal Gear Production Hotline at Tokyo Game Show 2025, the topic of where Vol. 2 is and when we'll get to see it came up. Translated by <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">X (formerly Twitter) user Kuwabara357</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/">VGC</a>), series producer Noriaki Okamura stepped up to be the one to try and satisfy players curiosity, but could unfortunately only add that Konami is still working on it.</p>



<p>"<em>It has certainly taken quite a while now,</em>" Okamura began. "<em>Since we called the first installment 'Vol.1,' it's only natural to expect a second one, and that's what we said years ago.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But, as we've repeated several times, we are making it. We've been working on it properly while also producing Metal Gear Solid Delta. At the right timing, we'd like to share with you all not only about its progress but also the direction going forward. I'm sorry, it feels like I always have to say this, but please wait just a little longer. How long 'a little longer' actually means, well, it's hard to say.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But the project is moving forward properly, and we believe it's shaping up to be something enjoyable really. So please, wait just a bit more, more information is coming</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Vol. 1 of the Master Collection <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-release-october/">launched almost two years ago at the time of this writing</a>, and though, as Okamura points out, Konami has previously confirmed that a Vol. 2 is in the works, we've heard next to nothing about it, and which games will be included in the collection.</p>



<p>We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">seen rumours pointing to</a> Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain being the three games in the collection, but nothing concrete. If those are indeed the three titles going to be included, then it's not difficult for fans of the series to understand why Konami is taking its time with Vol. 2. </p>



<p>It's no small task to untangle MGS4 from the PlayStation 3's CELL architecture, which it was initially made on, and then improve it in all the ways players would expect from a game that's 17 years old now running on modern console and PC hardware. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-latest-updates-bring-major-performance-improvements-for-metal-gear-solid-4-red-dead-redemption-and-persona-5/">RPCS3 figured out how to get MGS4 running on a PC years ago</a>. If they can do it, surely Konami can. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-development-difficulties/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-ix-remake-development-may-be-going-through-some-difficulties-new-insider-information-suggests.1309695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake revealed via <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/">a massive NVIDIA GeForce Now leak a few years ago</a> is the only leaked Square Enix game that has yet to be officially announced, and if the information shared online by an insider with a solid track record is any indication, its official announcement will probably still take some time.</p>



<p>A few days ago, Reddit user TomAto314, whose claims of having access to insider information are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lkhd4k/comment/nepsfts/?context=3">backed by their reveals</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-website-remake/">Timeless Tale record released in time for the Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary celebrations</a> ahead of official announcements, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lkhd4k/comment/nepsfts/?context=3">claimed</a> that the game has been in their company's database for three years, they have never received a build for testing, and all updates on it only mention a delay until 2024, which doesn't sound very promising.</p>



<p>While the user has a solid track record to date, we have to take the information they have provided with a huge grain of salt. Nonetheless, it does <span>align with what other known insiders, such as Nate Drake, previously said&nbsp;regarding the project's status, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-trouble-canceled/">development troubles and even cancellation</a>, so there's a high chance it&nbsp;</span>is still a long way from release, if development is still proceeding.</p>



<p>Although the status of the rumored Final Fantasy IX remake is uncertain, PC players can enjoy the ninth entry in the series with vastly improved visuals and new features thanks to the Moguri Mod. The 9.0 version of the mod, released last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-moguri-mod-9-0-download/">introduces improved field backgrounds, reworked battle backgrounds, and more</a> for a vastly improved experience.</p>
