			<p>The remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is just a few months away from launching, according to a new rumor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>As part of Ubisoft's quarterly and half-year financial results (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered here</a>), which were just released, the publisher confirmed an unannounced game in its lineup of titles due to be released before the end of the fiscal quarter (March 2026). According to Insider Gaming, this is indeed the remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, the 2013 game that first introduced sea-based combat and exploration to the franchise, which later inspired the ill-fated standalone game Skull &amp; Bones.</p>



<p>The first rumors about this project <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started emerging in June 2023</a>. About a year later, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Assassin's Creed fans could look forward to some remakes, but did not specify which of the games would get this kind of treatment. In June 2025, though, it was actor Matt Ryan (who voiced the protagonist, Edward Kenway) who <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let slip</a> that fans might soon get to play as Edward all over again. Later, Ryan kind of regretted being this open because Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened him with a lawsuit</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, in September, French website Jeux Video Magazine <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> some actual details about the remake. According to their sources, the Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag remake will cut the modern-day sequences, which were among the weakest in the original, to replace them with more content featuring Edward Kenway. Moreover, it will be updated to incorporate the RPG mechanics that have been introduced with Assassin's Creed Origins and have since been featured in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and the most recent installment, Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reports that the game will launch 'the week of March 23', which falls just before the end of Ubisoft's fiscal year. If the launch is really this close, an official announcement at The Game Awards, due to air on December 11, 2025, appears to be inbound. There, we might also see new gameplay of the Prince of Persia remake, which is also scheduled to launch before the end of March 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, game publisher Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed its financial results</a>, which prompted strong rumors that Tencent would acquire the company. The quarterly and half-year FY 2026 results <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52w2Cas6xfQjegpCgP1SZC/b38c338a1bf6f365849a50d2f182d061/Ubisoft_FY26_H1_Earnings_PR_EN_vF.pdf?_gl=1*a069ru*_gcl_au*NzM3OTg5NDkzLjE3NjMxMDczNjM.*_ga*MTMwOTI1MjU0NS4xNzYzMTA3MzYz*_ga_C4N5020N2R*czE3NjM3MTc4NzQkbzIkZzAkdDE3NjM3MTc4NzQkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are now available</a>, and while Ubisoft did strike a deal with Tencent, it is not for a complete acquisition of the company. The Chinese corporation has instead provided a significant cash infusion to become a minority stakeholder of Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Yves Guillemot said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>The closing of our strategic transaction with Tencent – which will see Tencent become a minority shareholder in our new subsidiary, Vantage Studios – is now imminent, as all conditions precedent have been satisfied. This marks a pivotal milestone in Ubisoft’s transformation, significantly strengthening our financial position by bringing in €1.16 billion of cash, enabling the Group to deleverage, as planned. It will also empower Vantage Studios to accelerate the growth of our three flagship IPs under a dedicated leadership team.</em></p>



<p>Vantage Studios was formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> on October 1. It's a new subsidiary focused entirely on the growth of Ubisoft's three biggest franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry. According to Guillemot, the 'design' of Vantage Studios is expected to be finalized by the end of 2025. The full details of the new operative model will be outlined in January 2026.</p>



<p>Overall, it was a solid quarter and half-year for the publisher, which reported net bookings of €491 million this quarter (+39% year-over-year) and €772 million for the semester (+20% year-over-year), exceeding guidance. Ubisoft attributes these results to 'stronger-than-expected partnerships', including a meaningful contribution from live TV and animated series. Speaking of the latter, Ubisoft noted that Netflix's Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Deathwatch debuted last month to critical acclaim, and its success also strengthens the position of the upcoming Splinter Cell remake.</p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports that Assassin's Creed Shadows wasn't selling that great</a>, Ubisoft said the franchise as a whole overperformed in its Q2, largely thanks to Shadows, which saw a player boost from the Claws of Awaji expansion and the New Game+ update. Overall, in the year-to-date, Assassin's Creed has generated 211 million session days, roughly 35% higher than the average of the last two years.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six did not fare as well, and Ubisoft claims this is due to a temporary surge in cheating that impacted activity and player spending versus expectations. The publisher said the team now has additional resources and further hires planned to deal with cheating through a 'robust plan'.</p>



<p>Finally, The Division 2 continued to benefit from the momentum of the Battle for Brooklyn DLC release in May, as well as the regular content updates released by Massive. This combination has helped attract new players to the game. Alongside rising player numbers, engagement has increased, with a record Q2 in terms of 'Session Days' since FY2020-21. The game's performance this semester has already exceeded last year's annual net bookings. </p>



<p>On Massive's front, Ubisoft said Star Wars Outlaws was well received on the Nintendo Switch 2, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora posted a 'strong performance' this quarter in anticipation of the announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-expansion-december-release-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">From the Ashes expansion</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-person update</a> that will be released soon, just ahead of the new movie, Fire and Ash. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Genshin Impact developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-developer-mihoyo-will-go-for-realistic-graphics-for-its-unreal-engine-5-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">miHoYo</a> has just unveiled its next open world game, Varsapura, with a 31-minute gameplay video.</p>



<p>The developers haven't shared much in the way of official details, but the footage provides more than a glimpse at what players will find in this upcoming title. The setting is a surreal, near-future city plagued by Mind Rot, a sort of parapsychological force that erodes reality, spawns monsters, and threatens both minds and the world at large.</p>



<p>It's all quite mysterious and subtly unsettling, a blend of bureaucracy (chiefly the SEAL, Shadow Emergency Alliance), psychic hazards, and mind-bending realities that reminded us of Remedy's Control. At the beginning of the demo, the player starts as an applicant to SEAL and undergoes mind-verification, interviews, and psychological evaluation as they attempt to join an organization dedicated to containing or reversing mind rot events. Later, they become an operational SEAL officer, and that's where we first see the combat of Varsapura. It looks like a fairly standard action combat system, featuring fast-paced action where the protagonist uses an umbrella to damage foes both in melee and from afar.</p>



<p>Some missions seemingly involve environmental hazards and puzzles, such as avoiding mind rot contamination, reacting to unstable environments, and using unique character abilities. Moreover, unlike in Control and more like miHoYo's games, the player will be able to count on the help of NPC squadmates.</p>



<p>At some point in the demo, we see that players will be able to drive vehicles to navigate the open-world environment. Varsapura also appears to offer RPG-style dialogue options to choose from, and some of them even seem to use specific character attributes or skills, like Empathy, Persuasion, or Deception, to accomplish their goal. Of course, the extent of the dialogue's consequences remains unclear at this point. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Varsapura, which is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, is still clearly a long way from launch. In fact, miHoYo is recruiting more people across its <a href="https://jobs.mihoyo.com/#/position?jobName=Varsapura" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shanghai</a>, <a href="https://www.hoyoverse.com/en-us/careers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singapore, and Los Angeles</a> offices to work on the project.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-now-available-xbox-series-50-percent-launch-discount/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-is-now-available-on-xbox-series-s-x-at-50-launch-discount.1360426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB's rating of Silent Hill 2 on Xbox</a>, KONAMI has announced today that the remake of the classic survival horror game is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/SILENT-HILL-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now available on Xbox Series S and X and on the Xbox PC Store</a>. The game actually supports Xbox Play Anywhere, so you'll get it on both platforms with a single purchase.</p>



<p>The Japanese publisher has also attached a promotion to the launch: the game's Standard and Deluxe Edition are currently 50% off on the new platform, and the same applies on PlayStation 5. The Steam version doesn't have any discount for the time being, but KONAMI might just be waiting for the platform's Black Friday sale to trigger it.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 Standard Edition is thus priced at $34.99 on the Xbox ecosystem, while the Deluxe Edition costs $39.99. There is also a dual pack with Silent Hill f, which launched a couple of months ago. The Standard Edition of this dual pack is priced at $79.99, while the Deluxe Edition will set you back $95.99. Silent Hill f is also separately discounted by 20% as part of KONAMI's Black Friday sale.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake was released in October 2024 to widespread acclaim. Bloober Team's work <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a 9 out of 10 here on Wccftech</a> by reviewer Chris Wray:</p>



<p><em>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</em></p>



<p>To date, the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has sold more than 2.5 million units</a>, making it likely this Xbox release will push it toward 3 million copies sold in the near future. Following this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful release of Silent Hill f</a>, the franchise's next installment is the spin-off Townfall, which a retailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently listed for a March 2026 debut</a>.</p>
