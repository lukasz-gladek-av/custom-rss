			<p>Here's something we weren't expecting: Age of Empires II Definitive Edition might be about to launch on PlayStation consoles. The rumor comes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1gibltj/aoe2_joins_ps_confirmed_or_graphics_bug/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the franchise's subreddit</a>, where someone spotted players supposedly joining a multiplayer match from Sony's platform, possibly while testing the port. Truth to be told, The Verge's Tom Warren did hint it could happen in a newsletter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted </a>a few months ago:</p>
<p><em>As part of Project Latitude, Microsoft has also been considering launching Age of Empires II Definitive Edition on rival consoles in early 2025, and its upcoming remastered spinoff, Age of Mythology: Retold, could come, too.</em></p>
<p>Age of Mythology: Retold <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> two months ago, earning an 8/10 score from Wccftech's Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Age of Mythology Retold brings back a classic with new - great - visuals, a new UI, and a few new gameplay features. While it does, for the most part, feel more like a remaster, there's still an incredible amount to love here, and the few new features the army of developers have added bring a whole new level to the game.</em></p>
<p>Age of Empires II Definitive Edition is much older, though, having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> nearly five years ago. Granted, developer Forgotten Empires has continuously provided great support for it, releasing six expansion packs (Lords of the West, Dawn of the Dukes, Dynasties of India, Return of Rome, The Mountain Royals, Victors and Vanquished) while a seventh called Chronicles: Battle for Greece will launch on November 14.</p>
<p>It's also the remaster of the most acclaimed game in what is arguably Microsoft's longest-standing franchise (except for Flight Simulator). In that regard, it would be peculiar to see it on the rival platform, though Microsoft has long <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted</a> its strategy when it comes to exclusive games. In fact, more Xbox and PC exclusives are expected to launch on PlayStation 5 in the near future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter.1027638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Nintendo reported its latest quarterly financial results to investors. The previous trend of weak Switch sales has continued: the hybrid handheld/home console sold only 2.62 million units this quarter, for a lifetime total of 146.04 million units as of September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The quarterly Switch sales decreased by 10.58% year-over-year. A similar result was seen regarding quarterly software sales (39.6 million units), which dropped by 10.66% compared to last year's quarter. Out of the new games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> has sold 2.58 million units, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake</a> sold 1.94 million, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> reached 1.57 million.</p>
<p>In this underwhelming quarter, Nintendo's operating profit went down by 29.07% year-over-year. Moreover, the company cut its forecast for the full fiscal year from 13.5 million Switch units to 12.5 million units:</p>
<p><em>Although Nintendo Switch hardware and software unit sales through the first half of the fiscal year were both below our initial expectations, many people continue to play with Nintendo Switch even in its eighth year since launch. For hardware, by continuing to convey the appeal of the Switch, we try to not only put one system in every home, but several in every home, or even one for every person.</em></p>
<p><em>Another objective is to continually release new offerings so more consumers keep playing Switch even longer and we can maximize hardware sales. For software, in addition to Super Mario Party Jamboree, released in October, we have other titles planned for release, such as Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership (November) and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (January 2025). Other software publishers plan to release a wide variety of titles, and we will</em><br>
strive to invigorate the platform by continually introducing new titles in addition to the existing titles.</p>
<p><em>We have modified the Nintendo Switch hardware and software sales unit forecasts for the fiscal year in consideration of the sales trend through the six months ended September 30, 2024.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, analysts weren't exactly thrilled with the Japanese corporation's performance. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-05/nintendo-sees-bigger-profit-decline-on-faltering-switch-demand?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Bloomberg</a>, Toyo Securities's Hideki Yasuda said:</p>
<p><em>The Switch is at the end of its shelf life, and even software sales are weak. If this trend continues, the Switch’s momentum will drop even further.</em></p>
<p>Serkan Toto of Kantan Games added:</p>
<p><em>Nintendo overestimated the appeal of their 2024 software pipeline, which has no real blockbusters but several filler games. Looking at the software still coming out this fiscal year, I believe the adjusted hardware and software sales forecast is still too high.</em></p>
<p>None of this is surprising, as the whole industry and market are waiting for the announcement of the Switch 2. However, Nintendo seems content not to hurry.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission.1027611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much of the Slitterhead gameplay revolves around Rarities, gifted humans who can achieve higher attunement with the mysterious Night Owl and maintain their consciousness while being possessed, which allows them to use some unique fighting styles and skills that can make your life easier against all sorts of opponents.</p>
<p>Unlock new Rarities is also a necessity to proceed in the main campaign, as you will need the help of specific characters to continue Night Owl's war against Slitterheads. The first time this happens is right after starting to investigate a religious cult that seems to be bringing together monsters and humans, and you will need Edo's help to proceed in this investigation.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241031011038_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you are notified of needing a new Rarity to proceed through the story, play the Parasite Mission 2nd round mission again. At the start of the mission, proceed normally until you reach the main street. Walk around until you hear two NPCs talking about a stray dog and a homeless man. Continue past these two characters, and you will find the stray dog, who is the same one you have met at the very start of the game. Possess it, follow the scent like you did at the beginning of the game, and you will eventually reach the homeless man named Edo. Possess the character, defeat the Slitterhead, and he will join Night Owl in his quest. Quit the mission, and the Hidden Cave RE 2nd Loop mission will be unlocked.</p>
<p>Besides being required to proceed through the story, Edo is an extremely strong Rarity to use if you enjoy fighting Slitterheads head-on, as he is a close-range fighter that can dish quite a bit of damage, deflect attacks automatically, perform a quick dodging maneuver, and increase attack power with his skills. He may not be a looker, but he sure knows how to deal with enemies!</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-qa-with-keiichiro-toyama-discussing-gameplay-mechanics-old-gen-release-and-silent-hill-series-revival/">Slitterhead</a>, Hyoki and his Rarities will have to fight a variety of enemies of the supernatural kind, but there will be times when regular old humans will get in their way, leaving them no choice but to use their special powers to take them out and continue their hunt for the vicious Slitterheads. These humans, however, are very different from the Civilians that Hyoki can possess and will fight back with everything they got.</p>
<p>During the Oppressive Force mission, you will encounter members of the S.P.E.U., a military unit out to destroy not only Slitterheads but also Hyoki. Dealing with them is considerably different than dealing with the monstrosities you have fought before, and you will have to adapt to the situation and use completely different strategies.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031121432_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For starters, always make sure to take advantage of any cover you can find.&nbsp; If you're unsure where they are, just press the LB button to slow time and survey your immediate vicinities, possibly possessing any Civilian or Rarity placed near covers. The members of the S.P.E.U. tend to attack relentlessly, so if you're caught outside of cover, you will receive a lot of damage.</p>
<p>As for taking these enemies out, you can employ a variety of different strategies, which depend on the Rarities you have brought to the mission and the Passive Skills you have learned. A very effective strategy involves two of Alex's unique skills: Blood Well and Time Bomb. The first is used to draw together every character in a certain radius in a single point. At this point, possess one of the attracted Civilians, use the Time Bomb skill, and possess another character far from the one that activated the skill to watch them explode and damage everyone in their vicinity. If you bring Anita, you will have no lack of Civilians to blow up, thanks to her Devil's Scent skill. The War Cry skill also works quite well with this strategy, as this Civilian Skill attracts the attention of any nearby enemy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031122458_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you want to make dealing with humans armed to the teeth in Slitterhead even easier, you should have one of your Rarities learn the Possession Rush passive skill. This skill, which is always active as long as a Rarity who has learned it is present, allows any possessed character, whether it's a Rarity or a Civilian, to unleash a powerful attack after being possessed by Hyoki as long as the enemy is in front of the camera. By hopping from one character to the next, you can easily deal with multiple enemies easily as long as you handle the camera properly. This is an excellent strategy to deal with S.P.E.U. members armed with shields. Possess an NPC located behind their backs, unleash the Possession Rush skill, and watch them fall dead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios announced that the first Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer stream will air tomorrow at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET <a href="http://twitch.tv/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a> from Kuttenberg, one of the two main cities featured in the game. During the stream, the developers will hold a special live Q&amp;A session, during which they will reveal more information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the studio has announced a four-part live-action video series starring Tom McKay and Luke Dale, who play Henry of Skalitz (the main character) and his noble friend Hans Capon. The debut episode set in Kutná Hora will go live on Thursday, November 7, at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET on the developer's <a href="http://youtube.com/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is now set to launch on February 11, 2025. When the game was first unveiled earlier this year, the goal was to release it before the end of 2024. However, a short delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. That's where we had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> Warhorse Executive Producer Martin Klima, who was all too happy to dive into the game's features for our readers.</p>
<p>By the way, Warhorse also announced today a major milestone for the first installment. It was only this February that Kingdom Come Deliverance <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-passes-6-million-sales-on-its-6th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> six million units sold on its sixth anniversary; nine months later, it has surpassed 8 million units. It's likely due to major discounts ahead of the sequel, but it's still an impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the developers published a blog post <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/4514388158400430393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> where Senior Game Designer Ondřej Bittner talked about the inner workings of survival in the game.</p>
<p><em>The game has survival elements to it because you have to eat and you have to sleep. But that’s for the immersion. It's not hard to be rested and well fed and so on. The food spoils over time, so if you’re going somewhere far away it’s good to have dried fruit or dried meat jerky because it lasts longer. You can be vulnerable when you’re asleep. You can be robbed, or you can be attacked, depending on the circumstances. We even have it in the executioner’s historical records that someone might rob a house, get drunk, and then pass out on the bed - the perfect crime…</em></p>
<p><em>But generally, if you’re found somewhere you’re not supposed to be, you’ll be woken up. Or if someone’s looking for you because you did something wrong and they find you asleep, they’ll wake you up. You’ll need to pay your fine, or you’ll be arrested, whipped, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>Overall, the design philosophy is said to differ from the average game. Rather than asking players to focus on tasks, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will encourage players to pay attention to their surroundings.</p>
