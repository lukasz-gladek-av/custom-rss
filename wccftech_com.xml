			<p>Three years ago, in May 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-brand-starting-in-2023/">learned we were officially coming to the end of an era</a>: EA's annual football games would no longer be titled 'FIFA' followed by the corresponding year. After the FIFA organization <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-series-name-change-ea-billion-dollar-licensing-fee/">reportedly requested a $1 billion licensing fee</a> from EA, the long-held partnership ended, with EA moving on to call its annualized football series 'EA Sports FC,' creating new licensing deals with the professional football teams and leagues featured in the game. FIFA, for its part, declared it would develop its own football game, and we've just seen what that looks like. A <a href="https://www.playfifaheroes.com/">mascot-forward mobile and console game</a> called FIFA Heroes.</p>



<p>'Mascot-forward' means that instead of the game featuring professional footballers, it features the mascots for international teams, including Maple the Moose for Canada, Zayu the Jaguar for Mexico, and Clutch the Eagle for the United States of America. It's a five-a-side game that doesn't seem to take the same simulation-forward approach as EA Sports FC, but instead is depicted as something closer to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Sloclap's Rematch</a> or other arcade-focused football games.</p>

<p>A press release for FIFA Heroes describes players being able to<em> </em>build their "<em>dream squad with beloved football personalities, recognizable fictional characters and FIFA’s official mascots through the years</em>." It'll feature both PvE and PvP matches, and is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile, sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>At FIFA, uniting people through the love of football has always been our priority</em>," said Christian Volk, director of gaming and esports at FIFA. "<em>With FIFA Heroes, fans can create a multiverse team: mixing their treasured fictional heroes, favourite players, and our own mascots. We're offering the love of football to a new generation, while rekindling the nostalgia and fun for families and older players who’ve grown up with FIFA. FIFA Heroes fits seamlessly into our digital football portfolio under the FIFAe umbrella, adding another strong pillar to our fast-growing gaming ecosystem</em>."</p>



<p>The game is being developed in a partnership between FIFA, Solace, and Enver Studios, with Solace's director, Kyle Joyce, adding, "<em>From day one, Solace has worked closely with ENVER, the development studio, to create pioneering game development experiences that bring players together</em>. <em>With FIFA Heroes, we set out to capture what actually makes football so compelling: speed, drama, and rivalry. Football has a unique way of bringing people together, and this game is our way of putting that love of the sport into play.</em>"</p>



<p>With the FIFA World Cup returning in 2026, it's possible that FIFA Heroes could lean on the tournament to create a solid level of popularity. Though any hype or popularity gained will only be maintained if the game is actually good and fun to play. We'll see how FIFA's first major game release separate from EA goes when it arrives sometime next year.</p>

			<p>House of Golf VR is a new mixed-reality VR game from Starlight Games, a studio founded by Wipeout co-creator Nick Burcombe, set to arrive on October 30, 2025, on Meta Quest 2, 3, and 3S headsets.</p>



<p>The gameplay trailer unveiled by Starlight Games today shows that if you have enough space to put on your headset and swing your arms as if you're holding a putter, you can create your own digital mini-golf course.</p>



<p>You can create courses inside your house wherever you have the space, and you can even take it outside to make it feel even more like you're taking a mini-golf course wherever you go.</p>

<p>"<em>House of Golf VR is all about playful innovation</em>," said Gary Nichols, chief executive officer of Starlight Games, in a press release. "<em>We've created something truly special; a game that gives players the tools to bring their imagination to life, whether that means turning their living room into a golf course or escaping into our beautiful VR world</em>."</p>



<p>House of Golf VR is the debut title from Starlight Games, though it's not the only project the team has on the go. It's also working on what it describes as a "<em>futuristic sports game</em>" still in development, and a "<em>sci-fi rouge-lite action game</em>," according <a href="https://starlightgames.co.uk/games">to its website</a>.</p>



<p>In other Meta Quest news, an Xbox-branded edition of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-officially-revealed-following-leak-available-now/">Meta Quest 3S was unveiled and launched earlier this year</a>, and we now know that a sequel to last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-confirmed-meta-camouflaj/">VR hit Batman: Arkham Shadow is currently in development</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-zero-parades-studio-zaum-workers-alliance-union-uk-branch-iwgb/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-and-zero-parades-developers-za-um-form-workers-alliance-union-at-uk-branch.1314796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, the same team of developers now working on an espionage RPG in a similar vein to Disco Elysium, titled Zero Parades: For Dead Spies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/zero-upgrades-preview-za-um-crpg-disco-elysium/">which Wccftech recently previewed</a>), have formed a union at ZA/UM's UK branch called the Workers Alliance, represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).</p>



<p>The news was announced with a blog post on the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/blog/">IWGB Game Workers website</a> and in an interview with ZA/UM developers on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. According to the IWGB, the Workers Alliance at ZA/UM UK is "<em>the UK's first recognized games industry union</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>I think the workers at ZA/UM all agree that we have something unique at the studio that we want to preserve for years to come</em>," Poppy Ingham, marketing manager at ZA/UM in the UK, told GI.Biz. UI/UX designer Declan Keane added "<em>The more I've worked here, the more I've realized that what we have is a unique makeup of people, and the union is a large effort to solidify that</em>. <em>Instead of thinking about what the next year will look like, we'll be working together, taking what we've learned already and doubling down on that. I want to play the games that this team makes</em>."</p>



<p>Following the release of Disco Elysium in 2019, a string of controversies followed ZA/UM, with the core creatives on Disco very publicly leaving the studio and claiming to have been ousted by ZA/UM's executive branch, with game director and writer on Disco, Robert Kurvitz, writing an open letter to players claiming the studio had been stolen from him and the rest of the studio's creatives in 2022. </p>



<p>Kurvitz also accused the studio's chief executive officer, Ilmar Kompus, of fraud. Kompus fired back with accusations against Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov that they created a toxic working environment at ZA/UM. Lawsuits were filed shortly after and are still ongoing to this day.</p>



<p>What followed in the wake were two extended documentaries from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames">People Make Games</a> that attempted to break down what happened at ZA/UM, three project cancellations, including a sequel to Disco being cancelled and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">expansion for the original game that resulted in layoffs last year</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-officially-in-development-at-longdue/">founding of multiple studios</a> each started by various members of the key creative team behind the original Disco.</p>



<p>Now, the remaining workers at ZA/UM, many of whom did work on the original Disco, but none of whom were the original key writers on the project, are hoping to ensure that ZA/UM remains a good place to work. While many former developers have had less-than-positive things to say about the studio and its conditions, Ingham and other members of the studio's union look to this formation as a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>"<em>The hope for the future</em> of <em>ZA/UM is just to continue what we're doing, but in a very secure and comfortable position now that we have a union established, and to really challenge the studio and the studio's management in the best way possible, to make sure that we're putting ZA/UM out there as the best place to work in the industry - we take care of our staff, we have a union to push the things we require, and we can preserve the talent that we have here</em>."</p>
