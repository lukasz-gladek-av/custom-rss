			<p>According to a new analysis shared online today, the comprehensive implementation of ray-traced global illumination in the recently released Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is likely a preview of the Grand Theft Auto VI features.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> released earlier today their analysis of the new version of the fifth entry in the series by Rockstar Games released on PC this month, providing a good look at the new features and how they compare with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game. The feature that sets the new PC version of the game apart from every other is the comprehensive implementation of ray-traced global illumination, which, by itself, suggests that this tech is being developed for Grand Theft Auto VI and has been backported to its predecessor. Usually, when a developer implements platform-exclusive ray tracing features, it does so in a limited fashion, as highlighted by games like Dying Light 2, where RTGI works only for the sun, or in The Witcher 3, where RTGI does not work on a per-pixel basis but only applies to the world with probes, causing visual artifacts.</p>
<p>In Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, on the other hand, RTGI not only works on a per-pixel basis, but it also features stable and coherent bounce lighting from any random light, which is not easy to implement and requires a lot of work. The same tech, in addition to emitting materials, is featured prominently in the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer, further suggesting that the Enhanced Edition new features are a preview of the tech that will be featured in the next entry in the series launching later this year.</p>
<p>If the same Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition RTGI tech will be featured in the next entry in the series, Digital Foundry believes how the Enhanced Edition runs could be indicative of the performance that should be expected on base consoles for the sequel. While the tech is cleverly optimized and is not particularly heavy on the GPU, it is heavy on the CPU, and a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, a CPU comparable to that of the base current generation consoles, cannot run the game at a steady 60 FPS at 1440p resolution and NVIDIA DLSS at Quality mode. This, in addition to the reveal trailer running at 30 FPS, further suggests that Grand Theft Auto VI will be limited to 30 FPS on base consoles, as many believe it will.</p>

<p>Ray-traced global illumination is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">new features</a> introduced in Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition.

			<p>Shortly after their slew of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 announcements</a>, NVIDIA also shared brief new clips for a trio of highly anticipated upcoming action games: Lost Soul Aside, Stellar Blade, and Tides of Annihilation. All of them are made by Asian developers, and they will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to guarantee exceedingly high frame rates, up to over 500 FPS in Lost Soul Aside.</p>
<p>The latter game has been in development for a long time. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-amazing-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered it</a> nearly seven years ago, when it was being developed for the PlayStation 4 Pro. Unlike other long-delayed games, though, there's a very good reason - it all started as a one-man project of Yang Bing before it gained a lot of attention and support. At long last, Lost Soul Aside will launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on May 30</a> for PC and PlayStation 5, making it the first single player game published by Sony Interactive Entertainment to release day and date on the two platforms. The action title, which still runs on Unreal Engine 4, also supports ray tracing; you can find detailed system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Soul Aside | Launching with DLSS 4 and Ray Tracing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7qedRQM-bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Strictly in order of release, the next game is Stellar Blade from Korean developer Shift Up. This one (also published by Sony Interactive Entertainment like Lost Soul Aside) launched a year ago on the PlayStation 5 to excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviews</a>, though developer and publisher have both since been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> for trademark infringement.</p>
<p>As seen in the brief footage, Stellar Blade, which is also powered by Unreal Engine 4, runs at up to 371 frames per second with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.&nbsp;The PC release is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> at some point in June. We don't have the official system requirements yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade | 4K NVIDIA DLSS Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6rVjbzIwc8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, we have the most recently announced game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tides of Annihilation</a>. This action/adventure title inspired by Arthurian myths is in development at Eclipse Glow Games with the Unreal Engine 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tentatively slated for a 2026 launch</a>. In the trailer, we see it running at up to 359 frames per second with the aid of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHuUw_UyyRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, all these trailers were captured on the new NVIDIA flagship GPU, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Moreover, they will have selected Performance Mode at 4K resolution to maximize frame rates. Still, even with these small caveats, they are impressive frame rate figures. We'll still have to wait to actually play the games before judging their smoothness, though, as stuttering could nonetheless mar even a high frame rate experience.</p>
