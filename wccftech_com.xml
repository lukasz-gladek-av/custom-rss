			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> of <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong> at the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 Showcase, developer Liquid Swords has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3634520/view/524236943144256435?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a detailed FAQ</a> on what players can expect in the game.</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established Liquid Swords</a>, the studio confirmed that there will be elements inspired by two of that team's most renowned titles: Mad Max and Just Cause. When it comes to the latter, Just Cause players will recognize an emphasis on physicality, momentum, and emergent systems interaction, although Samson won't feature an exaggerated spectacle and chaos for its own sake, opting for a more grounded approach instead. As for Mad Max, this new game reminds it with its heavy, personal melee combat as well as the vehicle combat mechanics, although of course there are many differences due purely to the setting. </p>



<p>Beyond the comparisons with those games, Samson's combat, whether on foot or on a vehicle, rejects stylization in favor of functional, purposeful violence. Rather than accessing predetermined weapon loadouts, players will utilize environmental tools (wrenches, tires, brick piles, to name a few) and create opportunities through improvisation. There's a large variety of melee weapons and these can be stored in vehicle trunks for tactical preparation, but the surroundings always provide immediate alternatives. Damage carries visual and mechanical weight; impacts break environmental elements and visibly mark both the player character and enemies.</p>



<p>Driving is a key component of Samson. Liquid Swords stressed that vehicle handling emphasizes weight, impact, and physical sensation, with intentional differentiation between vehicle types. Players can drive any vehicle they find, although strangely, the developers explicitly mentioned that civilians won't be removed from the vehicles, unlike in Grand Theft Auto. That seems to suggest the player character would be effectively kidnapping them, too, although that is unconfirmed at the moment. Of course, stealing will elicit a response from law enforcement that escalates further based on the player's actions. But other NPCs react, too, responding differently to aggression (fighting back or fleeing).</p>

<p>Samson is priced at just <strong>$24.99</strong>, so it makes sense that the main narrative would be relatively short. While the game offers freedom to explore the open world, the experience won't be virtually endless, focusing instead on missions and the overarching story (Samson's attempt to pay off his debt as the clock goes against him). Indeed, Liquid Swords confirmed it should take around <strong>10 hours</strong>, but side content can bump that to approximately <strong>25 hours</strong>. These include vehicle-based jobs such as high-stakes hits, underground races, and daring getaways, as well as theft, hand-to-hand combat, and tailing missions to gather critical information. Completing these jobs will contribute to the player progression system, which includes skills and perks that support various playstyles.</p>



<p>There won't be any difficulty settings, so players will have to experience the game's level of challenge as it was intended by the creators. Finally, Liquid Swords acknowledged the challenges of optimizing an open world game, but claimed that they have been working on it since the beginning and also received the support of Epic Games (Samson is powered by Unreal Engine 5).</p>



<p>The objective is to launch in early 2026 on PC, with console versions following later due to the team's small size.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Rest for the Wicked Together Co-Op Update Launches January 22, 2026, But You Can Test It Now]]></title>

			<p>Independent developer Moon Studios (known for the Ori franchise) unveiled the launch date of <strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong>, the long-awaited online co-op update for the action RPG currently in early access, during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIqY6Sszcw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Wicked Inside' livestream</a>. The patch will go live on <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, but you can test it right now thanks to a limited time Open Beta test that runs through Monday, December 22. </p>



<p>The developers have introduced the co-op implementation as a response to the structural limitations inherent in contemporary action RPG multiplayer modes. According to Moon Studios founder and CEO Thomas Mahler, each of the current modes, like host-guest, adding random players, or summoning them FromSoftware-style, fails because they lack "the feeling that we think most players always desire to have when playing an RPG together with others."</p>



<p>The design the studio settled on is, instead, a combination of the systemic depth and meaningful personal interaction of traditional ARPGs with the persistent, shared-world architecture of MMORPGs, while avoiding the subscription requirements and always-online dependencies of the latter. The ambitious goal is to evoke "the magical feeling of playing your very first D&amp;D campaign".</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, No Rest for the Wicked Together operates through <strong>persistent shared realms</strong>. When a player first creates a realm and invites friends, that realm becomes permanently accessible, independent of any host's connection status. This is akin to Minecraft's realm model. Up to four players can simultaneously inhabit a specific realm. With this structure, one player may undertake quests solo while companions are offline, and their actions remain visible upon their friends' eventual return. <strong>Community chests</strong> serve as asynchronous trading mechanisms, which is particularly valuable when fellow players have different playing schedules. </p>



<p>Moreover, rather than individuals owning separate residences, the party collectively purchases a shared home and establishes granular permissions: full access for some chests, private storage for others, shared crafting tables and refineries available to all members. Moon Studios also confirmed that the Crucible, the roguelike area that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-update-revamps-crucible-improves-combat-and-adds-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally revamped shortly after the early access debut</a>, supports full cooperative play. When it comes to combat, the developers warned that enemies and bosses in multiplayer get new AI behaviours, so they may require tactical adjustments to be defeated.</p>



<p>While No Rest for the Wicked Together is clearly focused on co-op multiplayer functionality, the patch will also introduce various improvements that will be equally interesting to those who prefer to play solo. For example, higher-tier items now guarantee superior enchantment rolls with increased slot quantities; weapons now possess random critical strike chances; all enemies now support backstab mechanics; the bows' projectile behavior now fundamentally changes based on the equipped quiver type; the hardest difficulty tier introduces higher enemy density, based on community feedback.</p>

<p>No Rest for the Wicked launched in <strong>April 2024</strong> on early access and immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed a lot of potential</a>.  However, it didn't quite achieve the same level of success the studio had hoped for. Even though SteamDB suggests sales are between a million and a million and a half units, Moon Studios founder and CEO Thomas Mahler issued a desperate plea to its community, asking for help to improve the Steam user review score, although he later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> that the studio was not actually in immediate danger of closing down.</p>



<p>The game still doesn't have a launch window for version 1.0. When the full game launches, Moon Studios plans to release it on consoles as well, although they <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-might-initially-skip-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while back</a> that Xbox might be skipped due to 'market conditions' (the platform's declining sales). No Rest for the Wicked is currently 30% off as part of the Steam Winter Sale, by the way.</p>
