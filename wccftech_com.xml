			<p>Back in the late 90s, after releasing some amazing games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, Squaresoft was the undisputed king of Japanese role-playing games. The publisher's dominance in the genre, however, did not stop other Japanese publishers known for releasing some absolute bangers in other genres from launching their own takes on the genre, like Konami, which released the first entry in the Suikoden series back in late 1995 in Japan. While the game directed by Yoshitaka Murayama wasn't particularly different from most traditional JRPGs, it set itself apart from the competition by tackling some pretty mature themes for the time, but the rise of polygonal 3D graphics, and a Western release date too close to that of Final Fantasy VII severely impacted the game's audience. No one at the time, however, could have predicted that the game would turn into a full-blown series, counting five main entries and a few spin-offs that would attract a loyal and enduring following, even after the series was clearly done.</p>
<p>While the series' creator Yoshitaka Murayama, who sadly passed away <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-series-creator-eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-scenario-writer-yoshitaka-murayama-has-passed-away/">last year</a>, moved on to create <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review-the-last-bow/">another franchise</a> that serves as a spiritual successor to the Konami series, Konami has finally decided to bring back the series after a very long hiatus and offer modern audiences a chance to play both the original Suikoden and Suikoden II on modern platforms with Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster collection that does its job quite well, but whose real value lies in the quality of the original games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250221183259_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For those who have already played the two games, let's get one thing out of the way: Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars is a competent remaster that, maybe, could have done something more. Both games have received a considerable visual uplit, as every location has been faithfully recreated over the original games with higher resolution art and sprites, which have been left untouched over the original aside from receiving an obvious resolution bump, and new animated elements that help bring the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowstone to life like never before. Character portraits have been completely redone in Suikoden I to bring them to a similar level of quality as those featured in Suikoden II, which have received some light touch-ups but no major overhaul. The soundtrack of both games was left untouched, which is not a bad thing at all, considering how amazing they both are to this day, and the only proper improvement in the audio department is ambient noises, which add a little bit of color to the entire game and help immersion, especially in the many dramatic sequences where music is absent.</p>
<p>In addition to the visual uplift and the small audio improvements, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars features a few other enhancements, including a redone UI for both games, which is quite welcome, three difficulty options, and some other quality-of-life changes, including the ability to speed up battles, and a toggleable auto-battle option that allows players to either play multiple turns using the auto option or cancel it to input commands manually the following turn. While the difficulty options are welcome, and Hard difficulty can be a little challenging, especially at the beginning of the two games, where the player has limited resources and lacks access to the most powerful Stars of Destiny, the other two combat improvements leave something to be desired. Speeding up battles essentially speeds the entire game up, meaning that you will also have to listen to sped-up versions of the combat themes, which is so bad that I avoided using the option as much as I could, something that did not impact the experience too much since both Suikoden I and Suikoden II feature a snappy combat system that doesn't waste too much time playing out characters' actions. The new Auto Battle feature, on the other hand, is way more useful, but unfortunately, activating it forces a small black bar on the lower part of the screen that indicates Auto Battle is on, which is a little distracting and immersion-breaking. One final extremely welcome quality of life improvement exclusive to Suikoden II is the Turn Off EVen TImer option, which removes the time limit for certain events, such as Clive's sidequest.</p>
<p>The biggest improvement besides the improved visuals featured in Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars are the localization improvements. While the English localization was overall fine in the original game, though not stellar in any capacity, it was truly awful in Suikoden II, featuring some repeated dialogues, poor wording, and sentence structure that sometimes made it difficult to even understand what characters were saying. Both games have received a new English localization that flows much better in the first game, and that finally makes sense in the second game, making the story shine even more than it did back in the day, even with the horrible localization and all. Unfortunately, there are times when modern slang slips in that feels completely out of place, such as when Viktor calls Gremio a "drama queen" early in Suikoden I, but thankfully they aren't that frequent.</p>
<p>While the above is a solid selection of improvements, as I got reacquainted with the Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, I couldn't help but feel that something more could have been done, aside from fixing the music speeding up in battle when increasing combat speed. For starters, an option to speed up field traversal would have been welcome, as would a random encounter toggle. While the two games don't have a high random encounter rate, the way they handle fighting weak enemies, who can be Let Go at the start of any turn without any penalty, it just would have made sense to give players the option to turn encounters off completely to speed up the already excellent pace of both games. With so many playable characters available, any option to improve character management would also have been welcome, especially in Suikoden I.</p>

<p>Even though something more could have been done to improve the two games, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars is still a collection that every JRPG should be getting for a very simple reason: the high quality of both games. While the original Suikoden may feel a little too traditional, even with some of its unique quirks, Suikoden II is, simply put, one of the best Japanese role-playing games ever released, taking everything the original game did and bringing it up to eleven. In my opinion, it stands head-to-head with more popular JRPGs of the late 90s, like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII, and Xenogears, and even surpasses them in some areas. It is a game that every fan of the genre should experience at least once.</p>
<p>At a glance, Suikoden I and its sequel don't look that different. Both are traditional top-down 2D JRPGs where players explore the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowston as the story dictates, alternating between towns and villages and dungeons as required. While both experiences are fairly linear, their traditional world maps sometimes allow players to branch out in search of new companions to recruit, the 108 of Destiny, who can join the main, mandatory story characters in battles, or provide significant help during Army Battles, which are played as some sort of rock-paper-scissor game in the first Suikoden and as a tactical turn-based RPG in the second, or new services at the Headquarters. The straightforward turn-based combat system is made more remarkable by the large parties of up to six members, the ability to use combinations attacks with certain characters called Unite Attacks, and its general fast speed. At some point during both games, certain characters will also be involved in duels, one-on-one fights that employ a rock-paper-scissor system and feature a sort of cinematic feel that looks great even with the dated and simple 3D backgrounds. Enriching both games are dungeons with a solid design featuring some puzzles, a decent wealth of mini-games that provide some variety, though the RNG dice game Chinchirorin remains as annoying as ever.</p>
<p>What truly makes Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars stand out even today with their relatively straightforward gameplay are their stories, which were, in many ways, groundbreaking for the time. Even with its relative simplicity, Suikoden I laid the thematic groundwork that would get further developed in its sequel, not shying away, as already mentioned, from dealing with some pretty dark and mature themes like the reality of war, often shown without any sort of filter, prejudice, and racism, duty, honor and sacrifice transcending every bond.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250302235643_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Suikoden II goes even deeper with these themes, featuring some chilling sequences that get etched into the player's memory and heart, all the while, much like its predecessor, balancing them out with considerably less dark sequences. What makes Suikoden II the best entry in the series and one of the best JRPGs of all time, elevating it past its already solid predecessor is its cast. The incredible main trio of protagonists - the main character, Nanami and Jowy -, the way their personal stories intertwine not only with the war between the City-States of Jowston and the Highland Kingdom but also with the overarching series' story of the 27 True Runes and the personal conflicts of other story-significant characters are a massive highlight of the experience, and how they get resolved, no matter the ending reached, are capable of moving pretty much anyone who has the chance of experiencing them first hand. All of this is massively improved by the incredible and diverse soundtrack, whose standout piece, the beautifully melancholic Reminiscence, is only the tip of the audio iceberg.</p>
<p>But if there is one character that is the true standout of the Suikoden II cast is one of the main villains, the infamous Mad Prince of the Highland Kingdom, Luca Blight. This psychopath, who can only be described as a demon in human skin, is rightly considered one of the best villains ever seen in JRPG, and for good reason, surpassing other known JRPG madmen like Kefka and Sephiroth by engaging in the most heinous of war crimes only because he had the authority and the power to do so, all while delivering some unforgettable speeches that truly send shivers down the spine. Going against the tendency of the time, which still holds true today, to make JRPG villains grey, the absolute evil that Luca Blight shows whenever he appears on screen, and even offscreen at times, is a refreshing breath of air nowadays, a testament of the genius and courage of Yoshitaka Murayama and the entire writing team.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars definitely succeeds at updating the two classic JRPGs while staying faithful to the original games' art direction, although a few more options and quality-of-life features wouldn't have hurt. Even if the remaster somehow failed to deliver a quality updgrade, however, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars would have been a worthy purchase for any JRPG. The two classic games have stood the test of time incredibly well and still provide extremely compelling gameplay enriched by charming casts and thought-provoking stories that are still worthy of experiencing in 2025 as they were back in the late 90s.</p>

			<p>Today, Rockstar has released the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V PC update</a>, which the developer dubbed GTA V Enhanced. This free update is effectively a new version of the game, as you can check in your Steam or Epic Games Store library, where the previous version is now labeled as GTA V Legacy. The distinction makes sense, as the new version has much higher system requirements compared to the original version.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong><br>
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>
OS: Windows 10 (latest service pack)<br>
Processor: Intel Core i7-4770 | AMD FX-9590<br>
Memory: 8 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1630 (4GB VRAM) | AMD Radeon RX 6400 (4GB VRAM)<br>
Storage: 105 GB available space<br>
Sound Card: DirectX 10 Compatible<br>
Additional Notes: SSD Required |*Compatible PC and/or device required. 3D Audio via Windows Spatial Sound compatible audio systems</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong><br>
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>
OS: Windows 11<br>
Processor: Intel Core i5-9600K | AMD Ryzen 5 3600<br>
Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (8GB VRAM) | AMD Radeon RX 6600XT (8GB VRAM)<br>
Storage: 105 GB available space<br>
Sound Card: Windows Spatial Sound-compatible audio system; solution containing Dolby Atmos support required for a Dolby Atmos experience<br>
Additional Notes: SSD with DirectStorage compatibility</p>
<p>It's also important to make sure your configuration is up for it since progress can be copied from the Legacy version once, and while you will be able to continue playing from where you left off in GTA V Legacy, progress cannot be copied back. This goes for both Story Mode and GTA Online progress, including Characters, GTA$, Progression, Stats, Vehicles, Properties, Weapons, Clothing, and Player-Created Jobs.</p>
<p>Let's review the bulk of the new features available in GTA V Enhanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing support, including reflections and shadows (previously released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X) and the PC-exclusive global illumination and ambient occlusion</li>
<li>Upscaling support for AMD FSR 1 and 3 and NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>Faster load times powered by DirectStorage support</li>
<li>Enhanced 3D audio with support for Dolby Atmos (for those with compatible sound systems) and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
<li>Support for the DualSense controller's Adaptive Triggers feature, which is enabled to let the player feel directional damage, weather effects, rough road surfaces, explosions, and more</li>
<li>General optimization</li>
</ul>

</figure>


<p>First things first. Rockstar still didn't add support for High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) displays, which is underwhelming in 2025. The NVIDIA App does not recognize the new version yet, and therefore, tweaking the ApplicationStorage.json file to implement the new DLSS 4 transformer models is not possible. At least Rockstar added built-in support for DLAA, which can be selected directly in-game.</p>
<p>Each ray tracing setting (shadows, reflections, global illumination, and ambient occlusion) can be individually enabled and set up to Ultra. There's also an extra setting called Scene BVH Quality, which maxes out at Very High. Those are the only new settings in the graphics menu. For the testing on my rig (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition), I pushed every setting to the max, including High-Resolution Shadows and Extended Shadows Distance.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA V Enhanced 4K DLAA RT Maxed Gameplay - RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9cMF8tgUvrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After jumping into the game, the visual upgrade over the vanilla version of Grand Theft Auto V was immediately clear. By far the two most impactful enhancements are ray traced global illumination and reflections, which literally elevate the graphics of most scenes to an entirely new level of fidelity. Of course, when you look closely, you can still see that the models and textures are from a relatively old game. For that, you'll need to use mods, though that might only fly for the single-player mode now that Rockstar has <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the kernel-level anti-cheat BattlEye to combat cheating in GTA Online.</p>
<p>Still, there's no doubt that GTA V Enhanced is the best the game has ever looked. On the aforementioned rig, the game also runs smoothly, even without Frame Generation (which should be added in a future update, said Rockstar), reaching 123 average frames per second in a free-roaming session of around 20 minutes. Support for NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation could potentially triple this result. I would be particularly interested in bumping these 1% low and 0.1% Low to get a more consistent experience, though.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-04-224951-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>GTA V Enhanced is definitely a way to entice players to get back into the game just as GTA VI looms on the horizon, but one could also take it as a positive sign for the next game's PC version, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to launch sooner than expected in early 2026. Support for modern features like ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS/AMD FSR (and soon Frame Generation), Dolby Atmos, and the DualSense controller is a step in the right direction for a developer that has too often relegated PC users to second-class citizens, as evidenced by the huge delay of this 'Next-Gen' update compared to consoles.</p>
<p>However, there's still work to do. For example, whether you own the game on Steam or the Epic Games Store, you still need to pass through the dreaded Rockstar Games Launcher and this affects the DLSS version, too, since the Launcher replaces the DLSS file with the default version if you've updated it to a newer one. Thankfully, there's already a mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/gta5/mods/1199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on the Nexus</a> that monitors the GTA V Enhanced process and replaces the DLSS file automatically when the game is started, restoring it to the original upon quitting the game. This is exactly the kind of stuff that annoys PC gamers; Rockstar should take note for GTA VI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/acclaim-returns-from-the-dead-with-a-focus-on-supporting-indie-studios-and-original-ip/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Acclaim was once an incredibly important company within the games industry, and it soon became legendary after being founded in 1987 for helping to publish titles such as Mortal Kombat, Turok, and NBA Jam. After more than two decades, Acclaim is making a return and has come back with a bold and brave mission in the face of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">tumultuous industry</a>.</p>
<p>The publisher is making a comeback with a focus on supporting indie developers, as well as helping to reignite beloved classic franchises. In this, Acclaim will provide the necessary resources which includes funding, marketing and PR support to independent studios that otherwise wouldn't have been given the opportunity to do so in a highly saturated and chaotic market.</p>
<p>One of the main goals Acclaim will have going forward is to resurrect some classic IP out there that has been enjoyed over the years by a global audience. To be able to make this work, Acclaim has assembled an advisory board with some of the most esteemed industry leaders, such as Russell Binder at Striker Entertainment, Mark Caplan at Ridge Partners, and Jeff Jarrett at Global Force Entertainment.</p>
<p>To ensure the longevity of the company going forward, Acclaim has key partners in Phil Toronto, Partner at VaynerFund, and Eric Vogel, Partner at JET Management, which will help the publishing company foster a healthy investment environment for everyone involved.</p>
<p>"For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the '80s and '90s," says two-time Hall of Fame wrestler Jeff Jarret. "From my early involvement with the publisher's 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>In addition to these industry legends, Alex Josef is spearheading the relaunch of Acclaim as CEO, an industry veteran who has over two decades of experience in marketing and game publishing across PC, console, and mobile.</p>
<p>"It's an absolute honor and pleasure to be leading the charge in bringing Acclaim back to the forefront of the games industry," said Alex Josef. "We're fortunate that we have an extremely talented team and that we've already signed some incredible indie titles, which we'll be revealing soon."</p>
<p>The website for Acclaim has its missions at the forefront, as well as a tab for <a href="https://playacclaim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its games</a>, which will be coming soon.</p>
