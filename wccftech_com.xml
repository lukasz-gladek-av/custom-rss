			<p>At the time of this writing, Heart Machine, the studio behind games like Hyper Light Drifter, Solar Ash, and more recently, Hyper Light Breaker, is less than two weeks from releasing its next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-next-game-possessors-release-date-november-pc-ps5/">Possessor(s)</a>. It's also reportedly just had its second wave of layoffs in less than a month.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">Game Developer</a>, after the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-layoffs-hyper-light-breaker-development-ending/">confirmed a wave of layoffs at the beginning of October</a>, along with halting further development on Hyper Light Breaker, more former developers from Heart Machine have taken to social media to confirm that they've been laid off in a second wave this month.</p>



<p>At least four now former Heart Machine developers took to Bluesky to confirm they have been laid off, with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yiyiwzhang.bsky.social/post/3m4dxhba5ds2x">one even posting a video</a> where they paint a particularly dark picture of the shape the studio is in, saying, "<em>Heart Machine has just laid off a bunch more people, effective immediately. By the time Possessor(s) comes out on November 11th, I don't know if anyone who worked on the game will even be at the company anymore</em>.<em> That's game dev.</em>" The post captions the video "<em>Layoffs at Launch: that's game dev</em>."</p>







<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mllepilgrim.bsky.social/post/3m4c2kazjfk2n">Another post reads</a>, "<em>My heart is heavy and I might have more to say on that later, but I've got news today that my time at Heart Machine will come to an end after Possessor(s) ships. I'm honestly too busy...literally shipping the game to start actively looking for work, but I'll be looking for my next gig in December</em>."</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/virum.bsky.social/post/3m4dmk3tgqs2w">One of the developers impacted by the layoffs</a> had been with Heart Machine for nearly six years before being cut this month. Beyond those who've posted, it is unclear how many developers have been impacted in this round. The studio has yet to make a formal statement akin to the one it made earlier this month, although with the launch of Possessor(s) so close, the studio may just be waiting until after the game has launched to comment further on its status.</p>



<p>Game Developer also pointed out that this isn't just the studio's second layoff in less than a month, but also <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">its third layoff in less than a year</a>.</p>



<p>To call these layoffs 'unfortunate' barely covers it. Heart Machine is a rarity in the modern industry as an indie studio that has stuck around for over a decade, with Hyper Light Drifter being one of the more beloved indie games in the last fifteen years. Now, it seems to be barely getting Possessor(s) out the door; its follow-up to the indie game that put the studio on everyone's radar will never really leave early access, and it doesn't feel unrealistic to say the studio might not make it to the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Hopefully, of course, that's not the case and the studio can find a path to survival once Possessor(s) has launched.</p>

			<p>Yellow paint to indicate the way to players is among the controversial features of modern video games, but no matter how heated the debate gets, some developers, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, feel there's definitely a need for it.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/">GamesRadar+</a>, Hamaguchi-san acknowledged the debate among players while also saying that there's definitely a need for yellow paint in games in many ways. The difference, however, is in how it is implemented.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed," </em>Hamaguchi-san explained. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'no, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</em></p>



<p>As there are all sorts of players, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director's stance on the yellow paint discussion is entirely understandable, as it aims to make complex games with sprawling worlds more accessible to all. </p>



<p>Still, having the option to turn these indicators in some way would be welcome. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/92">While PC users can sometimes resort to mods</a>, offering similar toggles on consoles would likely satisfy the concerns of the community. <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">As the third and final entry in the Remake trilogy is expected to be even larger</a>, it will be interesting to see how Hamaguchi and his team manage the balance between guidance and player freedom.</p>
