			<p>South Korean publisher WEMADE MAX and developer MADNGINE have unveiled a new open world action RPG called Project TAL with a stunning trailer. </p>



<p>In this single player game, which is currently scheduled to arrive on PC and consoles in 2027, players will explore a reimagining of Korea's traditional Tal masks and the mythology and folklore surrounding them. Project TAL features cinematic and fast-paced combat where players can leap onto massive monsters to deliver powerful attacks, exploit enemy weak spots, and perform tactical counterattacks and skill combos.</p>



<p>One of the game's core features is a companion system that responds dynamically to the player’s combat style and the environment. Each NPC companion featured in the game has unique abilities, personalities and combat roles ranging from defence and support to melee, ranged and magic. Players will experience seamless moments of cooperation in Project TAL, such as catching a falling companion in the heat of battle or witnessing a support companion deploy a magical barrier to deflect enemy attacks away from the party.</p>



<p>Sohn Myun-seok, CEO of WEMADE MAX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Project TAL combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG. With MADNGINE’s technical expertise and artistic vision, we’re creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage.</em></p>

<p>WEMADE MAX and MADNGINE previously worked together on the MMORPG Night Crows, which launched in Korea in 2023 and globally last year. However, Project TAL is a far cry from it, being a single player action-oriented roleplaying game for PC and consoles, whereas Night Crows is an MMORPG for PC and mobile with blockchain-powered play-to-earn features.</p>



<p>According to the press release, MADNGINE has recently established a 'multi-production creative structure' to develop multiple new franchises, such as Project TAL. Going forward, it will focus on high-end genres, platform diversity and technological scalability.</p>

			<p>Today, publisher Plaion and developer Warhorse Studios announced that the final story DLC planned for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released on November 11.</p>



<p>In this expansion pack, Henry, the game's main character, becomes Sigismund Albicus's assistant. Albicus is a renowned healer with ties to King Wenceslas himself. Henry is tasked with a clandestine mission within the monastery's ancient walls and finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue and a deadly, mysterious plague, where each faction harbours its own hidden motives.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II players can explore the fascinating Sedletz Monastery and meet its elusive inhabitants. A sudden epidemic has hit the area, and it is imperative to discover its origin. Warhorse promises a rich, cinematic quest that will test the player's deductive and sleuthing skills.</p>



<p>Unraveling the secrets of Sedletz Monastery will require interacting with its inhabitants and discovering their hidden agendas. They will engage with various factions, each with its own motivations, and shape the course of events with their decisions. Players will traverse the diverse areas of the historically accurate Sedletz Monastery, gradually unlocking new sections as they solve mysteries and uncover hidden secrets. As you would expect from such a DLC, the developers have introduced new outfits, weapons, potions and books to expand Henry's knowledge and abilities.</p>

<p>Mysteria Ecclesiae can be purchased at $13.99 on its own, or as part of the Expansion Pass, which is priced at $29.99. That also includes the other two previously released story DLCs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-brushes-with-death-story-dlc-out-now-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brushes with Death</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-legacy-of-the-forge-dlc-update-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy of the Forge</a>. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition owners will get Mysteria Ecclesiae automatically, since the Gold Edition includes the Expansion Pass.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been a great success for both Plaion and Warhorse Studios, having sold over three million units to date. The game also received outstanding acclaim from critics, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a perfect score from Wccftech's Chris Wray</a>.</p>
