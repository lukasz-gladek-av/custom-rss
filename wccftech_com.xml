			<p>Ghost of Yotei will launch in early October on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, a new trailer shared today confirmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBLJYjSAhg&amp;t=2s">The new trailer</a>, which can be watched below, confirmed the game will launch on the current generation PlayStation consoles on October 2nd worldwide. Besides confirming the release date, the new trailer also provides a new look at the Yotei Six, gang members that Atsu has sworn to hunt down. Needless to say, the game is looking great and is a considerable step up from Ghost of Tsushima, which was originally released on PlayStation 4 and was later ported to PlayStation 5 and PC to offer improved visuals and more.</p>

			<p>New Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mods released today introduce two new full-fledged playable characters as well as new abilities for playable Sephiroth.</p>
<p>Following the video preview shared <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-playahble-characters-pc/">last week</a>, D3DNieR released today on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> a new <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=description">mod</a> that introduces playable versions of Reno and Rude. The two new characters, which replace Cloud and Tifa, have some small issues, but they feel like proper playable characters with some unique mechanics, such as Rude's ability to use more basic attacks after using the Unbridled Strength skill, the ability to cancel some animations by pressing the strong attack button, a counterattack, and much more.</p>
<p>While Sephiroth has been made playable past the flashback sequence at the beginning of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth already, his moveset is considerably limited compared to the other playable characters. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/980?tab=videos">The new mod</a> released by Eulymedon today, however, partially addresses this issue by introducing abilities taken from the boss version of Sephiroth, including Heartless Angel, Errant Whisper, Wicked Augment, and more. You can check how these abilities work in the video below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-suggesting-release-may-be-imminent.1171119/</guid>

			<p>Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan today, suggesting that, judging from some precedents, the game may not be too far from release.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu, the second entry in the series developed by Sucker Punch received an R rating for violence, tobacco and alcohol and inappropriate language, which was predictable looking at the first entry in the series. While the rating also highlights how a launch date has not been revealed yet, we are likely going to hear more about it very soon, as not much time usually passes from the first ratings in Asian countries to the release date announcements. For Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, another big PlayStation 5 exclusive launching in 2025, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">launch date</a> was confirmed a little over a month after the game was rated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">South Korea.</a></p>

<p>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1914870872667488508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We haven't seen much of Ghost of Yotei since its announcement last year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gets-new-details-from-official-website/">Back in March</a>, the game's official website confirmed some details regarding the new protagonist, Atsu, and some new gameplay mechanics, including new weapons like the odachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas, more varied environments that players will be able to take advantage of, and more.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is scheduled to release in 2025 on PlayStation 5. A PC version has yet to be officially announced, though there's little doubt that a port will be coming at some point.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oblivion Remastered Seems to Be Rather Well-Suited to Mods, and One of Them Adds Ray Reconstruction]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction.1171077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Shortly following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and release</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, the legion of Elder Scrolls modders jumped on it to see what could be done. There seems to be good news: since the game logic still runs on the original Gamebryo engine, several of the mods made for the original game are being ported and appear to be working. The usual Bethesda plugin structure based on .esp files is also intact, so users can simply add new mods (.esps) to the data folder and then make sure to also add the .esp name to the plugins.txt file.</p>
<p>In the span of mere hours, there are already around ninety mods on Nexus. Some of these are simple, run-of-the-mill skip-the-intro mods, but others are far more interesting. For example, modder sammilucia has already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> a version of their Ultra + mod, which was previously released for many PC games (Hogwarts Legacy, RoboCop: Rogue City, Silent Hill 2 Remake, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Ghostrunner 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Avowed, Runescape: Dragonwilds, Black Myth: Wukong). Interestingly, this mod adds NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction to Oblivion Remastered, which is not supported by default (DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation are natively available, though). The game offers hardware-accelerated ray traced Lumen global illumination, and Ray Reconstruction can boost its quality. Ultra + also makes other tweaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved fog quality</li>
<li>Fix fog ghosting</li>
<li>Fix fog artifacting against the sky</li>
<li>Include fog in Lumen tracing for GI and reflections</li>
<li>Increase lighting quality in general via modifying the game's PostProcessVolumes</li>
<li>Add several lighting quality levels, allowing maximum theoretical lighting quality</li>
<li>Improved reflection quality</li>
<li>Fix screenspace reflection issue when Hardware Lumen is enabled</li>
<li>Performance tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are already many more mods on Nexus. Some attempt to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restore the original game's colors through ReShade presets</a>. Others ensure that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quest rewards are unleveled</a> so that they are always received by the player at their maximum quality.</p>
<p>There are also tweaks to game mechanics, such as equipment degradation, which can either be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> or significantly <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowed down</a>; carry weight can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted to infinity</a>; spell restrictions to spellcrafting or enchanting can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a>; the HUD can be made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleeker and less intrusive</a>. But, as mentioned earlier, arguably the most promising aspect is that Oblivion Remastered appears to be compatible with some original mods, such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/87" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPCs Catch Fire</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horse Whistle - Summon and Follow</a>. It remains to be seen if the same will hold true for more complex mods, but if that were to be true, the game's modding potential could be enormous. We'll keep a close eye on the modding scene's development, that's for sure.</p>
