			<p>In between the other big announcements during today's State of Play presentation, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/">release date and gameplay reveal for Saros</a> and our <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">first proper debut of Marvel's Wolverine</a>, PlayStation took some time to announce the PS Plus Essential games for October, headlined by Remedy Entertainment's excellent Alan Wake 2. We also learned that The Last of Us Part II will be joining the PS Plus Extra game catalog this coming Friday, September 26, 2025, to arrive in time for The Last of Us Day.</p>



<p>Alan Wake 2 will join the service for PlayStation Plus Essential subscribers on October 7, 2025, and joining alongside it will be the indie puzzle game hit Cocoon, and the physics-based comedy game Goat Simulator 3. Their arrival on October 7 also means that you have until October 6, 2025, to add Psychonauts 2, Stardew Valley, and Viewfinder to your library, if you haven't already, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-september-2025-psychonauts-2/">since those are the three games available to subscribers for September 2025</a>.</p>

<p>For PlayStation Plus Extra subscribers, The Last of Us Part 2 is just one of the games getting added to the service for October, with the rest of them surely getting announced within the coming weeks. We just got the news about The Last of Us Part 2 now because of today's State of Play presentation and its proximity to The Last of Us Day.</p>



<p>We also got a look at some of the games joining the Classics Catalog, which is exclusively for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers. Two of the titles are classic fighting games, Tekken 3 and Soulcalibur 3, which were marked as "<em>coming soon</em>" to the service.</p>



<p>The third game announced was the Lara Croft Tomb Raider Anniversary, which was also marked as "<em>coming soon</em>," and could imply that these three titles aren't necessarily what will be added to the Classic's Catalog for subscribers in October. We'll see what the full announcement of the PS Plus Extra and Premium games for October reveals when it arrives in a few weeks time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Is Coming to PS5 This December, PS VR2 Support Arriving in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-is-coming-to-ps5-this-december-ps-vr2-support-arriving-in-2026.1307829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yet another previously Xbox console-exclusive game is making its way to PlayStation, with Microsoft announcing during today's Sony State of Play event that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is coming to PS5 on December 8, 2025. What's more is that at some point in 2026, through a free update, the game will also get support to be playable through PS VR2.</p>



<p>Today's announcement confirms what we've been hearing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-might-be-the-next-xbox-game-coming-to-ps5/">for months now through multiple rumours</a> that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">next game to make the jump</a> from an Xbox console-exclusive to PS5 would be Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Even just last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/">there was a new rumour circulating</a> that Flight Sim was going to make its PlayStation debut sometime soon.</p>



<p>Now, not only do we know that Flight Simulator 2024 is making the trip, the fact that it'll have PS VR2 support means that potentially, the best way to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on consoles in, say, a year's time (depending on when the update arrives), will be on a PS5 with a PS VR2 headset.</p>

<p>"<em>With up to 125 highly detailed aircraft, we have developed the largest and most diverse fleet ever assembled for a flight simulator</em>," writes Jorg Neumann, head of Microsoft Flight Simulator at Xbox Game Studios, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-soars-onto-ps5-dec-8/">in a PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We have</em> <em>an incredibly wide range of aircraft: nimble ultralights</em>, <em>a wide variety of general aviation aircraft, famous bush trip planes, rotorcraft, eVTOLs, airships, steerable balloons, all the way to sleek business jets, a fleet of narrow and wide-body airliners and even heavy military transporters and fighter jets</em>."</p>



<p>This new version will also take advantage of the DualSense controllers haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and it'll come with support for gyro controls to immerse you even more if you don't have a full flight-stick setup.</p>



<p>Now that Flight Simulator is confirmed, and we've already seen the likes of Forza and Gears of War make their way to PlayStation, we're left waiting on games like Starfield, and of course, Halo. At this point, it just feels like it's a matter of time until all of Xbox's first-party games are released on PlayStation a year after they are released on Xbox, if they don't just make them simultaneous releases. </p>

			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-returns-on-september-24-with-35-minutes-of-updates-and-reveals/">Sony State of Play presentation</a> included some major announcements, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-returns-on-september-24-with-35-minutes-of-updates-and-reveals/">gameplay reveal and release date for Saros</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-trailer-provides-new-quick-look-at-story-and-gameplay-confirms-release-date/">confirmation of Nioh 3's release date</a>, and the surprise debut of the campaign in Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>The return of a proper campaign to the Battlefield series is an exciting notion for shooter fans who also appreciated the story modes alongside the multiplayer the series was known for, and it's been disappointing that more recent Battlefield releases have lacked any kind of proper story mode.</p>

<p>You'll step into the boots of the squad members of a troop called Dagger 13, including a cast of characters that each fall into different classes, with Haz Carter as the Assault character, Dylan Murphy as the Engineer character, Simone "Gecko" Espina as the Recon character, and Cliff Lopez as the Support character.</p>



<p>"<em>True to Battlefield, your squad is the key to accomplishing your mission in single player,</em>" writes Roman Campos-Oriola, creative director on the single-player campaign at Battlefield Studios in a PlayStation Blog post.</p>



<p>"<em>You'll be able to command the rest of Dagger 13 to engage enemy forces as a group in order to suppress them as you reposition to snipe, flank them, or take out multiple foes with a well-thrown grenade. Additionally, as you step into the well-worn boots of different members of the squad, you'll be able to take advantage of their respective abilities and talents to gain the upper hand when engaging the enemy</em>."</p>



<p>All that is particularly exciting, because a Battlefield campaign that leverages the game's already excellent first-person shooting, and then adds a solid layer of tactics and strategy gameplay with how you move your squad through encounters sounds like a perfect blend for the kind of campaign experience you could only really find in a Battlefield game.</p>



<p>We'll see what the full release has in store when Battlefield 6 arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025.</p>
