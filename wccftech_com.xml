			<p>Just days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/">NCSoft and Guerrilla Games revealed the long-anticipated MMO</a> set within Sony's Horizon universe, Horizon Steel Frontiers, and it looked like just about everything you might've expected from a Horizon MMO, which is to say that it looks like it'll be extremely fun and exciting to play. But, surprisingly, the reveal carried one glaring omission: it's not coming to PS5; it'll only launch on PC and mobile.</p>



<p>Why a new game made in collaboration with one of Sony's first-party PlayStation Studios, based on a Sony-owned, first-party IP, is not coming to Sony's flagship console is the million-dollar question surrounding Horizon Steel Frontiers, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/960/G096074/20251113059/">Japanese publication 4Gamer</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-steel-frontier-developer-wants-playstation-release-but-its-not-something-we-can-decide-on-our-own">Eurogamer</a>), we get a bit of insight into the answer behind that million-dollar question.</p>



<p>According to NCSoft executive producer Lee Song, the studio has no problem bringing Horizon Steel Frontiers to PS5. In fact, it wants to deliver the game on PS5. So why wasn't PS5 one of the listed platforms when it was revealed? Well, it appears we'll have to ask Sony.</p>



<p>NCSoft has "<em>no reason</em>," Song said, not to bring the game to PS5. "<em>We would like to do it,</em>" he added, "<em>but it is not something we can decide on our own, so we would like to proceed with discussions</em>."</p>



<p>So if NCSoft is gun-ho to bring Horizon Steel Frontiers to PlayStation consoles, the remaining conclusion is that Sony is, for reasons unknown, blocking the game from its flagship console. </p>



<p>Perhaps it will eventually come to PS5, but Sony wants it to launch elsewhere as part of its plans to expand its reach outside of the PlayStation ecosystem on other platforms. Perhaps it figures that there's already a fan base of Horizon fans who will play Steel Frontiers on PS5 whenever it arrives on the console, but it would prefer to try and build a base of players on mobile and PC first, before going to the players it knows will buy into Steel Frontiers whenever it arrives on PlayStation.</p>



<p>Or perhaps Sony doesn't want Steel Frontiers on PlayStation at all, to keep a differentiating line between the experiences it delivers to console and the ones it'll bring to PC and mobile. All we can do is speculate, until Sony provides an answer, if it ever does. But at least we know who to ask.</p>

			<p>We know that Neowiz, the parent company of Round 8 Studio, the team behind<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/"> Lies of P </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture</a>, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-is-getting-balance-tweaks-dlcs-and-a-sequel/">working on a sequel to its Bloodborne-like hit</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/">has sold over 3 million copies since its launch</a>. But a Lies of P sequel isn't the only project that Neowiz has on the go. In fact, it's not even the only Souls-like game Neowiz has in development.</p>



<p>Per the studio's <a href="https://cdn.neowiz.com/neowiz-site/assets/ir-library/3Q25_NWZ-IR-PPT_EN-itjp3znq.pdf">latest investor presentation</a>, it has a total of five projects set to release on PC and consoles in development at its in-house studios. If you add its mobile games, it has seven total projects on the go from its internal teams.</p>



<p>Of those five projects, one of them is the sequel to Lies of P. Another is a new Souls-like project led by Kay Lee at Neowiz. Another is a new narrative-focused RPG led by Seungho Jin, and rounding out the remaining two is a new life simulator game, and a new survival action title.</p>

<p>The company definitely has a lot on its plate, but after Lies of P, it's difficult not to be completely excited for whatever the studio is cooking up. With Lies of P, the studio proved it could enter a highly competitive and, for many players, oversaturated genre and still find ways to improve and innovate on what came before, even if it didn't hit its mark perfectly.</p>



<p>So, hearing that it'll be trying to do that again with both a sequel to Lies of P and an entirely new Souls-like, and it'll be entering the survival-action game genre, and a new life simulation game, sparks further excitement around how the studio could potentially innovate in those genres. At least, that's the hope.</p>
