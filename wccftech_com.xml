			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/acclaim-returns-from-the-dead-with-a-focus-on-supporting-indie-studios-and-original-ip/">announcing its return earlier this year</a>, 90s videogame publisher Acclaim is no longer just a former publisher from the 90s, but a modern-day publisher in today's videogame industry. Today, the company hosted its first PlayAcclaim showcase, where it revealed nine games it is currently publishing, including a 2D action-horror game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032830/Katanaut/">Katanaut</a>, that launched today alongside the showcase.</p>



<p>The other eight titles include a top-down 2D rhythm game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3243370/GRIDbeat/">GRIDBeat!</a>, a combat-focused 2D roguelite called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3815370/Talaka/">Talaka</a>, a 2D platformer called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725470/The_Prisoning_Fletchers_Quest/">The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest</a>, a top-down PowerWash Simulator-like called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2572060/Pixel_Washer/">Pixel Washer</a>, a classic arcade basketball game that lets you play through decades of NBA team rosters called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/819630/Basketball_Classics/">Basketball Classics,</a> an action-roguelite bullet-hell called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570580/Ground_Zero_Hero/">Ground Hero Zero</a>, an isometric delivery game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241560/Tossdown/">TossDown</a>, and last but certainly not least, a trick-focused, snowboarding game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3082730/HYPERyuki_Snowboard_Syndicate/">Hyper Yuki</a>.</p>
