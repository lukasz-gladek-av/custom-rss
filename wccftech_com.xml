			<p>Sony recently filed a patent for a new type of PlayStation controller that could solve some of the biggest issues of current wireless controllers, such as losing power right at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-solar-power-controllers/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJIDShleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHVwVHGQueVMZZupV-8DT_-KIESWvFQMimNqN7_WL90EACfvjRBhqzmNO1g_aem_pn2iGOc8pztrFDDWfs47hQ">Tech4gamer</a>, Sony recently filed a patent called <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025046814&amp;_cid=P21-M80ZRL-19120-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Operation Device</a> which outlines a PlayStation controller sporting a plurality of photovoltaic elements located on its housing and a storage area that accumulates power that will essentially charge the controller with solar energy. The drawing accompanying the patent shows a DualSense controller and where the photovoltaic elements will be placed.</p>

<p>While a solar-powered PlayStation controller sounds nothing more like an interesting idea without any sort of revolutionary application, Sony is aiming to address one of the biggest issues of current wireless controllers: preventing the controller from losing power at the wrong time. With solar power, a wireless controller's battery would never get drained, which would definitely make it enticing over a traditional controller with a limited battery life.</p>
<p>Even though it is hardly a revolutionary controller, Sony has already attempted to evolve the classic PlayStation DualShock controller with the DualSense controller, later bringing further innovation with the premium DualSense Edge controller. Sporting the same adaptive triggers and haptic feedback support of the base version alongside new features, such as swappable sticks, three levels of trigger pulls for the L2 and R2 triggers, and more, the DualSense Edge is the ultimate form of the PlayStation 5 controller.
