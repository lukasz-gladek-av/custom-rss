			<p>With just a few hours left before the official launch of the game <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> announced that the PC version will include support for <strong>DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong>, as well as, of course, for all the linked technologies: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>



<p>According to NVIDIA, owners of a <strong>GeForce RTX 50 Series</strong> graphics card can expect to see their frame rates boosted by an average of <strong>3X</strong> at <strong>4K</strong> with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation enabled (and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode). At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 MFG <strong>enables most GeForce RTX GPUs to reach the in-game maximum threshold of 480 frames per second</strong>, though that's not particularly surprising given that the game is also made for mobile devices (and PlayStation 5). With all this performance headroom, it should be a no-brainer for everyone to activate the <strong>second-generation DLSS Super Resolution Transformer model</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ces-2026-demo-footage-nvidia-dlss-4-5-dynamic-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA unveiled at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> to obtain improved visual quality. For the time being, you'll have to do it via the NVIDIA app, though native in-game support is also in development by Arknights: Endfield developer <strong>HYPERGRYPH</strong>.</p>

<p>The game is a <strong>free-to-play action RPG</strong> with some simulation features thrown in for good measure.

The PC version isn't on Steam, by the way; you can only download the game via the official website's launcher or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arknightsendfield-f0f167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond the Arknights: Endfield news, NVIDIA also shared that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Styx: Blades of Greed</a></strong> supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, too, both in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-demo-out-now-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC demo that's currently out</a> and in the full game, due on February 19. Once again, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-super-resolution-how-to-guide-image-quality-analysis-performance-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution</a> can be enabled through the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Moon Studios will release the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-update-gameplay-trailer-moon-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong> co-op update</a>. The game already natively supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA, and now players can also upgrade to the second-gen Transformer model (DLSS 4.5) through the NVIDIA app for enhanced fidelity, especially when using the Performance and Ultra Performance modes.</p>



<p>Lastly, the indie open world co-op survival game <strong>The Gold River Project</strong>, due to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253220/The_Gold_River_Project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will be released with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, with the option to enable DLSS 4.5 in the NVIDIA app.</p>
