			<p>The recently released Half-Life 2 RTX demo is not only a great showcase of the potential of NVIDIA RTX Remix but also of the DirectX 12 Ultimate Sampler Feedback feature, which has the potential to be quite a game-changer in terms of VRAM usage.</p>
<p>A new video shared earlier this week on YouTube by Compusemble shows Sampler Feedback streaming in action in the demo, showing how the technology can significantly reduce VRAM usage in pretty much every scenario. While the reduced VRAM usage doesn't lead to any significant performance improvement, the technology is definitely impressive and could definitely help improve image quality and performance in games running on GPUs with low VRAM capacity.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Half-Life 2 RTX is an amazing showcase of what can be achieved using NVIDIA's RTX Remix, although the quality of the transformative upgrade is impacted by the change in the atmosphere of the original game. You can learn more about the demo by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/">piece.</a></p>
<p><em>Half-Life 2 RTX boasts amazingly remade assets that show outstanding fidelity even when zoomed upon. In this regard, the team at Orbifold has done incredible work so far. And then, of course, there's the path tracing, boosted by RTXDI and Neural Radiance Cache. The game is completely transformed with them, almost entirely for the better, with bounce lights and indirect lighting illuminating everything they should and bringing the environments to life.</em></p>
<p>The Half-Life 2 RTX demo is now available for download for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam.</a></p>
