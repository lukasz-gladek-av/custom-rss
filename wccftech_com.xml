			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 update launching on all platforms will introduce new content to the RPG developed by Sandfall Interactive released in April 2025.</p>



<p>The new update was confirmed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/506216119584948426?l=english">a new message shared by the studio on Steam</a>, celebrating the game selling 5 million copies, and the original soundtrack composed by Lorien Testard hitting 333 million track streams since its release. This new update, whose release date has yet to be confirmed, will include new content and features according to the developer. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new playable location environment with new enemy encounters and surprises to find.</li>



<li>New challenging late-game boss battles</li>



<li>New costumes for each party member that will also provide new customization options</li>



<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, which will bring the total number of supported languages to 19.</li>
</ul>



<p>New content coming to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is excellent news, as the new challenges will only improve one of the best JRPGs released in the current generation, and, in my opinion, a serious contender for this year's Game of the Year award. You can learn more about why I believe so by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">checking out my</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-close-to-you-short-pikmin-super-mario-galaxy-movie-tease-speculation/">released an animated short titled "<em>Close to You</em>"</a> with absolutely no explanation as to what it could be referring to. There were definite hints, like a blurry Pikmin seen in the background of a shot and the music coming from Pikmin 4, but we couldn't say for certain that it was anything Pikmin-related, or if it potentially had something to do with the Super Mario Galaxy movie, or if it was something else entirely.</p>



<p>Well, today Nintendo answered one of those questions for us. On its Nintendo Today app, the company released a new version of the "<em>Close to You</em>" video, though this time, instead of the little baby's toys and soother appearing to move around by magic, we can see clearly that there were invisible little Pikmin all around the room.</p>



<p>So it is a Pikmin-related project, that much we can say. What that project is, however, is still another question entirely. It could, of course, be the beginning of a marketing campaign that will lead into the release of Pikmin 5. It could also be our first look at a new project from Nintendo's new Nintendo Pictures arm, which would explain why there's been no sign of Illumination or Universal in either of the videos.</p>



<p>If that's the case, then this could potentially be a new film or a new TV series based on Pikmin. At the time of this writing, just like the original version of the video that was posted to Nintendo's social accounts, the Nintendo Today app, and Nintendo's YouTube channels simultaneously, this new version comes with no added explanation as to what it is. It's also still only available to watch on the Nintendo Today app, and has yet to be shared to the aforementioned verticals so far.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll learn even more about whatever this project is soon. Perhaps we just need to wait another day for the full reveal to arrive tomorrow morning.</p>
