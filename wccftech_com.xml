			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation and business segment meeting</a>, the latest update on PlayStation Plus from Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer, Hideaki Nishino, confirmed that Sony will continue to adjust its pricing strategy around PlayStation Plus, as the company is seeing that players are "<em>increasingly choosing our Premium and Extra tiers</em>."</p>
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus has increased twice so far in this generation, with the first major increase happening in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852353/playstation-plus-prices-increase-essential-extra-premium">2023</a> and the next one just a couple of months ago in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">April 2025</a> (though the most recent increase applied only to major regions outside the US).</p>
<p>PS Plus is getting more expensive, and yet, despite the uproar around Sony increasing the price while also <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">seemingly giving players fewer first-party offerings</a> and the snail pace with which games are added to the Classics catalog of games available at the Premium tier, more players are choosing to pay for the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>
<p>"<em>We are focused on driving profitable growth by increasing engagement and appeal, and by continuously improving the service proposition and the content that we offer players and subscribers,</em>" Nishino said.</p>
<p>"<em>As a result, subscribers are increasingly choosing Premium and Extra tiers, which now represent approximately 38% of all subscribers.</em>"</p>

<p>In a separate 'Fireside Chat' video that was released alongside the business segment presentation, Nishino was asked more directly about the PS Plus price increases, and how frequently he sees PlayStation being able to raise the price of the service.</p>
<p>"<em>PlayStation Plus is highly valued by our players and continues to drive engagement</em>," he began. "<em>We are already seeing a trend towards the option of higher tiers within our service, as evidenced by the subscriber mix we achieved in FY2024, where approximately 38% are now subscribed to PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra tier. This is even after the global price increases we implemented in FY2023, and more recently, the local price increases in selected countries to improve our pricing strategy across certain market clusters, and also to account for [foreign exchange] movements</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These price increases were partly a result of increasing value we bring to the players, through the quality and diversity of content we continue to add, as well as investment in features to improve the service further, such as player personalization and enhanced content discovery. The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value, and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability</em>."</p>
<p>Nishino isn't directly confirming that we should expect more price increases, but maximizing profitability for a product, while adding features to it, doesn't usually equal a price decrease for that product.</p>
<p>For how upset players seem to get about the price increases when they happen, the numbers show that, increasingly, there's more who don't care that the price is going up, and want to keep paying for at least the Extra tier to get access to the large catalog of games available at the higher levels of PS Plus.</p>
