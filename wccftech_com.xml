			<p>You might not be able to sandwalk like a Fremen in Dune: Awakening, but there are ways of getting around Arrakis besides your own two feet, including fast travel. </p>



<p>It's not immediately obvious that fast travel is in Dune: Awakening, but it is there. You don't need to use it, though, and there's a real question as to whether you should be using it at all. </p>



<p>This guide will take you through all of that; how fast travel works, where it can take you, and if you should be using it at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-guide-how-fast-travel-works">Dune: Awakening Guide - How Fast Travel Works</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-fast-travel-works-in-dune-awakening">How Fast Travel Works in Dune: Awakening</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unlike other open-world games with large maps to cross, you cannot fast travel whenever you like in Dune: Awakening. It's only available when you make it to your first trade post in the southern region of Hagga Basin. </p>



<p>You can fast travel from any trade post, but it only unlocks once you've reached the first one, Griffin's Reach. Fast travel works by hiring a pilot to fly you to Harko Village, the Harkonnen base on Arrakis, or Arrakeen, the city where the Atreides have taken refuge. Both areas are social hubs where you can meet other players, though more significantly, they house plenty of important NPCs you need to speak to, like advanced-level trainers for Trooper and Mentat skill trees.</p>



<p>It'll cost you 2,500 Solaris for the pilot to fly you to either Harko Village or Arrakeen, but at least your return trip to whichever trade post you'd like to fly back to will be free. The pilot will also be able to fly you to different trade posts in Hagga Basin, such as the Anvil or Pinnacle Station, though there's still a cost to that. A more reasonable 700 Solaris will get you between different trade posts. </p>



<p>You also can't use the pilot to fly you to a trade post you've not been to before. You have to make it there yourself by some other means before being able to fast travel from one trade post to another.</p>



<h3 id="h-should-you-use-fast-travel-in-dune-awakening">Should You Use Fast Travel in Dune: Awakening?</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are two answers to this question, and the one that's right for you depends on where you are in the game. Basically, if you have yet to craft your own ornithopter, then yes, you should be using fast travel, though that's also because you have to. You can't access Arrakeen or Harko Village any other way, save for landing there with an ornithopter.</p>



<p>If you have already crafted your own ornithopter, then you don't need to use the pilot, and you can select travelling to Arrakeen or Harko Village as a form of fast travel, since there's no other way to access either settlement.</p>



<p>When you're going from one trade post to another, unless you're immediately near a trade post and have the 700 Solaris to spare, you might find it better to just get there yourself, especially if you have your own ornithopter. Being able to fly anywhere at any time is the *real* fast travel in Dune: Awakening.</p>

			<p>11 Bit Studios' latest title, The Alters, has been out for nearly a month at the time of this writing, and in that time, the game has surpassed 280,000 copies sold across all platforms, the studio announced. </p>

<p>On the game's<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/502828986443763626?l=english"> Steam page</a>, the studio added, "<em>It's hard to express just how much this means to us. Creating The Alters was a deeply personal journey, and seeing so many of you step into Jan's world, experiencing his choices, reflecting on his struggles, and connecting with his story, has been incredibly moving.</em> <em>Your support, curiosity, and passion make all the difference. Whether you've finished the game or are just beginning, thank you for being part of this adventure.</em>"</p>



<p>The team also ended off on a note that sounds like a tease for more content to come in the future, saying "<em>If you already finished the game, you can be sure that this is only the beginning</em>. <em>Stay tuned and thank you for being with us</em>."</p>



<p>While The Alters launched to critical and consumer praise, a significant portion of the goodwill 11 Bit Studios established with the game vanished when it was uncovered that the team had<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-generative-ai-assets/"> used generative AI tools to fill in certain elements of the game</a>, and seemingly intended to patch them out of the game without saying anything.</p>



<p>Players first noted what appeared to be AI-generated text as part of the background in certain scenes, and then non-English-speaking players noticed that the translations for some of the films the game's protagonist Jan is able to watch on the ship were quite poor and also appeared to be AI-generated. </p>



<p>A few days after players began to notice these aspects, 11 Bit Studios admitted to using generative AI tools as part of its process. In the first instance, where AI-generated text appeared in the background of a scene in the game, it was first put there just as a placeholder, and was never supposed to make it into the final version of the game.</p>



<p>Regarding the film translations, however, 11 Bit Studios made the choice to use AI-generated translations in order to include them in the game for launch. "<em>Due to extreme time constraints,</em>" the studio said in its <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1939707458152448118">statement</a>, "<em>we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game</em>."</p>



<p>Even as the studio couches its use of generative AI by stating how little of the game's text was localized in this way, it still admits, "<em>In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know</em>."</p>
