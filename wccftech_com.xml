			<p>A Fallout New Vegas RTX Remix mod is now in development, aiming to introduce path tracing to one of the most loved entries in the series.</p>



<p>The mod is currently in development by skurtyyskirts, who has provided an overview of what it will feature and a very early look at it. Besides introducing path tracing, which already brings significant improvements in indoor locations but significantly impacts the original atmosphere in outdoor locations, the mod will also introduce new textures that will work better with path tracing. You can take a look at this very early version of the mod below.</p>

<p>Despite having been released 15 years ago, Fallout New Vegas continues to enjoy immense popularity, and it is regarded as one of the finest entries in the post-apocalyptic RPG series. Despite its reputation among fans of the series, the game developed by Obsidian Entertainment never received a sequel, although it is rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/">New Vegas 2 could be a thing in the future,</a> something that may have been facilitated by the fact that Microsoft now owns both Bethesda and Obsidian Entertainment. Sadly, it's been over three years since we heard some rumblings about this potential sequel, so the current status of a game that many would be happy to know it's in development is unknown.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Hitman World of Assassination may have revealed some new details on the system, including a possible hidden system feature.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at the port of the latest entry in the series developed by IO Interactive after having been informed that the game seemingly runs better when lowering the system's resolution. After conducting some tests, the tech experts confirmed that Hitman World of Assassination indeed changes resolution when the system resolution is changed via the system menu, allowing users to enable some sort of Performance Mode by lowering the resolution to 720p. In the GPU-limited Whittleton Creek area, the game is 62.5% faster at 720p, 9.7% faster at 1080p resolution than in 4K resolution, and in the Berlin area, which is similarly GPU-bound, the performance differentials are very similar - 61% faster at 720p, 7% faster at 1080p.</p>



<p>While the discovery of this hidden Performance Mode is quite interesting by itself, there are a few other things that make this unique Hitman World of Assassination feature notable. For starters, the performance difference between 1080p and 4K resolution can only be explained if 4K resolution uses NVIDIA DLSS to upscale the image from a lower resolution, and the around 10% performance difference discovered during testing could very well be the performance cost of upscaling with DLSS from 1080p to 4K resolution. Even more interesting is the fact that the game instantly changes the resolution when the system resolution is changed, which could be a hidden Nintendo Switch 2 system feature,  as the tech experts noted how IO Interactive could have made these display modes options available via an in-game menu if they wished to have them in the game.</p>

<p>Being the first handheld device that uses NVIDIA DLSS, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a very interesting system from a technical standpoint, but each new discovery is making it even more interesting as users delve deeper into what it offers.

			<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-rejects-sony-settlement-over-playstation-game-sales-2025-07-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Reuters</a>, a United States District Court judge from the Northern District of California has rejected a Sony-approved settlement over a PlayStation credits class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs claimed that Sony overcharged for digital games distributed through its monopolized PlayStation Store, and Sony agreed to settle the lawsuit by allocating $7.8 million in PlayStation credits to millions of PlayStation Network users.</p>



<p>However, the judge denied the settlement for a variety of reasons, including the fact that 'coupon settlements' such as this one are 'generally disfavored'.</p>



<p><em>The motion fails to include an estimated recovery had the proposed class prevailed on each claim, and it fails to provide any estimate of the discount applied to the claims. Importantly, though the motion acknowledges the potential damages were smaller than initially contemplated, the motion provides no estimated class recovery given that discovery. These shortcomings alone warrant denial of Cendejas’s motion for preliminary approval because it prevents the Court from meaningfully assessing the fairness of the proposed settlement. Any renewed motion for preliminary approval must include a chart setting forth the anticipated breakdown of the $7,850,000 settlement distribution, including amounts estimated for attorney’s fees, service awards, costs, administration expenses, and other amounts to be paid. From the resulting net settlement amount, Cendejas shall provide a ballpark estimate or range of amounts to be distributed to each Settlement Class Member. </em></p>



<p><em>Moreover, the Settlement calls for Class Members to receive compensation in the form of cash-value PlayStation Network (“PSN”) account credits. The Court views such PSN account credits as settlement coupons, which are generally disfavored. Any renewed motion for preliminary approval must address the propriety of such settlement coupons and whether the value and structure of this settlement remain defensible.</em></p>



<p>For its part, Sony had actually denied any wrongdoing, but added that it was settling to avoid the further expense and distraction of continued litigation. Following this ruling, it remains unclear whether users will actually see those PlayStation credits or not.</p>



<p>A similar lawsuit was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-to-face-7-9-billion-mass-lawsuit-due-to-playstation-store-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in the United Kingdom</a>, although the plaintiffs are asking for compensation orders of magnitude greater than the US one.</p>
