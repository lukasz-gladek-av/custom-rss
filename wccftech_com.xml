			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed</a>, which means we'll have to keep going back to Grand Theft Auto V to get a fix for Rockstar's best-selling franchise. If you're one of the handful of people who have yet to play one of the highest-selling video games ever, it looks like you'll get another chance, at least on PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, Grand Theft Auto V is heading back to the PS Plus Extra games catalogue.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun and Dealabs have a strong track record when it comes to reporting PS Plus games, whether it's one of, or sometimes all three, of the three games offered for the Essential tier, or one of the games entering the catalogue at the Extra tier.</p>



<p>This report pertains to the latter, as we've already had the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/">three games for November at the PS Plus Essential tier</a> revealed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-playstation-plus-november-2025/">one of which Billbil-kun also correctly reported ahead of the official announcement</a>).</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also predicts that this coming Wednesday, November 12, we'll get the official reveal of what games are coming to the PS Plus Extra catalogue, which will include Grand Theft Auto V.</p>



<p>With GTA VI delayed, it lines up perfectly that GTA V would re-enter the PS Plus Extra catalogue, just to make it as accessible as possible for people wanting to remain immersed in the world of Grand Theft Auto on their consoles. It's already available on Xbox Game Pass, so having it back on PlayStation's subscription service just rounds out where players can find it.</p>



<p>Regarding the additional delay for GTA VI, Take-Two boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/">Strauss Zelnick says the company has <em>"never regretted</em>" delaying a game</a>. At least it looks like we'll get another way to play GTA V in the meantime.</p>
