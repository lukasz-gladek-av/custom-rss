			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-studios-very-well-suited-for-hexen-and-heretic-remasters-lead-engine-dev-says/">Nightdive Studios</a> has made it their bread-and-butter to be the team you want remaking and remastering older games. If there's any game you loved when you were a kid that's currently trapped on aging hardware and not easily playable on modern machines, Nightdive is the team you'd want remastering that game.</p>
<p>So far, Nightdive has remastered and remade a number of classics, including its excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/system-shock-remake-shodan-establishes-dominance/">System Shock Remake</a>, The Thing Remastered, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-announces-turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-for-pc-ps5-ps4-switch-and-xbox-one/">Turok</a> franchise, and Star Wars: Dark Forces Remastered, to name a few. The studio has no intention of sticking to games from a certain era, though, and it is looking to take on games from the seventh generation consoles, namely PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/">VGC</a><span>, Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive Studios, said, "<em>We stand ready</em>," on the subject of remastering and remaking seventh-gen games. However, both Kuperman and Stephen Kick, chief executive officer at Nightdive</span>, added that there are plenty of considerations for remastering seventh-gen games.</p>
<p>"<em>I would begin asking a couple of questions,</em>" said Kuperman. "<em>Was it Xbox 360 exclusive, or was there a PC version out too? Because that also changes things, the little preservation that’s available. Do we have source code? If so, what’s the quality of the source code? How about the assets? Those are the kinds of considerations that we have there. That being said, there were some really good games that came out in that era that shouldn’t be lost.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick then used the 2008 first-person shooter Haze as an example of a game that he and the team at Nightdive believe should be remastered.</p>
<p>"<em>To your point, though, with a game like Haze – let’s say hypothetically we had access to that, and that was our big title for 2028, right? – We would go to the original designers, and we would say: ‘It didn’t do as well as you had hoped, I’m sure you’ve had a lot of time to ruminate and to think about what you would have done differently.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick added that, specifically with Nightdive's remaster of System Shock 2, speaking to the original developers solved many of the issues they were working on, as they could hear directly from the original creators what steps Nightdive should take to properly recreate the original vision.</p>
<p>When it comes to remastering seventh-gen games, the big hang-up has never been games that were available on Xbox 360 or PC in that era. The PlayStation 3's unique CELL architecture has been the infamous roadblock that's kept plenty of PS3-exclusive titles landlocked on Sony's old grill-looking console.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge, Kick is certain that Nightdive is up to the task.</p>
<p><em>"I think that architecture – I mean, I remember the talk when the system was first released, of how difficult it was for developers to ‘get’ it – and that’s a big problem with backwards compatibility [...] So yeah, if we get to that – or I should say when – we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face. But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</em></p>
<p>Kuperman also added that part of Nightdive's advantage is their internal engine, which has helped them remaster and remake games from multiple eras of consoles. Hopefully, it turns out to be the ace up Nightdive's sleeve to make them the go-to studio for bringing PS3 games into the modern gaming landscape.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-back-on-that-heist-biz/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the main reasons Wccftech was on-site for GDC 2025 this year was to take part in the first hands-on play sessions for 10 Chambers' upcoming cooperative cyberpunk heist title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den of Wolves</a>. First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Ulf Andersson made his directorial debut with the new studio founded from the ashes of his days designing PAYDAY and PAYDAY 2.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves takes the neo-futuristic approach where corporations are more than people and instead run the world. While you won't see Weyland-Yutani or Arasaka Corp logos on city streets, the sentiment is still very much the same with the megacorps that make up Den of Wolves' setting. As mentioned in my first impressions piece on Den of Wolves, the setting 10 Chambers is working with is a corporate haven known as Midway City, sheltered out in the mid-Pacific that operates outside jurisdictional waters or AI intranets. It's here that a new form of data transmission emerges right out of Johnny Mneumonic's playbook: human brains as cold storage.</p>
<p>Of course, it's quite difficult to convey the concept of brain-jacking and stealing secrets from someone's mind in a two-mission preview, but 10 Chambers gave a decent amount of onboarding to get into the flow of the heists. The first mission began with a smaller prep mission to get in and extract some key items for the larger heist. This played out across a small cluster of individual rooms linked together by closed vault doors where teammates need to regroup back before jumping into the next segmented room. It's a formulaic approach that 10 Chambers designed into the core gameplay loop of the studio's previous game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gtfo-cooperate-or-die-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTFO</a>) that may feel like more of an homage to their previous title than something necessary to crack open some vaults. On the bright side, these discrete rooms do reset the enemy alarms, so players can attempt once more to go for a stealthy approach after getting into an accidental gunfight.</p>
<p>This mini-mission in Den of Wolves resulted in some half-dozen rooms with shorter encounters with a handful of guards and armed combatants on our way to gather some loot bags and head to an elevator for extraction under a constant stream of ever-respawning enemies. It's here that I learned the hard way that these prep missions are an all-or-nothing solution, and all four team members needed to walk out alive for the mission progress to count and what we've picked up to carry over. Sadly, I was the first to go down after foolishly trying to make a break for it and grabbing another loot bag on the way out. I had to lie idly by and watch as groups of five or more guards would spawn one at a time and fill the hallway with bullets, thus preventing my team from making a safe extraction, even if down a member.</p>
<p>Our second mission in Den of Wolves certainly went smoothly by comparison. It was a by-the-numbers vault-busting mission to start with the prep phase letting us swap out our primary and secondary weapons as well as choose an additional equipment tool, like a turret or deployable shield. No glimpse at the character or deeper customization options, so I was limited to the one mask and outfit on hand that were pre-selected for me. Given the sheer number of mask options in the first two PAYDAY titles, I do expect Den of Wolves to bring in a wide range of customization options to incentivize players to keep coming back for heists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves Pre-Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGYfx7vKpRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our team split up into groups of two, each taking one-half of the bank vaults on each side, drilling through a number of vaults to find the sacks of loot we'd then pile up at a massive glass window that would prove to be our one way out. There were a few security guards throughout with more coming in at a drip feed as we made our way to the second part of the mission: diving into our target's brain to gather some crucial data stored in their human brain.</p>
<p>This segment is where Den of Wolves morphs into something I wasn't expecting. In the middle of gunfights, suddenly, our team would be pulled into the mind of the target and forced to run through a 3D parkour gauntlet where reality would rotate on a whim and force our entire squad to endure a running challenge to jump and scramble all the way to an exit point. In those moments, only one of the squad would need to actually be successful, but I wouldn't want to rely on just one person to clear it every time. After a successful dive, we'd be pulled right back into the firefight as if nothing had happened and proceed on as normal with the heist before getting pulled back in another one or two times before extracting all the information we needed from the target's brain.</p>
<p>Coming from GTFO, Den of Wolves feels much more in line with the difficulty curve that heist enjoyers would come to expect from the genre. There are still some obvious growing pains for 10 Chambers to overcome, from creating an enemy AI that's more responsive to flanking maneuvers to gunplay that feels more impactful in each shot. But for those looking for their next heist fix to play with friends online, Ulf Andersson and his team already have a good feel for what their next big move will be. Den of Wolves is currently slated as a PC exclusive without a release date in sight.</p>

			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is setting out to be one of the most visually impressive games launching this year, as the latest iteration of id Software's proprietary engine has fully embraced cutting-edge technology to deliver a complex game world at high performance.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VawgKaIfbg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> shared today, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a first look at what the id Tech 8 engine delivers in the new entry in the series. While the demo that media played did not feature path tracing, it did feature regular ray tracing, which included ray-traced reflections like in DOOM Eternal and ray-traced global illumination in the vein of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,</a> which is powered by the same engine.</p>
<p>Both work extremely well. The Siege map, for example, features a lot of reflective surfaces, which wasn't entirely expected, given the change to a more naturalistic environment over past entries in the series. This change also makes ray-traced global illumination shine, delivering more accurate lighting through vast spaces lit almost entirely with natural light sources like fire and the sun. Additionally, the emphasis on dynamic objects and the removal of baked lighting makes said objects blend more seamlessly into the environment, resulting in a more pleasing visual experience.</p>
<p>Besides ray tracing features and the robust physics simulation DOOM: The Dark Ages features, the game also seems to feature a virtualized geometry system similar to Unreal Engine 5's Nanite. While this couldn't be confirmed at the time, the behavior of some visual elements, such as the absence of LOD swapping, heavily suggests this system is being used. Targeting 60 FPS with this virtualized geometry system in place together with high enemy numbers on screen, the ray-traced lighting and reflections, and the physics simulation show the amazing potential of the id Tech 8 engine. What remains to be seen is how it will actually deliver all this on consoles, but id Software has already proved in the past to have the technical chops to deliver solid experiences on all sorts of hardware.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent.1151010/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, just one week after Ubisoft launched its biggest game of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the company revealed it had formed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">new subsidiary with Tencent</a> that would house its three core franchises, Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, along with the studios that work primarily on those titles.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, an alleged leaked memo from within Ubisoft reported today by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/">Insider-Gaming</a> seems to provide some insight into how things will be changing for the company and the impacted studios moving forward. Insider-Gaming claims the memo is from Ubisoft Montreal general manager Christophe Derennes, who now appears to have taken on the role of 'Zone 1 managing director,' per the new structure the company is shifting to with this new subsidiary.</p>
<p>For now, this memo reveals less about Ubisoft's current plans going forward and instead shows that Ubisoft is still working out exactly how this new subsidiary will be structured. The only thing that seems sure is that big changes will be coming to some of its biggest studios in Canada.</p>
<p>You can read an excerpt from the memo below.</p>
<p><em>What will this mean for us in Zone 1? Certainly, we can expect some major changes in terms of structure and organization, since these three brands compose a significant part of Zone 1’s population. For now, what we can say is that once the agreement is finalized and confirmed by legal authorities, our Quebec, Saguenay and Sherbrooke studios will move entirely to the new entity, while our Montreal project teams will be spread between the new entity and the current Ubisoft organization. Our studios in Toronto, Winnipeg, as well as Red Storm and Blue Mammoth, will continue evolving in the current organization.</em></p>
<p><em>It is still very early in the process and I know you must have many questions, but the short answer to the “what’s next” question is: we need to take the time to figure this out and the next months will be dedicated to determining the transition plan. [...] While there are many things that will only be defined during the planning process over the next few months, I can assure you that Ubisoft will continue to be a world class creator of video games, and your great ideas and energy will always be a critical part of our success.</em></p>
<p>We contacted Ubisoft for a comment on this story but did not hear back in time for publication. If we get a comment, we'll update this story.</p>
