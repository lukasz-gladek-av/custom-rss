			<p>The <strong>State of Gaming 2026</strong> report from global data firm <strong><a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a></strong> is here, looking back on 2025 across several metrics, including which games sit atop the global sales charts - not just regional charts like <strong>Circana's</strong> US-specific reports. We knew that <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game in the US last year</a>, but now Sensor Tower's data confirms it to be the best-selling game on a global scale, and it's not the only <strong>EA</strong> game at or near the top of the charts.</p>



<p><strong>EA Sports FC 25</strong> and <strong>EA Sports FC 26</strong> took the number two and number three spots, respectively, for second and third place among best-selling AAA games. If you combine their sales, they pass Battlefield 6 to take the top spot. EA essentially had the top end of the market locked up from other major players like <strong>Take-Two</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong>. An unsurprising result, considering Sensor Tower's report also puts EA at the top of the publisher list by <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-spent-most-on-ads-2025-ea-biggest-publisher-game-downloads-pc-console-ps5-xbox-steam/">game downloads across PC and console platforms</a>, despite Microsoft spending the most on ads.</p>

<p>When you open it up to more than just AAA games for the top three best-selling games of 2025, the number two and number three spots go to last year's breakout indie hits, <strong>R.E.P.O.</strong> and <strong>PEAK</strong>, in that order. EA Sports FC 25 and<strong> Grand Theft Auto V</strong> round out the rest of the top five.</p>



<p>Even when you move away from premium games and move to <strong>free-to-play</strong>, EA still came out on top in 2025, with <strong>Skate</strong> coming in as the most downloaded free-to-play title. Not that those downloads translated to engagement compared to other big free-to-play titles, since it ranked <strong>17th</strong> among the top PC and console games by monthly active users (MAUs).</p>



<p>While EA dominated the new AAA space, the other thing worth noting is the fact that the AA, remastered, and older AAA games that are priced anywhere between <strong>$30</strong> and <strong>$60</strong> made up the majority of Sensor Tower's entries in its dot graph of the best-selling games. Among those are notable 2025 releases like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-the-29th-annual-dice-awards-taking-home-game-of-the-year-yet-again/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</strong></p>

			<p>Global data firm <strong><a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a></strong> has released its <strong>State of Gaming 2026</strong> report, which looks back at the video game industry in 2025 across a wide range of metrics, including where publishers are spending their marketing money and which publishers have the most downloaded portfolios. Last year, <strong>Microsoft</strong> was the publisher that spent the most on marketing for its PC and console games, but it came <strong>second</strong> in terms of cross-platform game downloads for its portfolio of titles, behind <strong>Electronic Arts (EA)</strong> in first, while <strong>Take-Two</strong> came in third.</p>



<p>At least that's how it shakes up when you're not including the mobile industry. The number of downloads across PC and console markets, data which Sensor Tower pulls from <strong>Steam, PlayStation,</strong> and <strong>Xbox</strong>, is, as you might expect, far smaller than the scale of what's happening in mobile. If you include the mobile downloads, it's <strong>Tencent</strong> that stands above the rest. </p>



<p>The only reason the graph below shows <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/denis-dyack-defends-ue5-decries-state-of-the-industry/">Embracer Group</a></strong> at the top is that the data used for the graph does not include data from <strong>Supercell</strong> or <strong>Miniclip.com</strong>. Without those numbers, Tencent sits in fifth place with its PC, console, and mobile downloads combined.</p>



<p>EA was the number one publisher in terms of PC and console game downloads with <strong>206M</strong>, followed by Microsoft in second place with <strong>148M</strong> and Take-Two in third with <strong>92.8M</strong>. The rest of the PC/Console top five is rounded out by <strong>Ubisoft</strong> at <strong>80.1M</strong> and <strong>Sony Interactive Entertainment</strong> at <strong>73.9M</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-450.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Sensor Tower</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for where the rest of the top five PC and console publishers stand in their ad spend, Take-Two sits behind Microsoft in second, EA is in third, <strong>Epic Games</strong> is in fourth, and Tencent is in fifth. Ubisoft, <strong>Nintendo</strong>, and Sony take the next three spots, respectively, with the top ten getting rounded out by <strong>Roblox</strong> and <strong>Wargaming.net</strong>, in that order.</p>



<p>Even with Epic Games coming in fourth for overall ad spend, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> takes the top spot for the most money spent on ads for a single game. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a></strong>, the only game on the list from EA's portfolio, and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/top-3-best-selling-aaa-pc-console-games-all-ea-games-battlefield-6-ea-fc-25-ea-fc-26/">best-selling game of 2025</a></strong>, had the fourth biggest marketing spend to take top spot on the sales charts.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/page-55.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Sensor Tower</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, was spending most of its ad budget on <strong>Minecraft</strong>, though it also spent a fair chunk of change on <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong>. Interestingly, <strong>1047 Games</strong> spent enough money trying to market <a href="https://wccftech.com/1047-games-makes-one-final-bid-splitgate-arena-reloaded-battle-royale-arena-royale/"><strong>Splitgate</strong> </a>that it made the top ten list for PC and console games with the most ad spend in <strong>ninth place</strong>. The peak concurrent player count on Steam for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</a></strong>, the game that started out as Splitgate 2 and gained its 'Arena Reloaded' subtitle <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/"><strong>following a relaunch</strong></a>, remains at just under <strong>26K</strong>.</p>



<p>A clear example of how you can't just throw marketing money at a game to get it back on its feet, with its numbers more regularly sitting around and under <strong>1K</strong>. Not that Steam is the whole picture, of course.</p>



<p>With all of these portfolio downloads and marketing spend, the games that actually kept players engaged in terms of monthly active users (MAUs), the top five of that list is about what you would expect, especially considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">top five most-played games on PS and Xbox in the US alone for 2025 (and 2024)</a>. <strong>Counter-Strike</strong> is the only wrinkle, bumping Roblox out of the top five.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/page-53.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Sensor Tower</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>EA is also the only publisher to have more than three games in its portfolio on this list, between Battlefield 6, <strong>EA Sports FC 25</strong>, <strong>Apex Legends</strong>, and <strong>Skate</strong>. The next publishers up are Microsoft with Minecraft, Call of Duty, and <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> and Take-Two with <strong>Grand Theft Auto V, NBA 2K25,</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>. Epic Games and <strong>Valve</strong> have two each, while every other game is that publisher's sole inclusion.</p>

			<p><strong>Amazon</strong>'s divestment from gaming investments continues today with the news that the company has canceled its publishing deal with <strong>Maverick Games</strong>. This decision follows the shutdown of Amazon's MMO divisions that were working on <strong>New World</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> game</a>, as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/king-of-meat-shut-down-april-2026-amazon-glowmade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week's shutdown of <strong>King of Meat</strong></a> (and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent departure of division chief <strong>Christoph Hartmann</strong></a>). Essentially, Amazon's current gaming investments are just the upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> games from <strong>Crystal Dynamics</strong> and the cloud-based platform <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-luna-re-launch-later-this-year-prime-subs-library-cloud-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna</a></strong>.</p>



<p>A spokesperson <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Game Business</a>:</p>



<p><em>As part of our strategic evolution to focus on projects that leverage Amazon’s unique strengths and scale, including the recent re-launch of Luna and our Tomb Raider franchise partnership with Crystal Dynamics, we have decided to release Maverick Games from their publishing agreement with Amazon Game Studios.</em></p>



<p><em>We have tremendous respect for the Maverick Games team and the compelling narrative-led driving experience they’re creating. This decision allows Maverick Games the flexibility to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing their game to market. We’re proud of what we accomplished together during our partnership and wish them every success in the future.</em></p>



<p>Maverick Games <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-former-developers-announce-new-aaa-studio-maverick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was founded in early 2023 by former Forza Horizon developers</a></strong>. The studio is still working on an open world driving game targeting a release on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S and X. Today, they released a statement to thank Amazon for the opportunity and to <strong>reassure fans that they're committed to the project and are currently in talks with other partners to replace Amazon in the publishing role</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NACON Files for Insolvency Just Days Before Its NACON Connect Showcase]]></title>

            <guid>1445773</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><span>This morning, French publisher&nbsp;<strong>NACON</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed for insolvency</a>, following a major issue with its majority shareholder, </span><strong><span>Bigben Interac</span>tive</strong>. On November 24, 2025, Bigben announced <strong>it had secured a refinancing agreement with a banking pool of leading French banks for €43 million</strong>, repayable over 6 years. This would have partially refinanced prior outstanding bonds, leaving a non-refinanced residual balance of approximately €16.1 million to be repaid separately on the maturity date. </p>



<p>However, on February 13, 2026, just four business days before the maturity date, t<strong>he banking pool informed Bigben that it was refusing to honor the drawdown notice sent in connection with the refinancing</strong>, claiming it could invoke a breach by Bigben for an obligation to provide information stipulated in the credit contract. <strong>Bigben strongly disputed this legal analysis and reserved all its rights</strong>. The refusal was described as both unexpected and late, leaving Bigben (and, therefore, Nacon) with almost no time to find an alternative.</p>



<p>Unable to proceed with the partial repayment of the aforementioned €43 million, last week Bigben announced <strong>the temporary suspension of trading</strong> in its shares on Euronext Paris and its bonds on Euronext Access Paris. NACON, as a subsidiary, had its own shares suspended simultaneously.</p>



<p>Today, the two companies filed different court procedures reflecting their different situations. Bigben filed for an amicable conciliation procedure, stressing it would have no impact on operations, employees, or customers. Bigben also noted that its principal asset is its majority stake in NACON, <strong>in which it holds 56.72% of the share capital and 65.79% of the voting rights</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>NACON's situation appears to be more severe</strong>, though. Unable to meet its own liabilities as a direct consequence of the parent company's crisis, it filed for full judicial reorganisation proceedings. This freezes existing liabilities for an observation period of up to 18 months while the company attempts to develop a continuation plan. Essentially, NACON has formally acknowledged that it cannot meet its current liabilities. The procedure gives it court protection while it attempts to restructure, but the outcome is, at this point, genuinely uncertain. If no viable continuation plan emerges within the observation period, <strong>liquidation becomes a very real possibility</strong>.</p>



<p>It's all a bit surreal for fans of NACON's games, even more so because the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-connect-returns-next-week-edge-of-memories-the-mound-cthulhu-cosmic-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just announced</a> this Monday that <strong>a new NACON Connect Showcase will go live on March 4, 2026</strong>, providing updated news and footage on upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-memories-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-visions-of-mana-but-in-a-good-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edge of Memories</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-gameplay-nacon-ace-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-february-2026-edition-jumping-into-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a></strong>.</p>



<p>As a reminder, NACON currently owns the following 16 AA development studios that altogether employ more than a thousand developers:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nacon Studio Milan</li>



<li>Big Ant Studios</li>



<li>Daedalic Entertainment</li>



<li>Cyanide</li>



<li>Midgar Studio</li>



<li>RaceWard Studio</li>



<li>Neopica</li>



<li>Ishtar Games</li>



<li>Crea-ture Studios</li>



<li>Eko Software</li>



<li>Kylotonn</li>



<li>Spiders</li>
</ul>
