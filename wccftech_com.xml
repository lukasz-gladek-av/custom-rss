			<p>Aside from <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing the new sales milestone of <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong></a>, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> also just revealed the final launch date of the <strong>Gothic remake</strong>. The game will need a little more polishing time, the group said, and is now set to ship globally <strong>on June 5, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>As you might recall, a public demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-in-the-works-maybe-meanwhile-heres-a-playable-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released six years ago</a> as a test to gauge interest in the remake. The reception was positive, despite some criticism of certain aspects of the demo, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>led the Embracer Group to found Alkimia Interactive</strong></a>, which has been working on the Gothic remake ever since.</p>



<p>More than a simple HD "Remaster Plus", <strong>this should be considered a complete reimagining</strong>. The studio recently shared several stories from the development trenches in a "Making Of" series. For example, they faced a fundamental challenge from the start: determining which elements should remain unchanged and which needed expansion or modernization. The original Gothic's strengths, such as immersive open-world design, memorable characters, and systemic interactions, had to coexist with solutions to plot holes, inconsistencies, and unfinished content. To help with that, <strong>Alkimia hired Mattias Filler, a writer from the original Gothic games</strong>, to provide an authentic perspective and tackle those longstanding issues.</p>



<p>Here's an overview of how the folks at Alkimia overhauled the original Gothic in each of the game's main areas:</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="art-new-content">Art Direction and New Content</h2>



<p>Early in development, the team <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alkimia-interactive-delves-into-its-approach-to-art-in-the-gothic-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided against creating an HD version of the original's art style</a></strong>, instead pursuing believable, realistic visuals, albeit with a dark fantasy edge. The art direction also<strong> draws heavily from Baroque painting across multiple eras</strong>. References cited by Alkimia include <strong>Caravaggio's chiaroscuro</strong>, Spanish tenebrism of Velázquez, the landscape work of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, Flemish Baroque color contrasts from David Teniers the Younger, and Hubert Robert's atmospheric ruins. The team also incorporated influences from the nocturnal scenes of Romantic painter Petrus van Schendel.</p>



<p>The Gothic remake <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes approximately 20-25% new side quest content</a></strong> while expanding original quests with additional options and solutions. Previously empty or underutilized locations received new content, dungeons have been made more interesting, and hidden paths to Gomez's castle offer alternative entry points. <strong>Cut content from the original game is being restored and reimagined where appropriate</strong>.</p>



<p>The writing <strong>maintains Gothic's signature rough, conversational tone</strong>. It's dialogue written the way people actually talk in pub discussions or pen-and-paper RPG sessions, rather than formal medieval speech. The English localization received particular attention because previous versions failed to capture the iconic tone of the German, Polish, and Russian translations.</p>



<p><strong>The narrative has also grown significantly</strong>, with the team working to fix the aforementioned plot holes, improve pacing in later chapters, and give more depth to storylines that felt rushed in the original. <strong>One major expansion involves Orc culture and player interaction with it</strong>. Where the original treated Orcs primarily as enemies to kill after brief story interactions with Ur-Shak and Tarrok, the remake explores their role more deeply, recognizing that the Orc War is the entire reason the prison colony and magical barrier exist in the first place.</p>



<p>The team even <strong>developed a complete Orcish language for the game</strong>, designed to sound harsh and aggressive with trilled "Rs," "ch," and "tz" sounds. The language's grammar was inspired by East Asian languages such as Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese, keeping words short (one to three syllables) and avoiding articles, grammatical gender, tense markers, and plurals.</p>



<h2 id="simulation-systems">Simulation Systems</h2>



<p><strong>Major story moments now trigger visible changes in the world</strong>, including altered environments and updated NPC routines that reflect the narrative shifts. This addresses one of the original game's problems, where monumental events had very little impact on daily life. Alkimia also said that the Gothic remake <strong>addresses the original's diminishing player freedom in later chapters</strong>. The developers have strived to ensure that multiple paths and choices remain available throughout the game, rather than funneling into a linear conclusion, which would be quite contrary to the game's overall design goals.</p>



<p>The game <strong>employs a full-world daily routine simulation that runs constantly</strong>, even when the player isn't nearby. When approaching NPCs (non-playable characters), <strong>they spawn exactly where they would be based on their schedules</strong>, so players can now encounter templars traveling between the Sect Camp and Old Mine, something impossible in the original.</p>



<p>NPCs also <strong>react systemically to player actions, witnessing crimes, responding to trespassing, and interacting with thrown objects</strong>. New dynamic events include Baal Parvez preaching in the Old Camp to recruit for the Swamp Camp, with nearby diggers stopping their tasks to listen. Characters carry objects, react to weather, and discuss recent events and rumors among themselves.</p>



<h2 id="gameplay-evolution">Gameplay Evolution</h2>



<p>The armor system in the Gothic remake moves away from fixed guild armor sets to a customizable upgrade path. <strong>Players can improve camp-specific armor with different visual elements and defensive properties</strong>, for example adding wolf fur for arrow defense or mobility enhancements while maintaining the aesthetic of their chosen faction.</p>



<p>New abilities expand exploration possibilities beyond the original. <strong>Climbing functions similarly to The Legend of Zelda</strong>, but is limited to specific areas. <strong>Diving is now a proper skill that improves with practice</strong>, allowing players to interact with underwater objects, pick up loot, and explore extensive submerged areas.</p>



<p>The developers emphasized the game's difficulty, <strong>encouraging players to consume items through challenging encounters rather than hoarding resources</strong>. Combat remains unforgiving like in the original, and players can still attempt "silly things" like fighting powerful enemies from the start, staying true to Gothic's philosophy of not holding the player's hand.</p>



<p><strong>Exploration emphasizes the feeling of being lost</strong>, especially at night when darkness becomes oppressive even with torches and light spells. The conversation camera system uses preset shots with environmental checks to avoid clipping through walls or characters, with fully planned cinematography for important scenes.</p>



<p><strong>The Gothic remake implements a dynamic trading system in which merchants passively trade items among themselves</strong>, converting goods into ore to maintain market liquidity. This prevents the player from becoming the central bank and controls material abundance. The studio's economic designer analyzed the original game's patterns to understand its intended progression, identifying where the economy broke down in later chapters. The goal was to delay economic collapse until chapter six through active management, though complete stability is impossible in a closed economy with the player as the only active agent. <strong>Crafting recipes will evolve with player investment</strong>, and the act of crafting itself provides value by converting excess materials into ore while reducing inventory clutter.</p>



<p>The dynamic weather system includes <strong>varying sun intensity and color, cloud cover, rain with fluctuating intensity, storm probabilities, growing waves during storms, lightning illuminating the night sky, and lingering post-storm fog</strong>. The music system uses layers and cues that change based on in-game events rather than a single master track, ensuring players don't tire of the soundtrack during extended play sessions. The composer approached each scene as painting pictures, assigning instruments to visual elements and experimenting with melodies and harmonies to convey specific emotions.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the whole Making Of series is the claim that they've consciously created an art style and systems <strong>"not just for one game, but for an entire new series within the Gothic franchise"</strong>. It definitely sounds like they'd like it to serve as a foundation for future entries beyond this remake, although of course, the necessary requirement will be the successful release of the first one. </p>



<p>It won't be long until we can find out for ourselves. Stay tuned.</p>

            <guid>1433275</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, during the <strong>Embracer Group</strong>'s <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q3-october-december-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-528-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q3 FY 2025/26 report</a> (October-December 2025), it was revealed that <strong>Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong> game has sold <strong>more than five million units</strong> <strong>in its first year on the market</strong>.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II originally debuted on <strong>February 4, 2025</strong>, so it's been roughly a year and eight days since its release. The historical first-person open world action roleplaying game enjoyed an excellent reception; on Wccftech, reviewer Chris Wray <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awarded it a rare perfect score</a></strong> and waxed plenty of praise upon the latest work of the Czech studio:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>



<p>The game also <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to beat Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> in the Best RPG category of the Wccftech Awards '25</strong>, with our staff and readers aligning on this view.</p>



<p>Throughout the year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <strong>was updated with free patches and three premium DLCs</strong>, the last of which, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mysteria Ecclesiae</a></strong>, did particularly well, helping the game perform <strong>"well ahead" of the Embracer Group's expectations</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the financial report, the <strong>Dead Island</strong> and <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> IPs also performed better than estimates in the quarter. Even so, net sales <strong>decreased by 26%</strong> year-over-year, and organic growth <strong>also decreased by 8%</strong>. This decline was primarily driven by negative foreign exchange effects and the divestment of Easybrain within the Mobile segment. </p>



<p>Still, Embracer Group CEO <strong>Phil Rogers</strong> stressed that the company is going in the right direction: focusing on its core IPs (Tomb Raider, Dead Island, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and, of course, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-needs-to-be-turned-into-one-of-gamings-biggest-franchises-says-embracer-coo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings</a></strong>) while targeting a reduction in both opex and capex and completing its consolidation goals (they recently <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold Arc Games and Cryptic Studios</a></strong>). Let's just hope this doesn't mean new layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> hosted its final spotlight announcement in its <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">flurry of spotlight showcases</a> over the past two weeks with the <strong><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243862/catch-up-on-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight?_gl=1*1cph9zv*_gcl_au*MzgxMDg5NjM0LjE3NzAyMzQyMjQ.*_ga*MTM2NDczNzMwMi4xNzY4MjM1Nzgw*_ga_VYKNV7C0S3*czE3NzA4NzAyMDgkbzUkZzEkdDE3NzA4NzEyNzYkajU2JGwwJGgw">Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight</a></strong>, a peek into everything coming to the <strong>Diablo</strong> franchise in the coming milestone year. Like previous spotlights for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-dropping-the-2-overwatch-2-is-now-just-called-overwatch-moving-forward/">Overwatch,</a></strong> and <strong>Hearthstone</strong>, plenty was left off today's agenda to be revealed at <strong>BlizzCon 2026</strong>. But we now know of one major element that's coming to <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, <strong>Diablo Immortal</strong>, and <strong>Diablo II: Resurrected</strong>: <strong>Warlocks.</strong></p>



<p>The Warlock class is being added to all three aforementioned titles, the most significant of which perhaps is its inclusion in Diablo II: Resurrected, since this is the first new playable class Diablo II has gotten in <strong>25 years</strong>. Each game is getting its own version of a Warlock class, though the only version that's currently playable right now, is the one in Diablo II: Resurrected. That update was shadow-dropped as part of today's spotlight, which you can check out in full below.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>It was a tight <strong>39 minutes</strong> of news and reveals for the long-running action RPG franchise, capped off with Diablo IV game director <strong>Brent Gibson</strong> teasing that players will <em>"freak</em>" when they reveal more of what's coming at BlizzCon 2026, though the video comically cuts before he spoils the surprise.</p>



<p>As for what is coming to the franchise, starting with Diablo II: Resurrected, which saw its Warlock go live today, this remaster of one of the most beloved action-RPG titles ever doesn't just get a new class for the first time in over two decades. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Diablo II: Resurrected | Warlock Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vKwWWzC5iQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That change is why Blizzard will still keep the vanilla, sans-Warlock version of Diablo II: Resurrected available for those who want it. That means when you boot up Diablo II: Resurrected, you'll be given the option of jumping into the game that Blizzard released in 2021, or <strong>Diablo II: Reign of the Warlock</strong>.</p>



<p>Reign of the Warlock is a new paid expansion for Diablo II: Resurrected, which will cost you <strong>$25</strong> if you want to check out the first new class to arrive in Diablo II for 25 years. At least several of the updates mentioned in the spotlight today aren't behind a paywall, with the main draw being the new class.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Diablo IV | Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3HIeWxW2sJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Players can also enjoy updated terror zones, the introduction of <strong>Colossal Ancients</strong>, new quality-of-life updates like new loot filters and updated stash tabs, the introduction of The Chronicle to keep better track of your loot, and new items and runewords.</p>



<p>Diablo Immortal players will have the wait the longest to get their hands on the Warlock class, as it's not scheduled to arrive until sometime in <strong>June 2026.</strong> For now, the studio did reveal a roadmap for the full year, with new quests, gear, bosses, new endgame PvE challenges, zone events, subzones, and more, all set to arrive before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Lastly, Diablo IV players also have some waiting to do to learn more about the Warlock they'll be getting to play as when the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred-expansion-release-date/">Lord of Hatred</a></strong> expansion arrives on <strong>April 28, 2026.</strong> Blizzard will host another spotlight event on <strong>March 5, 2026,</strong> which will be digging into the Warlock class, showcasing its strength and abilities in action.</p>



<p>The new expansion will also include a reignited endgame experience with the introduction of <strong>War Plans</strong>, which lets you decide what kind of endgame you want. You'll be able to create a playlist of activities based on what you want to do, choosing from six endgame modes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Pit</li>



<li>Infernal Hordes</li>



<li>Heltides</li>



<li>Nightmare Dungeons</li>



<li>Lair Bosses</li>



<li>Kurast Undercity</li>
</ul>



<p>Depending on what rewards you hope to return with and what kind of experience you want, you'll curate your endgame between five of those options, earning progression points in a unique endgame skill tree. Diablo IV will also get a new "<em>hyper-rare</em>" endurance event, <strong>Echoing Hatred</strong>, which bombards you with enemy waves until you die, earning more and better loot the longer you can survive.</p>

            <guid>1433191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's happened again. <strong>Highguard</strong>, the latest free-to-play live service first-person shooter to enter the fray, this time from developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment,</strong> a team made up of former <strong>Apex Legends</strong> and <strong>Titanfall 2</strong> developers, launched just two weeks ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/">January 26, 2026.</a></strong> Today, <strong>February 11, 2026,</strong> a little more than two weeks since launch, the studio confirmed it had a round of <strong>layoffs.</strong></p>



<p>Individual developers across multiple branches, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427501095955914752/?ref=aftermath.site">principal</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427500304054693890/?ref=aftermath.site">senior</a> members of staff, shared the news on their LinkedIn accounts before the studio made a statement of its own on the official Wildlight Entertainment X (formerly Twitter) account.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game</em>," the studio's statement begins. "<em>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful for our players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be part of our community</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful…</p></div>— Wildlight Entertainment (@WildlightEnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Though Wildlight doesn't provide an exact figure, at least two of the developers who shared they had been impacted described it as "<em><strong>most</strong></em><strong>"<em> </em></strong>of the team getting cut, with all of their statements really driving home the tragedy of the situation.</p>



<p>"<em>Today I was laid off from my job at Wildlight along with most of the staff</em>," writes lead tech artist, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427497173774225409/?ref=aftermath.site">Josh Sobel</a></strong>. "<em>It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before. I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ years for anything. <strong>I'm still spinning</strong>, and I won't be in a place to start thinking about the future for a while, but please keep me in mind if, in the near future, you're looking for a senior or higher level rigger</em>."</p>



<p>It's clear that Highguard did not land how Wildlight wanted it to. The studio leadership's decision to slot it into <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> with a trailer that, unfortunately, did not properly convey what the game is to players, followed by complete silence, into an attempt at making it a shadow-dropped hit left players with nothing but confusion going into it and a skeptical approach when servers were turned on.</p>



<p>Once the game was live and a few of the game's more glaring cracks were shown, those who tuned in at launch dropped it like a lead balloon. The studio's leaders <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">apologized for how the launch was handled</a> while players on Steam were relentless, showering Highguard with negative reviews.</p>



<p>To the studio's credit, it acted quickly to try and address player feedback, <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412">adding a 5v5 mode</a> to ratchet up the intensity as players complained about boring matches, but that hasn't turned things around fast enough for Wildlight's leadership and bean counters. The only thing that has changed about Highguard in an instant is the size of the team working on it, which ultimately only makes it more difficult for the studio to try and put a better foot forward than what they brought to launch.</p>



<p>Sobel isn't the only one who describes their team or their time at Wildlight with such high praise, and it all makes you wonder why this keeps happening. Why studios are spun up and formed in a way that is continually deemed to be unsustainable without serious cuts to the only thing of real value a new studio has: its team.</p>



<p>It's not impossible for Wildlight to turn things around. We've seen studios do it before. But it is now beyond tiring to still see studios invest so much effort, time, and money in games where everything rests on the hope that it'll be the next <strong>Fortnite</strong>, and if it doesn't hit that mark right away, cut to plan B of laying off as many people as possible and hope you can become the next <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-remnant-update-adds-gravity-manipulation/">No Man's Sky</a></strong>.</p>
