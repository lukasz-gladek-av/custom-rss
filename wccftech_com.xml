			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Nintendo</a> doesn't respond to every rumor and bit of speculation on the internet, but it has stepped up to push back against speculation that AI-generated images were used in <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Some viewers of Nintendo's last Treehouse presentation for the kart racer suspected that AI-generated images were used in Mario Kart World on the billboards that fill part of the background on the tracks. Specifically, they thought artwork of a bridge and one immediately next to it of a skyscraper being built were AI-generated. A third billboard featuring a car with exaggerated windows was also thought to be AI-generated.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World – Grand Prix Gameplay – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWjkbAQOGY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-suggestion-that-ai-generated-images-used-in-mario-kart-world">Eurogamer</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson bluntly shut down the suspicions that AI-generated content was used in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"<em>AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World</em>," they said.</p>
<p>The images in question might look wonky to players now, but it's worth noting that Nintendo is likely updating and polishing details like these background billboards as much as possible, leading up to the release of the game and the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p>
<p>These billboards could have even been placeholders at the time of the Treehouse presentation that will be swapped with entirely different images for the game's launch, or simply not final versions of the artwork that will feature in the final release. Ultimately, at this stage in the game, we can't determine if these images were AI-generated. It'll be interesting to see if they make it into the final release, and if they remain the same, are updated and polished up, or are changed entirely.</p>
<p>Of course, the simplest explanation here could also be the truth, that these images simply aren't up to snuff, and that these background billboards perhaps aren't where Nintendo's artists have done their best work. People make mistakes all the time, and this could very well be as simple as that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alkimia Interactive has announced that an updated version of the Gothic Remake demo is now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3448280/Gothic_1_Remake__Demo_Nyras_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The demo wasn't very well-received when it first became available during February's Steam Next Fest, but the developers have improved it based on the community's feedback. For example, Alkimia was originally inspired by the slow movement of a game like Red Dead Redemption 2, but players communicated that they'd prefer something more reactive.</p>
<p><em>We see a lot of things we didn't have so much on the radar, for example, like the movement in the game. Our main reference really was Red Dead Redemption 2, which is a game that has a very slow pacing in terms of movement. The clear feedback, though, was people like it more reactive, and that certain actions that are repeated over and over again should be rather quick, which means not realistic.</em></p>
<p><em>In the Demo specifically, there were certain elements that were not working out. The Demo is just what it is. It's not representative of the full Gothic Remake game. The Demo is locked at a certain time of day, so you obviously have just no visual variety. There’s no weather in there — it’s always sunny, right? You see one specific weather and daylight condition all the time. It's not doing justice to the full game.</em></p>
<p><em>Everybody has to realize also that, of course, the Gothic Remake demo has daily routines, but they are nowhere near as detailed as in the original. And of course it has some monsters, but like, of course you won't see how monsters beyond that react. You only see very few characters, and you don't see them in a camp, where they are actually living, where they have a real daily routine.</em></p>
<p><em>They are kind of like all in an extreme situation because they are trapped. You should get an idea of what can happen with progression, but it was maybe a little too fast. So players might get the wrong idea of like, oh, in the Gothic Remake you will actually progress faster than you will do. But no, the pacing is still very much the same, the power curve.</em></p>
<p><em>And then another big problem of the combat in the demo was the hit sounds. There were just clear bugs in there. Sometimes, you would think you'd land a hit with the sword, because the models touch each other, but it wouldn't recognize the hit, so it gives you this awkward feeling of like, oh, the combat system is bad.</em></p>
<p><em>But it's a glitch, it's a bug. It's something we'll address and fix. We're&nbsp;not saying like, hey, all is good, right? There's a lot of stuff we need to improve, much, much further and continue to work on until the very end.</em></p>

At Gamescom, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> with the developers and learned about some of the planned changes and additions (such as around ten hours of new content).</p>

			<p>Dune: Awakening's previously announced large-scale beta weekend is now live for players to jump in and try Dune: Awakening themselves, as Funcom continues to test its servers leading up to its new June 10, 2025, launch date.</p>
<p>Originally, Dune: Awakening was set to arrive in a little more than a week from the time of writing, on May 20. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/">At the ides of April</a>, Funcom announced that it had pushed the release date back three weeks, saying that the team needed "<em>a bit more time to cook</em>" in order to implement some changes and fixes it wanted to make based on feedback the team had received from players already in the closed beta.</p>
<p>Funcom has been beta testing Dune: Awakening for months now, with those lucky enough to get a beta invite being part of Funcom increasingly pushing the limit of its servers. But even with all the testing in the world, fans of the genre know that the biggest MMO's can still suffer from gameplay issues due to overcrowded servers.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, ahead of the beta test kicking off, Funcom <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/server-structure-and-large-scale-multiplayer-mechanics-explained">directly addressed</a> those concerns, telling players that "<em>this is not our first rodeo</em>," and that the team has expects, and has been preparing, for the "<em>heavy loads</em>" of players that'll hit its servers at launch.</p>
<p>The beta weekend will run from today, May 9, to Monday, May 12, and if you've yet to receive a beta invite from Funcom, you can still register for this weekend's beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">Steam page</a>. Funcom <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/large-scale-beta-weekend-all-you-need-to-know">adds</a> that if you wishlist the game and sign up to receive emails from the team about Dune: Awakening, that can increase your chances of getting a code. There will also be a Twitch broadcast hosted on May 10, 2025, from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom">Funcom's official channel</a>, where you'll have a chance to grab one of the "<em>tens of </em><em>thousands</em>" of codes that will be made available to those who tune in.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play up to the first 25 hours of Dune: Awakening in this weekend's beta, if you decide to do nothing else but play it the whole weekend, which Funcom says is most of Act 1. A key difference for this beta is that there's no NDA required to join. After playing as much as you like this weekend, you'll be able to talk about what you played and what you think. You'll also be able to stream the game, if you like, while playing.</p>
<p>If you want to find out a little more about what you'll play in this weekend's beta, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/">already spent a chunk of time with Dune: Awakening</a> playing the same content in this weekend's beta. Check out his thoughts on it in the preview.</p>
