			<p>Peter Connelly, who Tomb Raider fans will recognize as the original composer and sound designer for the series, is now serving 16 months in jail, beginning yesterday, July 17, 2025, for "<em>fraudulently obtaining</em>" a $50,000 (£37,500) loan from the UK government during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Published on the UK government's official website through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud">Insolvency Service</a>, and spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-composer-jailed-for-16-months-after-being-found-guilty-of-fraud">Eurogamer</a>, Connelly was found to have received two loans for his business when businesses were only allowed to receive one. The first was a legitimate loan at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 for £22,000, or $29,500 USD. The second was a month later, for £37,500, or $50,000 USD. Connelly "<em>deliberately inflated</em>" the turnover his company faced in order to secure a larger loan, said David Snasdell, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service.</p>



<p>Connelly claimed that the turnover his company endured amounted to £150,000, though in reality it was a little over £58,000. When being interviewed regarding the loan, he told the Insolvency Service that he "<em>had been given the opportunity to re-imagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack</em>," a project he told them would be very lucrative and significant. He claimed to have taken measures like selling his car to pay for the work, though he later claimed the project had stalled. In August 2021, his company went into liquidation, with neither of the loans he'd taken out having been paid back.</p>



<p>Connelly will be paying back the loans over the course of several payments that will continue while he serves his jail time, and he's also been banned from being the director of a company for the next six years. </p>



<p>"<em>Peter Connelly blatantly disregarded the rules of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, designed to support small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic</em>," Snasdell said. "<em>Connelly not only secured two loans when businesses were only allowed one, but deliberately inflated his company's turnover to receive more money than he was entitled to</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>Connelly isn't the first notable member of the video game industry to be found guilty of financial crimes. Yuji Naka, the co-creator of Sonic, whose last major release was Balan Wonderworld, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-naka-arrested-again-over-insider-trading-relating-to-final-fantasy-vii-the-first-soldier/">was arrested and given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading</a>.</p>

			<p>Saber Interactive, the studio currently working on the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake, Jurassic Park Survival, and a currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">unannounced title based on a Hasbro franchise</a>, to name a few, is teasing the reveal of what appears to be another game, and fans believe it to be a Hellraiser-based horror game.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Saber posted a teaser video and a<a href="https://www.july-22-2025.com/"> URL</a> that points to next Tuesday, July 22, 2025, 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST.  Going to the website doesn't show you much, as it is just the date and time for the reveal, appearing as old VHS footage. The teaser posted to YouTube tells us a bit more, with a soundscape that views on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1m2mi55/hellraiser_game_in_development/">Reddit</a> and in the comments of the video believe point to this project potentially being a new Hellraiser game. </p>

<p>Today, Saber posted another video, this time of horror-focused influencers being shown what is presumably the same trailer that we'll all get to see this coming Tuesday. Their reactions describe it as an extremely gore-y game, with one even commenting, "<em>Can you even put stuff like that in a video game?</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We'll see what Tuesday has in store, but the notion of a Hellraiser game is an interesting one. Pinhead, the iconic character from the series, was added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-update-skill-base-matchmaking/">Dead by Daylight</a> in 2021 and was removed from the game <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-pinhead-why-leaving">earlier this year</a> without a completely clear explanation. As far as dedicated Hellraiser games go, there was a Hellraiser game in development in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2354075/">1990 for the NES, set to arrive in 1991</a>, but it never made it to store shelves.</p>



<p>It could be the case that Pinhead was removed from Dead by Daylight to make way for whatever Saber Interactive has planned for Pinhead and the Hellraiser franchise. Or, Saber is teasing something entirely different, and we've all misread the signs to be Hellraiser ones. We'll find out on Tuesday.</p>
