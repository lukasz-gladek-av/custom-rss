			<p>Yesterday, SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. is coming to all the main consoles (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2) following <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-available-on-steam-new-launch-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut on PC on January 28</a>.</p>
<p>The news was shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivwjAPp-w6Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during Virtua Fighter Direct 2025 Spring</a> by legacy Virtua Fighter project producer Seiji Aoki, who stated:</p>
<p><em>I know we’ve kept you waiting, but our Steam release Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. is finally coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. Since Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.'s launch, we’ve heard your requests for multiplatform support via the official Virtua Fighter Discord and other channels. We on the development team want to give users on all platforms the opportunity to enjoy Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., so we are happy to bring you this announcement.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Also, in bringing this title to multiple platforms, we’re planning to include cross-play support. And to make your cross-play experience even smoother, the rollback functionality used in the Steam version will be supported on all platforms. We’re going to include even more content to make this much more than a simple port, which we’ll tell you about in future updates.</em></p>

<p>During the dedicated live stream, the developers also provided an update on the New Virtua Fighter Project. Wolf Hawkfield, a returning character, will be featured in the upcoming new franchise installment. As part of the announcement, it was also explained that each character's motivations behind their decision to join the fighting tournament would be made much clearer to players this time around. Producer Riichiro Yamada said:</p>
<p><em>In previous Virtua Fighter games, the backstories and motivations of the characters weren't well known. This is one of the major differences between the previous games and our new game. Playing the new game will give you a much better sense of who the characters are, including their backstories and personalities.</em></p>
<p><em>This includes characters from the previous games, too. Legacy characters have been refined for the modern age but remain authentic at their core. </em><em>Wolf's motivation this time is his love for wrestling. What's happened to Wolf since the last game? Why does he fight?</em></p>

<p>The new Project does not currently have a release window, but we'll keep you updated on any rumors and news about it.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier this week, Epic Games founder, president, and largest shareholder Tim Sweeney was featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive interview with Lex Fridman</a>. The highlight of the conversation was the unexpected mention of Unreal Engine 6 progress, but in the four-hour-long chat, Tim Sweeney also addressed some of the feedback on the Epic Games Launcher, which is often criticized in comparison to Valve's Steam client. Sweeney admitted to the launcher's faults, but also stressed that Valve has had a lot more time to mature its platform.</p>
<p><em>I think one of the reasons that people characterize the Epic Games launcher as clunky is because the Epic Games launcher is clunky and we need to improve this. There's a lot of work going on there and, you know, I wish we'd gotten better at addressing quality of life features and prioritize them above all of the other features.</em></p>
<p><em>Steam has 15 years of built-up work by many of the best programmers in the whole industry working on that. It's a much larger team working on Steam and a lot more time working on it, so we've had to make a lot of prioritization decisions about what do we support with the Epic Game Store and when.</em></p>
<p><em>A lot of the time, it's been supporting commercial features like merchandising, offering multiple versions of a game for sale, and offering upgrades from the regular edition to the deluxe edition and other things that partners work.</em></p>
<p><em>Other priorities have been quality of life and launcher load times and other things. And we've not put enough emphasis on the quality of life features.&nbsp; We've recognized this very clearly multiple times, and we've gone through multiple refactorings. But that's definitely been a disappointment to us and to a lot of users. One thing it took us a while to realize was it's not in uniform.</em></p>
<p><em>Depending on your proximity to a CDN and the size of your game collection, it can be either awesome or really clunky. And the users for whom it's really clunky are the people behind a large part of the complaints. I should also say that the Steam launcher, for a long time, from my memory, but also just looking online, was also very clunky in the beginning.</em></p>
<p>While Sweeney has a point, it should be clarified that the Epic Games Launcher can no longer be considered at its beginning, having launched in December 2018. There's still a lot of room for improvement on the client, that's for sure.</p>
