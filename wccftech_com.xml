<p>As a side note, NVIDIA leveled its Miami and Warsaw, Poland SuperPODs to RTX 5080 hardware, with  Portland and Ashburn coming next. Two more PC games have also been enabled to take advantage of the increased computational power of the new RTX 5080 servers:</p>

<p>The GeForce NOW RTX Blackwell upgrade started rolling out last month. You can read my impressions <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>:</p>



<p><em>NVIDIA's GeForce NOW was already by far the best cloud gaming experience available, and the RTX 5080 server upgrade, coupled with various other improvements, only increases the distance between the platform and its competitors. There is absolutely no question that, if you want to play games on the cloud, this is the way. The visual quality is now a near-match for the local experience, but the responsiveness is not. L4S adoption may help a little, but I suspect the physics limitations will remain a mostly unavoidable hurdle for the foreseeable future.</em></p>

			<p>A Kingdom Come Deliverance remaster or upgraded version is rumored to be in the works for an early 2026 release, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bertik11/">bertik11</a>, who shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1nuoprk/warhorse_studio_upcoming_upgrade_and_fantasy_game/">Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a> that the first entry in the series by Warhorse Studios will get an upgrade early next year, between January and April. The user added that the studio is not working on a new Lord of the Rings game as rumored, but is still working on their own fantasy game.</p>



<p>While a rumor coming from an unspecified source should be taken with a massive grain of salt, bertik11 proved reliable regarding Kingdom Come Deliverance series rumors. Last year, the user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1erxl3d/kingdom_come_deliverance_2_is_coming_in_2025/">revealed that Kingdom Come Deliverance II would be delayed to 2025</a> before the official announcement was made and that the game's Gamescom booth would have a medieval village design, which turned out to be the case, so there's a good chance they indeed have access to insider information.</p>



<p>Although Kingdom Come Deliverance was a solid role-playing game when it launched back in 2018, a remaster would improve the experience considerably if it addressed some of its most critical issues. Quality-of-life improvements, in particular, would make it a much more accessible game, improving its steep learning curve and interface to make it easier for those who only played its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">excellent sequel</a> to get into the game and experience the beginning of Henry of Skalitz's story for themselves.</p>

			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn recently released native Steam Deck build delivers significant performance improvements over the original Proton Windows build, according to a new comparison video.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a>, the new build of the survival-horror game developed by Bloober Team runs much better than the original Proton Windows build in nearly every comparison.</p>



<p>While hitting a steady 60 FPS is something the Steam Deck obviously can't do, even with a native build, the performance improvement it brings makes the game often run above 30 FPS, even in demanding areas like the Apartment Complex, where the system struggles to even hit 30 FPS with the Proton Windows build.</p>

<iframe title="Cronos The New Dawn: NEW Steam Deck Native Build Performance Vs Proton Windows Version" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2k1FFgbBofc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While any game benefits greatly from a 60 frames per second framerate and higher, with its slower-paced survival-horror experience, Cronos: The New Dawn is more than enjoyable even at 30 FPS, as it relies mostly on atmosphere to deliver one of the finest games released by Bloober Team. You can learn more about it by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">checking out my review.</a></p>



<p>The release of native Steam Deck builds is a relatively recent happening, but one that is extremely welcome to extend the life of the system which essentially started the PC handheld craze of the past couple of years. <span>Besides the Cronos: The New Dawn build, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">B</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/" target="_blank">aldur's Gate 3 native Steam Deck build is also now available for download</a>, introducing performance improvements in the city of Baldur's Gate in Act 3, one of the most demanding areas in the game.</span></p>
