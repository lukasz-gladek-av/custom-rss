			<p>English voice recording for Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 may have already begun, judging from a recent social media post.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/english-voice-recording-for-final-fantasy-vii-part-3-likely-underway.1172094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Cody Christian, who plays Cloud Strife in the Remake trilogy, recently shared an Instagram story with a caption that suggests the voice actor is recording lines for the character. Considering the story was confirmed to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">complete</a>d a few months back, it's not unlikely the script has also been finalized, thus allowing the voice recordings to begin.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, except that its development started before Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched last year on PlayStation 5. As already mentioned, it was confirmed a few months back that the plot for the game is complete, and the concept powering the final part of the trilogy is crucial. One of the features that will set the upcoming finale apart from its predecessor is the ability to explore the world with the Highwind airship, a feature the development team is fully committed to delivering without compromises. Hopefully, this means that even the regions that already appeared in Rebirth will receive some shakeup to make it interesting to revisit them.</p>
<p>While Final Fantasy VII Remake fans who own a PlayStation 5 had the chance to experience the second entry in the series last year, PC players were given the opportunity to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth only this year. The wait, however, was worth it, also thanks to modders who are introducing features not available in the vanilla game, such as additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters.</a></p>

			<p>Ever since we learned via rumors and leaks that Oblivion was returning, it was unclear whether it would be a remaster or remake. The initial wording found in Bethesda's internal documents <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial mentioned a remaster, but then we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found out</a> that Bethesda had enlisted another developer (Virtuos, the same one that's doing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater) to port the game to Unreal Engine 5 and make several improvements to areas such as combat, leveling, user interface,</p>
<p>Indeed, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and launch</a> earlier this week, many were surprised at the amount of work that had been done. One of them was original The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Design Director Bruce Nesmith, who became Lead Designer of Skyrim and also worked on Starfield before leaving Bethesda in September 2021 to pursue a career as a book author. <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/original-elder-scrolls-oblivion-designer-was-floored-by-new-release-im-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/?callback=in&amp;code=ZTGYZMU0ZTETM2I4NS0ZOGU3LTGXMJETMZIXY2IZOGFINWMX&amp;state=e74208805f8a402a906dbd7c2f353923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Videogamer</a>, he said this is closer to 'Oblivion 2.0' than a mere remaster:</p>
<p><em>I spent a lot of years working on that game. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into it, along with everybody else on the team. And I intimately knew every single scene that they were showing. And they looked amazing.</em></p>
<p><em>I was assuming this was going to be a texture update. I didn’t really think it was going to be the complete overhaul that they’ve announced it to be… I would not have batted an eye at that. But to completely redo the animations, the animation system, put in the Unreal Engine, change the leveling system, change the user interface. I mean, that’s, you’re touching every part of the game. That’s a staggering amount of remastering. It almost needs its own word, quite frankly. I’m not sure 'remaster' actually does it justice. The closest that could come to categorizing it is Oblivion 2.0.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the new game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily moddable</a>. While its graphics run on Unreal Engine 5, the game logic is still powered by the original engine, so several original mods are being ported right now. This could pave the way to many further improvements from the already thriving modding community. There are already 270 mods on Nexus, and it's just the beginning.</p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-blade-runner-game-canceled-supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, Guildford-based game developer Supermassive Games recently canceled an unannounced game based on the Blade Runner IP.</p>
<p>The game was allegedly titled Blade Runner: Time To Live. It would have been a "character-driven, cinematic, action-adventure game" set in 2065. The plan was to make a "compelling story that blends the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay," with an expected length between 10 and 12 hours.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live started pre-production in September 2024 and was being worked on by the team that made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Quarry</a>. Pre-production was supposed to be completed in March 2025, while prototyping was scheduled to end around six months later.</p>
<p>The game's release was tentatively planned for September 2027 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Interestingly, the report also mentions a potential launch on next-generation PlayStation and Xbox platforms. However, it's hard to imagine that Supermassive would already know so much about Sony's and Microsoft's plans that they would be aware of whether the new consoles will be available then.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live was projected to have a budget of approximately $45 million, with $9 million set aside for external performance capture and acting talent. Original music production, image rights, usage fees for actors, QA and game testing, localization, and any future DLCs would have to be budgeted separately.</p>
<p>The game would feature a replicant known as So-Lange as the playable character. It would start in New Zurich, with So-Lange tasked to 'retire' a dangerous leader of an underground replicant network called Rev. However, So-Lange would soon be betrayed and left for dead in a hostile environment. In terms of game mechanics, the report says it would have been possible to upgrade skills and abilities.</p>
<p>The reasons behind the early cancellation weren't detailed, although it is said that Blade Runner IP owner Alcon was to blame. Of course, this is just one side of a story that may never fully come to light. It's a shame, though, as Supermassive definitely has the chops to make an interesting adventure game set in this universe.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since there was any game set in this seemingly ripe setting. Thankfully, there's still Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, in development at Annapurna Interactive since 2022.</p>
