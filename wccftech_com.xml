			<p>NVIDIA announced a GeForce NOW promotion: the Day Pass at the Performance tier is currently discounted by 40%. The exact pricing is going to vary depending on your country, but in the US, it brings the price down to $2.39. Day Passes were <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-granblue-fantasy-relink-day-passes-and-cloud-g-sync-nvidia-reflex-support-for-60-120-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> in March 2024 as a way to allow prospective customers to check GeForce NOW without committing to a longer subscription.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Performance tier replaced the previous Priority tier. It gives users access to a GeForce RTX-capable rig that can enable ray tracing and DLSS Super Resolution in supported games.</p>
<p>Two of the PC games that you can check out on GeForce NOW right now are Dune Awakening and Frosthaven. The former is Funcom's massive survival sandbox game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> earlier this week, while Frosthaven is the spiritual sequel to Gloomhaven. It's a dark fantasy tactical RPG developed by Snapshot Games, the studio founded by X-COM creator Julian Gollop, formerly responsible for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/phoenix-point-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phoenix Point</a>. There's a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3608380/Frosthaven_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> now for Steam Next Fest and you can experience it for a limited time via the GeForce NOW cloud. In the demo, players can choose from four different characters and play through four quests, which are just a small part of the Frosthaven experience. You can play alone or with up to three friends in multiplayer mode, and select a difficulty level that suits your desired level of challenge and that of your team.</p>
