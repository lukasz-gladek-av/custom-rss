			<p>One mechanic that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> uses to keep players engaged in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> is the game's <strong>Expeditions</strong>, which are essentially a big reset for your Raider. Things like your Workshop, player level, skill points, blueprints, coins, quests, and stash upgrade progress all get reset, letting you start again with new rewards and buffs to make your next round of Topside visits all the more intriguing.</p>



<p>What makes Expeditions interesting to complete (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-dominance-continues-reportedly-stands-as-top-selling-game-across-steam-xbox-and-playstation-for-third-consecutive-month/">and what helps keep players logging onto ARC Raiders each day</a>) is that you have a limited amount of time to prepare for them, with Expeditions running on a tight, 60-day schedule, as you prepare the necessary resources to embark on one. Players will be able to head out on the game's first Expedition since it launched on <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> with the deadline to sign up for it being <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of that, and ahead of the game's second Expedition, Embark has introduced a couple of changes to get players better prepared for the endeavour. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARCRaiders_Expeditions-Infographic.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first major change comes directly from player feedback. After hearing from players that the required Stash value for the maximum amount of rewards was too high, Embark has decided to lower it. The required value for maximum rewards is now <strong>3 million coins</strong> <strong>(600K per skill point)</strong>. Players will still get five skill points for reaching the 3 million Stash value mark.</p>



<p>The second major change is the introduction of a new <strong>catch-up mechanic</strong> meant specifically for Raiders who were not able to obtain enough coins during the first Expedition period. This mechanic lets Raiders reclaim the skill points they missed, with catch-up skill points being heavily discounted. "<em>Amass the entire Stash value and enjoy your skill points before everyone else, fail to do so and the catch-up system will allow you to close the gap over time</em>," <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">a blog post on the game's official website reads</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For this Expedition, you will need to gather 300K Stash value per skill point missing from the first Expedition. When departing, coins will contribute to the skill points of the second Expedition, before contributing to missing skill points from the first one</em>."</p>



<p>If you're participating in the Expedition for the first time with the start of the second Expedition next month, then you'll also be able to get the rewards from the first Expedition. The rewards for the second Expediton are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Evolved Patchwork outfit (permanent)</li>



<li>Scrappy cosmetics (permanent)</li>



<li>Expedition Indicator Icon (permanent)</li>



<li>24 Stash Spaces (permanent) </li>



<li>+0-5 skill points (permanent) </li>



<li>5-10% XP boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>6-12% Scrappy materials boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>60-70% repair value increase (consecutive)</li>
</ul>

			<p>Today, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published some updates</a> on the <strong>Xbox schedule for this year</strong>. In 2026, the Xbox brand <strong>celebrates its 25th anniversary</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft</strong> is trying to launch games in four of its biggest franchises: <strong>Forza Horizon</strong>, <strong>Halo</strong>, <strong>Gears</strong>, and <strong>Fable</strong>.</p>



<p>We already know the date of <strong>Playground's Forza Horizon 6</strong>, which will be released on <strong>May 19, 2026</strong>, as announced during the recent <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong>. Warren adds that his sources indicate <strong>Halo Studios</strong> (formerly known as<strong> 343 Industries</strong>) is targeting a Summer release for <strong>Halo Campaign Evolved</strong>, the single-player remake of the 2001 game that launched the first-person shooter series and originally captured the interest of many gamers in the Xbox brand.</p>



<p>Fable is targeting Fall, as Playground officially shared, and <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, the prequel featuring fan-favorite characters <strong>Marcus Fenix</strong> and <strong>Dominic Santiago</strong>, is also aiming to debut in the latter half of the year. In both cases, Warren added that <strong>Microsoft is very mindful of keeping apart from Rockstar's juggernaut, Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, which is set to crash on the market with all its weight on November 19. <span>Another GTA VI delay is still not out of the realm of possibility, but&nbsp;<strong>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/more-grand-theft-auto-vi-marketing-beats-coming-in-summer-2026-while-gta-v-has-sold-over-225m-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has confirmed earlier this week that the marketing campaign will begin in the Summer</a>, so both Rockstar and Take-Two are honed in to ensure the game isn't delayed a third time.</span> As such, Microsoft will try to release both games as early as possible before November 19. After would be more complicated, as December isn't traditionally a great time to release games.</p>



<p>According to Warren's sources, Xbox is also preparing to launch <strong>Double Fine</strong>'s new multiplayer game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/double-fine-productions-kiln-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiln</a></strong> in April, as well as new <strong>Starfield</strong> content (and PS5 release) "soon". On that note, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prepare-your-spaceships-starfield-is-reportedly-landing-on-playstation-5-in-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Polish website has just come out to share that the game will launch on PlayStation 5 <strong>on April 7</strong></a>, though that remains a rumor for now.</p>



<p><strong>Bethesda's Fallout 3 remaster</strong> is reportedly still in <strong>"active development"</strong> to ensure that it is as polished as possible. Warren doesn't share any date in his report, but it sounds like he doesn't expect the game to be released this year. However, he reckons <strong>Xbox fans will get a new controller this year</strong>. These are supposed to be next-generation controllers (although it's unclear whether they will add haptic feedback or adaptive triggers-like tech, inspired by the PS5's DualSense), with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity to reduce latency in <strong>Xbox Cloud Gaming</strong>. On that note, The Verge's journalist adds that <strong>Microsoft is "close" to testing free ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming with Xbox Insiders</strong> ahead of a wider rollout later in 2026.</p>



<p>What do you make of these Xbox plans? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, as part of a flurry of showcases <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">announced to start 2026,</a> the studio hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/"><strong>World of Warcraft: State of Azeroth</strong> showcase</a>, which dug into the roadmap the company has for the long-running MMORPG in 2026. Following that showcase, in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/five-things-i-learned-from-my-world">The Game Business</a>, game director <strong>Ion Hazzikostas</strong> and executive producer and vice president <strong>Holly Longdale</strong> went further into what they envision for the future of World of Warcraft, and the <strong>"<em>bigger vision</em>"</strong> they have for the franchise.</p>



<p>It's clear that Blizzard has a lot coming for World of Warcraft. The game's next major expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">is due to arrive on <strong>March 2, 2026</strong></a>, with several major additions coming to the game in the expansion. It'll be the game's eleventh expansion since it launched in 2004 and completely changed the landscape of the video game industry forever. Even after all those years of massive success, over 20 years later, Blizzard is looking to the future for Warcraft's best days.</p>



<p>"<em>We firmly believe <strong>that our best years are ahead of us</strong>,</em>" said game director Ion Hazzikostas. "<em>It's game design, but it's also social design, and it's thinking about how we meet a new generation where they are. That's going to mean thinking outside the box in some places compared to what our game has traditionally been. But <strong>we're excited to keep taking big swings</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>That could also potentially include new games within the Warcraft universe that aren't an MMORPG. With <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/">BlizzCon 2026</a></strong> arriving in September, and Blizzard promising it'll be "<em>one for the ages</em>," we could really start to see the Warcraft IP branch out. A new <strong>RTS</strong> is one possible avenue, but the reality is, with how expansive the Warcraft universe is, Blizzard could really take the franchise in any direction it feels fits within the world, and offers something new to its audience.</p>



<p>The drive for Blizzard to expand and do more with Warcraft comes in part from the fact that the game is now, in 2026, <strong>22 years old</strong>. It's old enough to drink in the US, and that means there are people who started playing it in their early to middle age who lived a whole life and are now retired, still choosing to spend their time in Azeroth. At the same time, there are young people getting into the game for the first time today, and Blizzard has to find a way to satisfy the game's whole audience.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We've got a lot of players that say to us, 'Give me something I can play with my kids, or play with my partner,'"</em> added Holly Longdale. "<em>We have so many players and the ability to really dig into how they play, it's given us a lot of interesting opportunities to be able to broaden </em>out.<em> We are <strong>aiming to be a game that's approachable for anyone</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Breadth is really the key</em>," continued Hazzikostas. "<em>It's less about change in the sense of moving away from something and becoming something different, and more about being broader and more approachable in our offerings and meeting people where they are</em>.<em> We already do have retired folks playing World of Warcraft, and a generation of young students who may have all the time in the world. 20 years ago, there was a sense that, for a lot of people, the game might be something that appealed to them, but they don't have the time for it, because it might be all-consuming</em>.<em> That is not what we are anymore. It's not what we've been for a long time. But we still have that depth for those who want it. If you only have 20 minutes to play, you can accomplish something. But if you have an entire weekend or a vacation, and you want to go deep, that's there as well.</em>"</p>



<p>How that breadth of experiences materializes is something we'll see as Blizzard continues to update and work on the game going forward. Though we know that, at least for now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/">that won't include a console version of Warcraft</a>, bringing the game to other platforms and making it playable in new ways is definitely one avenue Blizzard might explore.</p>



<p>It's World of Warcraft: Classic offering is one avenue it's already deep into, as Hazzikostas explains that there's an entirely different audience of players who go for Classic, over the modern World of Warcraft. "<em>Classic players are completely different, for the most part, than modern players. They behave differently. They want different things. We don't have a whole lot of crossover between both games</em>."</p>



<p>Wherever Blizzard takes World of Warcraft, it's clear that Blizzard sees more for the game, with Longdale going so far as to say that it's currently an "<em>underutilized</em>" IP.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s a fantastic IP. In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized, and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible. And that means <strong>evolving what Warcraft means, what it is, and where it’s going</strong>. We want it to be approachable</em>," Longdale said. </p>



<p>"<em>And at the same time, we want to take advantage of 20 years of stories that have been told and not told, and start bringing it out to the world in a broader way. That’s my goal and vision</em>. <em>We’re never going to stop doing the things people love</em>. <em>But at the same time, <strong>we have a bigger vision than simply being an MMORPG</strong></em>."</p>
