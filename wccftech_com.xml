            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The multiplayer beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-october/">now live in its early access period</a> for users who've pre-ordered the game and Xbox Game Pass subscribers. It'll be live for anyone who wants to check out the beta, not included in those two categories, on October 5, but even before it opens to the general public, reports have surfaced across social media that cheaters are running amuck through the game.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-is-out-and-is-already-plagued-by-cheaters">Eurogamer</a>, after a bunch of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/ca/en/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">talk from Treyarch and Activision about its new and improved anti-cheat</a>, which even goaded cheaters on by saying, "<em>Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear</em>," cheaters have taken up the challenge Activison put to them.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In fairness, the above clip comes from an account that<a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1973874240253489434"> Treyarch has already found and banned</a>, so the team is indeed doing its best to get rid of cheaters as they appear, but this doesn't say very much about the preventative measures, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">adding the same Secure Boot protections that Battlefield 6 has</a>, in Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Is it enough for Treyarch to ban these accounts after they've already gotten in-game and ruined a match or two? On one level, yes, as long as cheaters are being caught, then you could argue that's the anti-cheat protections working well. That said, the players who have their matches ruined by cheaters who are only caught after the fact might not feel that way.</p>



<p>As long as there are people playing multiplayer games, there will be those who will cheat, and it's a constant battle for developers to minimize the impact of cheaters as much as possible. But it's worth asking what these kernel-level measures are for if they're not even prepared for the opening hours of an annual beta test. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Along with Microsoft and Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">hiking the price of Xbox Game Pass up by 50%</a>, the three tiers of Game Pass also changed, adding new features for each tier. But it also seems like some features were removed, namely the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers would get on add-ons for Call of Duty, including COD Points.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279">CharlieINTEL on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, prior to the price change, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription got you discounts on games included in Game Pass, and in the case of Call of Duty, subscribers also a 10% discount on Call of Duty cosmetic add-ons and COD Points. Not anymore though.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox has removed the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members could get on add-on content for Call of Duty - including removing the discount on Call of Duty Points and BlackCell as part of the changes to Game Pass this week. <a href="https://t.co/ipaMgENuwi">pic.twitter.com/ipaMgENuwi</a></p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's the latest example of Microsoft sending a clear message that playing games on Xbox and using Xbox services, including Game Pass, are no longer for people trying to save money on their annual gaming spend.</p>



<p>Removing a 10% discount is the kind of squeezing that, after a price hike for Game Pass, which followed a price hike of the Xbox Series consoles in the US (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">the second console price hike this year</a>), will only work to drive a bigger and bigger wedge between Xbox and its players. It's the kind of thing that leads people who have been with the Xbox platform since the beginning <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-xbox-generation-will-be-remembered-for-one-thing-greed">to write features lambasting the greed Microsoft has shown</a>.</p>



<p>Pretty much everything coming out of Xbox lately has told players they will have to pay a premium to play games on Xbox. It's no wonder that after the console price hikes, Microsoft removing the ability for players to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">redeem Microsoft Points towards Game Pass subs</a>, and of course, the price hike of Game Pass itself, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">players swarmed to Microsoft's website to cancel their Game Pass subscriptions</a>.</p>



<p>Actual living essentials are already increasing and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">encouraging people to spend less on non-essential areas of their lives, like videogames</a>. The decision to leave Xbox and its services behind is made even easier when Microsoft is simultaneously raising prices and removing discounts.  </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-tracing-took-6-months-to-implement-in-doom-the-dark-ages-id-software-dev-thinks-the-tech-will-spread-further.1315639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, DOOM: The Dark Ages became the sixth PC game (not counting RTX remakes like those made for Quake II and Portal) to support real-time path tracing after Cyberpunk 2077, DESORDRE, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. </p>



<p>id Software's latest entry in the DOOM franchise did not support the technology at launch. Still, a month later, on June 18, 2025, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-pc-performance-slaying-demons-never-looked-better-nvidia-dlss-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released an update introducing path tracing and NVIDIA's DLSS Ray Reconstruction</a>. Both features significantly improved the game's visual quality and made it, alongside its excellent performance, a benchmark against which developers must compare their work.</p>



<p>This week, NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-id-software-used-neural-rendering-and-path-tracing-in-doom-the-dark-ages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a Q&amp;A with id Software's Director of Engine Technology</a>, Billy Khan, to discuss the studio's implementation of path tracing. According to Khan, it took the Texas-based studio around six months to implement the technology in their game. The programmer also shared the belief that more games will make the leap from ray tracing to path tracing in the coming years.  </p>



<p><em>Path tracing is now part of id Tech 8. We’ll continue research and development in this area. As with all technology, we evaluate its use on a per-game basis to ensure it meets the needs of the game and delivers value to players. I believe path tracing will continue to evolve and will be used in more games in the coming years. </em></p>



<p>Of course, game developers' adoption will likely accelerate if, as rumored, future AMD graphics cards <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-details-how-next-gen-udna-gpus-could-boost-ray-tracing-with-dense-geometry-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are going to offer significant ray tracing optimizations</a>. Meanwhile, Khan mentioned NVIDIA's Opacity Micro-Maps and Shader Execution Reordering, the latter specifically, as highly helpful for optimization in DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>



<p><em>For high-performance, visually complex scenes, optimizing both surface shading and transparency is crucial. Techniques that allow the GPU to intelligently reorder shading work and skip unnecessary calculations—like on pixels fully occluded by alpha-tested geometry—yield significant speedups. Both NVIDIA Opacity Micro-Map (OMM) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER) have been extremely useful for optimizing surface shading on the GPU. Some of our biggest optimizations for path tracing resulted from utilizing shader execution reordering.</em></p>



<p>Lastly, Khan noted that DLSS RR really helped surface all the amazing details enabled by path tracing.</p>



<p><em>DLSS Ray Reconstruction added much-needed fidelity to denoising our path-traced results while preserving more detail. It’s a strong improvement in performance and quality over traditional denoising techniques. I’m excited to see further innovation here, which will empower more devices to play games with higher visual fidelity.</em></p>



<p>Did you play DOOM: The Dark Ages (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our game review is here</a>, by the way) with path tracing on? If so, what was your impression of id Software's implementation? </p>
