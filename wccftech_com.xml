			<p>Liquid Swords, a Swedish developer founded in 2020 by ex Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg, has unveiled their debut game, Samson: A Tyndalston Story, during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase.</p>



<p>About a year ago, the studio had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> the photorealistic visuals of its Unreal Engine 5 open world game. Now, we have received a lot more details. According to the developer, it's going to be a gritty, brutal story.</p>



<p>The protagonist, Samson McCray, is forced to return to the unforgiving streets of the titular city of Tyndalston. He owes some very, very dangerous people a lot of money, and to make sure he returns to pay his debt, these criminals are threatening Samson's sister.</p>



<p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story is based on the simple, yet brutal truth that time is against the protagonist. With every passing day, the debt owed grows with interest. Each job picked by the main character uses up a limited supply of Action Points, and every decision affects how the city treats him, with no do-overs possible. Samson must keep moving forward because standing still makes everything worse.</p>



<p>While one of the features listed is indeed 'open world districts', this is not the type of near-endless open world game where you can stop to explore every nook and cranny without any repercussions. It's a focused story, likely not even too long given that the recommended price is $24.99. Over the course of the narrative, players will learn what broke Samson's family and what it takes to fix it before time runs out.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>That said, Liquid Swords has prepared several systems that will cause Tyndalston to react to what Samson is doing. The police, for example, will push back if the protagonist sows too much chaos on the streets. Moreover, faces, factions, and streets shift in response to Samson's actions.</p>



<p>As you can see in the trailer, fights look very grounded. On-foot combat appears to be focused on brawling, with Samson using momentum, terrain, and improvised tools to take them down. But there's also car combat, with high-speed chases easily turning into collisions, traps, and close-quarters destruction.</p>



<p>The developers also confirmed that Samson: A Tyndalston Story includes a skill tree with over 25 upgrades to shape the main character into the type of fighter preferred by the player.</p>



<p>The game will launch on PC (no other platforms have been confirmed at this time) via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/samson-ab5af7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. It shouldn't be far off, either, with Liquid Swords promising an early 2026 release. </p>



<p>The Epic Games Store already lists the minimum and recommended requirements, although they are oddly missing the CPU:</p>
