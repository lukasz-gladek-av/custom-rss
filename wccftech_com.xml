			<p>From April 1, those with a PlayStation Plus subscription will get access to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-april-robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April's monthly games</a>, which include RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory, all of which are very different games and provide a decent amount of variety.</p>
<p>First, you have RoboCop: Rogue City, where you are part man and part machine and bring justice to Old Detroit, a city riddled with all manners of crime. You have to complete objectives by finding evidence, interrogating suspects, and making sure that public order is maintained on a day-to-day basis. However, it's a bit more high stakes than that, as your choices can determine the fate of the citizens involved. The iconic original RoboCop Actor, Peter Weller, reprises his role for this title.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of horror, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will be one for you. This is a third-person, asymmetrical horror game which is based on the revolutionary horror movie from 1974. In this game, you play as a victim where you have to try and stay stealthy while staying out of the Family's reach. You'll have to find tools that will help you survive. Alternatively, you can play as the Slaughter Family, and track down the guests to try and stop them from escaping.</p>
<p>Another very contrasting title in the PlayStation Plus catalog is Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory. In this game, you play Keisuke Amazawa, where you dive into the Digital World to try and prove your innocence after being accused of committing a crime. To do this, you join a group of hackers and join them to solve troubles that are threatening the universe. In this game, you'll get to uncover the backstory to the events that take place in Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth. If you like catching and battling with Digimon, there are over 320 Digimon to discover.</p>
<p>All three of these games will be available to PlayStation Plus members on April 1 and will be available until May 5, when the next games will be announced.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this is the last chance to download <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-be-available-via-ps-plus-in-march/">March's games</a>. They will disappear on March 31. For those who missed it, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection are all currently available for PlayStation Plus members.</p>
<p>These games will stay in your library and will remain playable as long as you have an active PlayStation Plus subscription.</p>
