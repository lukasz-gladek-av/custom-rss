			<p>According to Japanese analysts, the Nintendo Switch 2 will remain scarcely available in global stores until at least next Spring. As <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-Switch-2-likely-to-remain-scarce-until-next-spring-analysts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by Nikkei, Toyo Securities senior analyst Hideki Yasuda and UBS Securities analyst Zhai Yijia estimate that the console's first-month sales following the June 6 launch might be around 6 million units.</p>



<p>Yasuda reckons that, even with the limited supply, the Nintendo Switch 2 could reach 20 million units sold by the end of this fiscal year (March 2026), while Yijia is a bit more conservative with his 18 million units. Regardless, these goals would outperform the original Switch by 20% to 30%.</p>



<p>Yiija is also more conservative in his long-term outlook on the console's sales:</p>



<p><em>Initial sales are higher than those of the Switch and Sony's PlayStation 5, but this should not be seen simply as an increase in demand. Those consoles suffered from semiconductor shortages at the time of their release that limited production, curtailing supply. It will be difficult to surpass the cumulative sales of the Switch.</em></p>



<p>His colleague Yasuda is more optimistic:</p>



<p><em>It is overwhelmingly popular compared to past game consoles, and consoles that have a strong initial response tend to continue to have high demand.</em></p>



<p>Market analysis firm DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell over 100 million units by the end of 2029, which would definitely keep it on track to surpass the original console over time.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has commented on the Switch 2 price, with President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stating</a> that the company is evaluating the extent to which the pricing may be a barrier for certain consumers, especially the younger ones:</p>



<p><em>We believe the pricing of Nintendo Switch 2 is appropriate for the gaming experience it offers,<br>and what is most important is to provide entertaining experiences that demonstrate the value to<br>consumers. To achieve this goal, we have incorporated various features into Nintendo Switch 2.<br>It is true that Nintendo Switch 2 has a higher price point than our past gaming systems. We are<br>creating various opportunities outside of our gaming systems for young children to engage with<br>Nintendo characters and game worlds, with one of the ultimate goals being that they will eventually<br>play on our gaming systems. We are closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system<br>might become a barrier.</em></p>
