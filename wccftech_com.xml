			<p>Players subscribed to the lowest, or 'Essential' tier of <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-and-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory-join-playstation-plus-april-lineup/">PlayStation Plus</a> can already grab the three free games for April 2025. Beginning on April 15, 2025, players subscribed to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers can collect their additional free games for the month.</p>
<p>As announced in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-april-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-the-second-episode-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>, six games are being added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers, and two classic titles, one from the original PlayStation and the other from the PS2, are being added to the PS Plus Premium classic games catalog.</p>
<p>The six games added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers and above include the 2023 commercial hit Hogwarts Legacy, a brand new puzzle game called Blue Prince, which is launching onto the service tomorrow, April 10. Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2, EA Sports PGA Tour, Battlefield 1, and Plate Up!.</p>
<p>The two classic titles are Alone in the Dark 2 from the original PlayStation and War of the Monsters from the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>Of all eight games in this lineup, Hogwarts Legacy is perhaps the most high-profile title, but arguably, the most prominent inclusion is the soon-to-release Blue Prince. Reviews for the new puzzle game from developer Dogubomb and publisher Raw Fury went live earlier this week, and so far, it has the highest score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">Metacritic</a> for any game released in 2025.</p>
<p>It's being touted as a new masterpiece, so if you like puzzle games and have a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscription, it might be worth checking out. Xbox players aren't being left out either since it'll also be available in Xbox Game Pass when it launches tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Earlier this month, The Molasses Flood (The Flame in the Flood, Drake Hollow, and the work-in-progress Project Sirius) was officially dissolved following its merger into CD Projekt RED. The Boston-based game development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired</a> on October 22, 2021, but the merger did not happen until April 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The Molasses Flood co-founder Daniel Isla, who has now departed from the studio for a new adventure, talked about this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315404560620044288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a>, where he also teased Project Sirius, which he described as an 'amazing' The Witcher multiplayer game.</p>
<p><em>To be ultra clear: this is a GOOD AND HEALTHY thing for the studio, and it was long-expected. It breaks down some organizational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org. Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka "the multiplayer Witcher game," of which I was the Design Director for three years). It's going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on.</em></p>
<p><em>On the sadder side -- not to bury the lede -- I've decided not to follow TMF on this transition. So last Monday -- the last day of TMF's legal existence! -- was also my last day at the studio.</em></p>
<p>We don't know a lot about this game, although a few job ads from a couple of years ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-stylized-action-pve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that it would feature stylized visuals, action combat, PvE content, and cooperative elements. Project Sirius was, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> in March 2023, when CD Projekt RED said it would formulate a new 'framework' for the project. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-finalizes-its-new-framework-some-work-seemingly-salvaged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that something might have been salvaged out of the previous work, so everything that Isla and his team have worked on could eventually come to fruition, although we have no idea when.</p>

			<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-last-of-us-renewed-season-3-hbo-1236364271/">Deadline</a> reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-hbo-series-multiple-season-things-to-be-flipped/">HBO's The Last of Us</a> has been renewed for season 3 just a few days ahead of the season 2 premiere this coming Sunday, April 13, 2025. The news doesn't come as a total shock, considering how often showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have talked about needing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/">least three, potentially four seasons</a>, to tell the whole story of The Last of Us Part II.</p>
<p>Realistically, we won't know how plausible a fourth season will be until we reach the end of season 2, and see how far along into the story of The Last of Us Part II this season takes us. But if a fourth season is needed, HBO sounds likely to grant it, with the executive vice president of HBO programming and head of HBO drama series and films, Francesca Orsi, expressing every confidence in Mazin, Druckmann, and the entire creative team behind the series.</p>
<p>"<em>It can't be overemphasized how proud HBO is for the outstanding achievement we believe the second season of The Last of Us is,</em>" Orsi said in a statement. "<em>Craig, Neil, Carolyn [Strauss] and the entire executive producer team, cast and crew have delivered a masterful follow-up and we're thrilled to carry the power of Craig and Neil's storytelling into what we know will be an equally moving and extraordinary third season."</em></p>
<p>In a separate statement, Druckmann expressed his gratitude to fans for their positive reaction and credited Mazin with playing a huge role in the adaptation's success.</p>
<p>"<em>To see The Last of Us brought to life so beautifully and faithfully has been a career highlight for me, and I am grateful for the fans' enthusiastic and overwhelming support. Much of that success is thanks to my partner in crime, Craig Mazin, our partnership with HBO, and our team at PlayStation Productions [...] We're thrilled to bring you more of The Last of Us!</em>"</p>
<p>For his own part, Mazin added that season 2 has "<em>exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew.</em>"</p>
<p>Just because we're getting a third season, though, doesn't mean a fourth will follow. Mazin previously said in an interview that he will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-will-flat-out-not-go-past-the-story-in-the-games/">"<em>flat out</em>"</a> not go beyond the plot of the games, and if that means only needing three seasons, then that's what it means. According to Mazin, only if a fourth season is needed will it happen.</p>
