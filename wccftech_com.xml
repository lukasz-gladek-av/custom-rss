			<p>There's been a lot of discussion on whether <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> would price <strong>GTA 6</strong> at the regular $70-$80 range of most triple-A games or become the first title to break the scary <strong>$100</strong> threshold.</p>



<p>The debate was <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally sparked</a> by Wedbush Securities analyst <strong>Michael Pachter</strong>, who predicted in August that the developer would make this bold choice and get away with it due to the game's massive hype. We at Wccftech quickly sought the opinion of another analyst, <strong>Rhys Elliot</strong> from Alinea Analytics, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countered</a> that it would be a bad idea as it would limit the barrier of entry to GTA 6 Online, which, if GTA 5 is any measure, will over time become Rockstar's main revenue driver. The most likely scenario would see Rockstar offering an optional, higher-priced edition, just like most triple-A publishers do nowadays, while keeping the base edition at its regular price.</p>



<p>Now, former Rockstar animator Mike York revealed a similar outlook in an interview <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Esports Insider</a>. </p>



<p><em>I don't think the price tag for GTA 6 will be $100. I think it will come out at $70, around the flatline of normal releases. I don't think Rockstar Games feel they need to release it at a higher cost. They'll sell so many copies of the game that they won't need to be greedy and charge $100. They don't need to leave that sour taste in people's mouths if they don't have to, so I don't think they'll do that.</em> <em>It might have a $99 day-one version if you pre-order it, where it gives you a huge bundle when GTA Online comes out. You have your own apartment or something like that. But the base game will be $70.</em></p>



<p>The other big question mark on the game pertains to its launch date. It has already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed twice</a>, after all, and fans are really worried there might be a third time. York, however, isn't concerned:</p>



<p><em>I think the game will be released in November 2026, as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games, then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually, companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time</em>.</p>



<p>GTA 6 is currently scheduled to launch on November 15, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p>In other Grand Theft Auto 6 news, we recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a>, thanks to an <strong>exclusive Wccftech interview</strong>, that the game's online mode might include features typically seen in MMORPGs. </p>

			<p>PlayStation and security: a match made in hell. Following the major PlayStation Network crash of 2011, which brought the network down for 23 days, users often encountered various issues, including account security concerns and <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-down/">prolonged downtime</a></strong><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/fbi-lizard-squad-investigated-ddos-attacks/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">, sometimes caused by DDoS attacks</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Judging from a new report, however, all these may pale in comparison to the possibility of an account being hacked, even with every security measure in place, including 2FA and passkey.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://x.com/LelloucheNico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Nicolas Lellouche</strong></a>, tech journalist at French publication Numerama, reported on X that their PlayStation Network account protected with a passkey has been hacked, as an unknown user was able to change the associated email and password, and even spend money from a linked payment method.</p>



<p>The story took a bizarre turn after Lellouche initially recovered the account through PlayStation Support, only for the hacker to seize control a second time. In an ironic twist, Lellouche spent the evening communicating with the hacker, who reportedly detailed how their method bypasses modern security measures.</p>



<figure><div>

<p>While Nicolas Lellouche has promised an in-depth follow-up to this story (which will be added to this post once it is live), he summarized what happened in a now-deleted message on X, which has been saved by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/french-tech-journalist-gets-their-psn-account-hacked-twice-in-a-row-while-having-passkey-and-2fa-and-exposes-a-security-breach-at-sony.1390756/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ResetERA forums member Arubedo</strong></a>.

This, if true, is likely the core of the issue, as knowing a public email address shouldn't normally constitute a security risk.</p>



<p>Ultimately, their account was targeted because a screenshot showing the email address associated with the account had been shared online in the past, and hackers are reportedly <em>"collecting screenshots of that type to take over accounts and making sure the owners never manage to get them back."</em></p>



<p>Without the follow-up report and a final confirmation of a potential massive issue, there's no way to know if all PlayStation Network accounts are genuinely at risk. For the time being, the basic security measures remain the best: avoid sharing personal information online and use prepaid cards whenever possible to make purchases on any digital store. Losing access to a digital library is bad, but having money stolen is considerably worse.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been just a little over seven years since <strong>Epic</strong> threw the gauntlet at <strong>Valve</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-taking-fight-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching its <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> as a direct competitor to the <strong>Steam</strong> platform</a> on PC. Right away, Epic tried to lure the game development community with a far more appealing revenue share split (88%-12% in favor of the developers, versus Steam's 70%-30%) and fans with a combination of exclusive games (which are more or less gone now, except for rare exceptions), free games and discounts (those <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are still very much happening</a>), and more.</p>



<p>At the end of 2025, we can safely say that Epic's massive efforts and expenses successfully carved a sizable user base for itself. Earlier this year, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the community had grown to host <strong>more than 295 million users</strong> in total. However, it did not impact Steam in the least; Valve's platform has continued to grow at an impressive pace, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing <strong>41.6 million concurrent users</strong> two months ago</a>. That's users who were online at the same time, a figure that can be verified independently thanks to the existence of SteamDB. The same cannot be done with the EGS, but it is believed to be far lower. </p>



<p>Besides mere figures, though, core gamers still tend to be quite dismissive of Epic's Store, whereas they are really fond and protective of Steam, perhaps at times even more than they ought to be. Why? This specific question was answered by <strong>The Astronauts</strong> founder <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong>. <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/epic-fails-to-compete-with-steam-because-egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-community-says-witchfire-lead-as-epic-has-nothing-to-do-but-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with FRVR</a>, he claimed that Valve's Steam feels more like a home thanks to its feature set, whereas the EGS is still merely a shop:</p>



<p><em>People are not, basically, using EGS as their home, it’s not home to them. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but EGS doesn’t have written reviews. They don’t have the forums. There’s nothing to do there but to buy. So that will always lose to a shop that is also emotional and you can basically engage with the shop.</em></p>



<p><em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community. There’s actually so much happening in that community hub for every single game, much more than I ever imagined, and it’s no wonder that people sort of get invested emotionally in Steam. And then they feel like, ‘Okay, my home is here, so my personal library is here’. So when something is released exclusively to Epic, something they want to play, then it’s a problem for them because now I’m gonna [have to] cheat on my home library with some other shop.</em></p>



<p>It's a fair explanation. While Epic has improved its store over time, introducing the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-opens-black-friday-cyber-monday-premium-editions-sale-now-with-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gifting feature for Black Friday 2025</a> and, a few days ago, a cross-platform text chat, it still lacks the community features mentioned by Chmielarz. Overall, Epic's improvements to its platform have been too slow to catch up with Steam, especially since Valve hasn't rested on its laurels and continues to refine its own ecosystem. </p>



<p>It should be noted that The Astronauts actually did take the timed Epic Games Store exclusivity deal for Witchfire, <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-qa-on-long-dev-phase-egs-exclusivity-dlss-3s-phenomenal-frame-rate-boost-and-fsr-xess-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as discussed in a previous exclusive interview with Wccftech</a>. The game eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched a year later on Steam</a>. In the FRVR interview, Chmielarz stated that the company was running out of money, making the deal vital to keep the company independent. Ultimately, he claims everyone got what they wanted: Epic got an exclusive game for a year, The Astronauts got the money to keep afloat, and the Steam community got a more polished game, albeit a bit later.</p>

			<p>You may or may not remember, back when Microsoft and Activision Blizzard King were trying to get the acquisition across the finish line, Microsoft signed deals with the two other major console platform makers to continue (<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or in one case, to start</a>) releasing Call of Duty games on that platform. Microsoft and Nintendo's deal was a 10-year commitment, and while no one really expected a Call of Duty game to come to the Nintendo Switch, it seemed like we could expect the shooter franchise to arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Well, we're two years into that 10-year commitment, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is no longer a poorly kept secret but the latest console on the market. So, where is Call of Duty on the Nintendo Switch 2? According to Jez Corden at Windows Central, it's just around the corner and into the new year.</p>



<p>Replying to a user on <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027">X (formerly Twitter)</a> regarding the series' arrival on Switch, Corden replied, "<em>The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Another user quoted the above reply from Corden, asking for further clarification, and if the arrival of Call of Duty on Switch could be counted as "<em>close</em>," to which Corden said, "<em>I wouldn't say close but it's on the way and hitting milestones, 2026.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wouldn't say close but it's on the way and hitting milestones, 2026</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003179459936145530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Now, Corden has been right in the past when it comes to rumours regarding Microsoft properties, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be cautious of his claim. We do at least know that Microsoft has to make good on its promise; the question of when and how is what is left in the balance. To be fair, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-bringing-call-of-duty-to-switch-will-require-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did say it would take some time</a> to get the technology ready for the port. </p>



<p>Still, we don't know if Activision would aim to put Call of Duty on the first-generation Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, which, if that is the case, would almost definitely limit the scope of the version Activision is trying to create for the hybrid handhelds. Perhaps in that scenario, it's Call of Duty: Warzone, not a mainline release, that arrives on the platform.</p>



<p>Or, perhaps Warzone hits both the Switch and Switch 2, while the latest mainline entry, Black Ops 7, arrives on the Switch 2 to take advantage of the extra hardware capabilities on the new device. Or, while Warzone makes it on to the Switch and Switch 2, the next mainline Call of Duty game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2027-introduce-new-sub-series-says-leaker/">not the new sub-series said to be coming in 2027</a>, but whatever 2026's Call of Duty will be), is the one to arrive on Switch 2.</p>



<p>Or none of that, with Nintendo and Activision taking what is arguably the weirdest route, but one that would harken back to the days when games for handheld consoles were made as somewhat changed, or sometimes entirely changed, experiences compared to their home-console contemporaries: a completely brand-new Call of Duty game that is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 and isn't just a port of the other Call of Duty titles.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, according to Corden, we won't have to speculate much longer.</p>
