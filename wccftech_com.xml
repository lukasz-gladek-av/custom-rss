			<p>For those who love a gacha game or like the idea of collecting outfits and customizing your character to look how you want them to, then Infinity Nikki is certainly a great game for that. Infinity Nikki has been taking the world by storm since its release, and version 1.2 is set to release very soon. This is the second major update for Infinity Nikki, the hit title by Infold Games. To celebrate the upcoming launch of the update, <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infold Games</a> has officially released a trailer to showcase the magic of Firework Season.</p>
<p>Version 1.2 will be available in Infinity Nikki on PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android on January 24, where you can step into the New Bloom Festival and travel to a brand-new location called the Firework Isles, which is a collection of islands with panoramic views, serene areas to take pictures in, a natural cave and Camp Kaboom. If you want to see what you can get up to in Infinity Nikki's upcoming update, make sure to check out the brand-new trailer below for glimpses into the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki Version 1.2 [Firework Season] Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VZjad44Bpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to these new locations, Nikki and Momo will be able to undertake a new storyline called Glowing Fireworks, which will take you to the Firework Isles to prepare for the Carnival of Fireworks. Of course, it doesn't all go to plan and there will be trouble along the way for Nikki and Momo to resolve together.</p>
<p>With this new update comes new outfits, with both free and paid options, as well as new mini-games to participate in and new activities to get stuck into. The main feature of this new Infinity Nikki update is the New Bloom Festival, which sees the Linlang Empire's traditions come to Florawish, where players will get to have fun with music, lanterns, and firecrackers for the festive season. This whole season will run from January 23 to February 25.</p>
<p>As a reward for participating in the season's events, players will be able to get their hands on rewards such as 20 free pulls, 3,500 diamonds, and two exclusive outfits. There will also be nine free outfits to get from the Heartfelt Gifts Store.</p>
<p>For a game that was released at the end of 2024, it has already done incredibly well, with the game being downloaded well over 20 million times and receiving critical acclaim across the globe. <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikkis-shooting-star-season-update-releases-december-30/">Continuous updates</a> are being released to make the game a smoother, more accessible experience.</p>
<p>Will you be playing the upcoming update for Infinity Nikki?</p>
