			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks stunning with <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/">path tracing</a>, but even the most powerful GPUs currently on the market cannot run the game at native 4K resolution and max setting at anything above 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Making some compromises in terms of settings and resolution, however, definitely looks worth it, as path tracing makes the game developed by MachineGames outright stunning, as highlighted in a comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TyrianYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyrian</a> on YouTube. The video also clearly shows how an RTX 4080 has trouble hitting 60 FPS during the introduction sequence at 4K resolution and with NVIDIA DLSS at the Balanced setting.</p>

<p>Much like the other games supporting path tracing like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle makes it pretty clear that it will be some time until it will be possible to run games with full path tracing at high native resolutions, as even an RTX 4090 cannot push past the 30 FPS mark at native 4K resolution and max settings, as shown in the test shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Mostly_Positive_Reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mostly Positive Reviews</a>. The most powerful GPU on the market struggles at native 1440p resolution as well, barely hitting the 50 FPS range in the most demanding of the two testing scenarios.</p>

<p>Besides looking incredible, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is also a great game to play.

			<p>It's been another weekend of records on Valve's Steam. Yesterday at 14:00 UTC, Steam itself broke a new concurrency record of 39.2 million users, over 12 million of whom were playing a game.&nbsp; Valve's platform continues to grow at an astonishing rate. In January, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-top-concurrent-player-number-record-nearing-34-million-connected-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 33.6 million users; the 34 million threshold was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-record-with-over-34-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> in early March and quickly surpassed by two new records (35 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-another-record-with-36-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 million</a>). The 37 million milestone was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-37-2-million-concurrent-players-breaking-all-previous-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> in August, while the following Steam <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 38 million concurrent online users. Of course, these new peaks usually happen whenever big games are released, driving users to engage with the platform. That was the case this past weekend with Grinding Gear's Path of Exile 2 and NetEase's Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>The action RPG sequel launched into early access this past Friday and it's doing amazing numbers for a premium game (this early access phase is paid, while the full launch will be free to play) with a Steam player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2694490/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> at 578K around fourteen hours ago. So far, user reviews are also quite positive (82%), aligning with <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco De Meo's early access preview on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em> The Early Access version made it clear how Grinding Gear Games has a very strong idea of how to evolve the formula of its predecessor to deliver an experience that is, undoubtedly, very fun at all skill levels. Considering how the game manages to be both extremely welcoming and extremely deep at the same time, I have no doubt that Path of Exile 2 will only get better from here on out, having the potential to become one of the best action role-playing games ever released.</em></p>
<p>The game is performing well on all platforms,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-redemptions-top-1-million-queues-over-the-weekend-are-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing</a></span>&nbsp;a million users in total. In fact, the developers were forced to enable temporary server queues.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals also had a strong launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering</a> a peak of 444K concurrent users on Steam during the week and then <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breaking</a> it with 480K users fourteen hours ago. However, the game has even more success on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X - <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to NetEase</a>, the team-based PvP superhero shooter has registered over 10 million players in the first three days. Of course, it has the advantage of being already free-to-play.</p>
