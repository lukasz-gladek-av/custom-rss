			<p>Crystal Dynamics will show off the new Tomb Raider game during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 event</a>, which airs on Thursday, December 11, at 7:30 PM Eastern Time / 4:30 PM Pacific Time / 12:30 AM British Time.</p>



<p>The confirmation just came from both Keighley and the official account of Lara Croft's franchise, which <a href="https://x.com/tombraider/status/1998102351358669148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Did you miss her? She missed you. As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to @thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises.</em></p>



<p>It's been a long wait for fans of the best-selling videogame heroine of all time, as certified recently by the Guinness World Records. Historic franchise developer Crystal Dynamics acted only as a support studio for the final entry in the reboot trilogy, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which was developed by sister studio Eidos Montréal and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-laras-coming-of-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in September 2018</a>. The studio was focusing on Marvel's Avengers at the time, which launched two years later and turned out to be a big flop despite the massive IP attached to the game.</p>



<p>In April 2022, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it was already working on a new Tomb Raider game and also revealed that it would move away from its proprietary Foundation Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Since then, we learned that Amazon Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would publish the game</a>. Amazon later purchased the movie and TV rights as well, and rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that they would like to create an interconnected universe across all these entertainment mediums.</p>



<p>As for details on the game itself, we have only a <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly dated rumor</a> (from May 2024) that mentions an Indian setting and an open world map that would allow Lara to roam with her motorcycle. </p>



<p>The TV series recently got Lara Croft's actress: <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>. The show will be filmed next year and is likely to launch at some point in 2027. However, gamers are certainly hoping to play the next Tomb Raider title in 2026, as it has been long enough already.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week ended with a bombshell report for the entertainment industry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/">with Netflix submitting a bid to purchase Warner Bros Discovery Streaming and Studios,</a> which includes HBO Max, HBO, and all of the film, television, and game development studios under Warner Bros for a whopping $82.7 billion. Now, Paramount Skydance has upped the ante with its own bid of $108.4 billion to try and steal the acquisition out from under Netflix's nose.</p>



<p>Of course, whether it'll be successful or not is a different story, but there are a few key differences between Paramount's offer and what Netflix had offered that make the whole ordeal quite interesting. One notable aspect is that, unlike Netflix, which just wants to acquire the Streaming and Studios branch of Warner Bros, Paramount wants the whole kit and caboodle.</p>



<p>Which is to say that Paramount would look to entirely acquire Warner Bros, including the Global Linear Networks branch as well as the Streaming and Studios branch. Paramount is also offering an all-cash deal, paying $30 per share instead of Netflix's offer to pay $27.5 per share. This is also a hostile takeover attempt from Paramount, which is why the company is taking it "<em>directly to shareholders</em>," as Ellison says, compared to Netflix's bid, which Warner Bros Discovery is already aligned with.</p>



<p>Paramount's press release even adds that it submitted six different proposals to Warner Bros Discovery over the course of 12 weeks, each of them privately rejected by Warner Bros executives, going so far as to say that Warner Bros "<em>never engaged meaningfully</em>" with Paramount's six attempts. Paramount is very clearly trying to win over shareholders, framing its proposal as the "<em>clearly superior</em>" one shareholders would not have seen if Paramount had not gone public with it.</p>



<p>"<em>WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company</em>," said David Ellison, chief executive officer and chairman of Paramount, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html#:~:text=Paramount's%20strategically%20and%20financially%20compelling,process%20with%20an%20uncertain%20outcome">in a press release</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.</em>"</p>



<p>Not only does Paramount believe its offer to be the better one compared to Netflix's, it believes that Paramount acquiring Warner Bros Discovery has a better chance of getting approved than Netflix acquiring Warner Bros Discovery.</p>



<p>"<em>Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice</em>," the press release reads. "<em>In contrast, the Netflix transaction is predicated on the unrealistic assumption that its anticompetitive combination with WBD, which would entrench its monopoly with a 43% share of global Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) subscribers, could withstand multiple protracted regulatory challenges across the world. In many European Union countries the Netflix transaction would combine the dominant SVOD player with the number two or strong number three competitor. The Netflix transaction creates a clear risk of higher prices for consumers, lower pay for content creators and talent and the destruction of American and international theatrical exhibitors. Netflix has never undertaken large-scale acquisitions, resulting in increased execution risk which WBD shareholders would have to endure.</em>"</p>



<p>Ellison added that he and Paramount believe allowing Paramount to acquire Warner Bros Discovery would lead to "<em>a stronger Hollywood</em>," and that Paramount acquiring WBD, not Netflix, "<em>is in the best interest of the creative community, consumers and the movie theatre industry</em>."</p>



<p>It is a proper bidding war now, with both Netflix and Paramount in the ring with such incredibly high bids. Either acquisition, if accepted, would set a new record for the largest acquisition in history. Either one will also entirely change the entertainment landscape, should they go through.</p>



<p>It'll be a long time before that happens, though, as there will be a drawn-out regulatory process before either acquisition makes it over the line. Either way, the 2020s have been a massive time of change for Warner Bros, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-split-up-warnermedia-discovery-merger/">after its split in 2021</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">restructuring of its video game business</a>, and now the coming conclusion of this acquisition process, whether it ends up under Paramount or Netflix.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Could Continue With Assassin’s Creed Shadows-Style Dual Protagonists, “If We Have Good Reason To,” Says Director]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-could-continue-with-dual-protagonists-assassins-creed-shadows-style/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Not every Assassin's Creed game, but most of them, revolve around a single protagonist. That said, the most recent release in the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-culture-war-threw-ubisoft-off-making-the-publisher-focus-on-showing-how-it-was-a-game-not-a-message/">centred around dual protagonists Naoe and Yasuke,</a> with players jumping back and forth between the two as they pleased, depending on which playstyle they preferred. It wasn't an entirely new premise for the series, but according to associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/">GamesRadar,</a> it's one the studio will consider utilizing again - so long as they have a good reason to.</p>



<p>The last time Ubisoft went with dual protagonists for an Assassin's Creed game was with 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate, featuring twin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye. They had some differences, but nothing quite as stark as Naoe and Yasuke. Lemay-Comtois even says himself, "<em>The differences between Evie and Jacob were mostly cosmetic. It's more like a 'which one do you prefer?' kind of deal. They play very, very similarly, except with very few select skills.</em>"</p>



<p>There were much more tangible differences between Naoe and Yasuke, each character having weapons that the other couldn't use, and of course, each of them having entirely different playstyles between Naoe's classic stealth gameplay and Yasuke's front-door-barging gameplay. However, those differences, Lemay-Comtois points out, can divide players in their experience with the game.</p>



<p>"<em>Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It's not just a 'well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.' Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke, it's more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too.</em>" </p>



<p>Ubisoft's experience here with Naoe and Yasuke, however, won't stop the studio from going down that well again. "<em>I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future - if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting</em>."</p>



<p>Though Lemay-Comtois makes the point that it would have to make sense narratively for Ubisoft to return to dual protagonists, it's also worth wondering if dual protagonists would fit the future structure of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed games more than they may have in the past. We know from the Animus Hub and the post-launch content for Shadows that Ubisoft is working towards making its top series resemble a live service game you can keep coming back to more than a singular experience. Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-plans-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/">chief executive officer Yves Guillemot discussed earlier this year that live service and open world games would be the company's focus going forward</a>.</p>



<p>It's possible that having two characters at the forefront could open up more live service opportunities with how new in-game content is designed. That sounds like a more legitimate reason for Ubisoft to continue with dual protagonists since, realistically, they could make almost anything work within the game's narrative and setting, if Ubisoft really wanted to.</p>
