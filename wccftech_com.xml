			<p>This morning, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announ</a>ced in a press release that it has entered a strategic partnership with fellow Japanese entertainment conglomerate Bandai Namco. Sony agreed to acquire 16 million Bandai Namco shares for roughly 68 billion yen (around $465 million), gaining control of 2.5% of the company's total shares.</p>



<p>Nobuhiko Momoi, Executive Vice President at Bandai Namco Holdings Inc., said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>The Bandai Namco Group promotes an "IP axis strategy" that aims to maximize IP value by leveraging the appeal and worldview of IP, providing the optimal products and services at the optimal timing in the optimal regions. We are filled with excitement about the potential to create new entertainment by combining Sony Group's strengths and technological capabilities across various entertainment fields with Bandai Namco's IP axis strategy. Through this collaboration, we aim to connect with IP fans worldwide, co-create the future together, and realize our Purpose, "Fun for All into the Future," and Mid- to Long-term Vision, "Connect with Fans."</em></p>



<p>Toshimoto Mitomo, Chief Strategy Officer and Representative Corporate Executive Officer at Sony Group Corporation, added:</p>



<p><em>Through this partnership, we aim to co-create an array of content and experiences that exceed expectations and deliver Kando （emotion） to even more fans, alongside Bandai Namco Group, with its outstanding capacity for multidirectional expansion of diverse IP and deep connections with fans at real touchpoints, both domestically and internationally. By combining the strengths of both companies in the field of entertainment and unlocking the potential of compelling IP, we will further accelerate our efforts to maximize IP value and realize Sony's long-term vision, "Creative Entertainment Vision".</em></p>



<p>The press release mainly emphasizes that Sony will produce and distribute anime and 'other video content' based on Bandai Namco's intellectual properties. That said, the collaboration could extend to other areas like games and music. Even so, it is highly unlikely that Bandai Namco's games will become exclusive to PlayStation consoles, especially given the minuscule share percentage.</p>



<p>In late 2024, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became</a> the largest shareholder of Kadokawa Corporation (the parent company of FromSoftware) with 10% shares. However, a few months ago Tencent also <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased its own shares</a> up to nearly 8%, almost as much as Sony.</p>
