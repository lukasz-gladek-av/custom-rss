			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is getting performance and game balance improvements in the future, the game's developer confirmed in a new message shared today.</p>



<p>Today, developer Lenzee Games provided an&nbsp;overview&nbsp;of the improvements that are coming to the Soulslike released last week, including improved framerates, optimized default settings for some graphics cards, better stability, enhanced texture quality, asset detail, and precision in low-resolution areas. The development studio is also taking a good look at the game's balance, and is aiming to correct the character's raising speed after getting knocked down, reduce damage and number of certain tramps, lower impact resustance of some low level enemies, reduce <em>"exploration pressure"</em> in some areas, improve AI logic for regular enemies and bosses. Unfortunately, no timeframe has been provided as for when these improvements will be implemented, but still, it's good to know the developer is looking to fix some of the game's critical issues.</p>



<p>It's a shame WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched with its performance issues on PC and consoles, as I have found the game to be entertaining enough, despite all of its issues. Hopefully, the improvements will give the game's combat system the chance to shine, as I have found it to be the best feature of the game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">review.</a></p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly three and a half years since we first <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-amazon-prime-tv-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> about Amazon developing a God of War TV series. Back then, it was still just a rumor, albeit one reported by Deadline, one of the most reputable sources in that industry. Indeed, an official confirmation <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came later in 2022</a>. </p>



<p>However, last year we learned that the TV series had been rebooted from scratch. Amazon originally planned to employ Rafe Judkins (The Wheel of Time) as its showrunner and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby as the producers, but they left the project and were replaced by Ronald D. Moore (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, For All Mankind), who will wear multiple hats: showrunner, writer, and producer.</p>



<p>At San Diego Comic-Con 2025, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN cornered Moore</a> to get the first few details on the new God of War TV project, starting with how Moore became interested in the first place. </p>



<p><em>I started looking at the cutscenes together, and there's so much material there, and I really responded to the characters. I responded to the story of Kratos and his son, and then they set out on this epic journey in this world that was finely detailed and really interesting, and there's a lot of combat and interesting monsters along the way. But I kept coming back to this story of father and son, and it was just emotional and it was different, and I hadn't seen anything like that before, and I had no expectations because like you said, I'm not a gamer. I knew the title, but I didn't really know what the story was, so I didn't really know what I was going to be looking at, and I was just taken with it. And so I said, yeah, I'd love to do it. I think it's really interesting.</em></p>



<p>When asked whether he played any of the God of War games, Moore replied that he tried, but he just doesn't have the muscle memory for it. Even so, Moore assured fans that the tone of the show will be very similar:</p>



<p><em>The tone of the show is trying to emulate the tone of the game, which is there's this epic journey, this heartfelt story of these two men setting out on this thing to honor the memory of his wife, Atreus’ mother. So it has this emotional heart, but there's this sense of history of who Kratos is, this mystery about his past, what he represents, the emotions that he's going through. So there's a weight to it, but not so much weight that there's not enjoyment along the way and there's spectacle and there's lots of things going on in this world.</em></p>



<p>Of course, it's still way too early to ask about any release for the God of War TV show. The casting will have to come next, with fans already banging the drums of their favorite actors. Who would you like to see as Kratos, Atreus, Laufey, Baldur, Freya, Thor, Mímir, and the others? Let us know below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lost Soul Aside Shown in Brand New Gameplay]]></title>

			<p>The action game Lost Soul Aside is finally just a month away from its release, and there's no better way to sustain the hype than by checking out a brand new gameplay video. Luckily, one was posted by Chinese YouTuber A9VG, who recently went hands-on with the game.</p>



<p>According to the YouTuber, the game's combat system is based on skills, which can be varied by holding light or heavy attacks rather than complex movesets. With simplified stamina management, accessibility is a clear goal, but there's also space for more skilled players to shine through precise counterattacks and even high-damage follow-ups of combos.</p>



<p>There won't be any difficulty options to select from in Lost Soul Aside. However, the game does offer 'powerful buffs' and even gear to players who die repeatedly, in an effort to help them out.</p>



<p>Exploration is said to be very linear, as you would expect in such a game. Some platforming elements are reportedly integrated in the levels, though. Character progression is available for both weapons and skills, which can be upgraded through a talent tree. There are four types of weapons: one-handed swords, greatswords, scythes, and a 'gun-sword', each providing a different playstyle.</p>



<p>Players can also reportedly craft various potions with different effects, including healing and combat buffs. Moreover, Lost Soul Aside includes an arena and boss challenges to help players improve and obtain enhancement materials.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside started development from a single man, Yang Bing, in 2014. For a long time, it was just him, until the project started getting noticed after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-amazing-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first few stunning trailers</a>. Yang Bing was then invited by Sony to join the so-called China Hero Project, getting the chance to expand the team and improve the game.</p>



<p>The game will be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment simultaneously on PlayStation 5 and PC (a first for a single player game) on August 29, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following a small delay</a>. On PC, Lost Soul Aside, which is powered by Unreal Engine 4 (owing to its long development), <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-trio-of-upcoming-action-games-running-at-up-to-500-fps/">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> Multi Frame Generation and ray tracing effects. You can find the full system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
