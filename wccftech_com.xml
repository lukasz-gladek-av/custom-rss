			<p>Mario Kart 9 may not be an instant smashing success on Nintendo Switch 2 due to the incredible popularity its predecessor still enjoys today, according to former Nintendo of America employees.</p>
<p>In a new video, former Nintendo of America employees Kit and Krysta discussed the next entry in the series, which was the only game shown during the brief Nintendo Switch 2 reveal back in January, saying that it may have a hard time matching the success of Mario Kart 8, at least in the beginning, due to how successful the game is and how it continues to be an extremely popular game due to the support it has received for years after release. Given how difficult it may be for a kid, for example, to convince a parent to purchase a brand-new system just to play Mario Kart 9, which may not look that different from its predecessor to the uninitiated eye, the two former Nintendo employees think that it will be difficult for the game to do better than the 75 million copies the game sold to date combining the sales of the original Wii U release and the Deluxe Switch release. An amazing result, considering how the Switch port was almost an afterthought after the sales of the Wii U release, which were far from amazing.</p>

<p>While much of the Nintendo Switch 2's launch success will likely rely on Mario Kart 9, it's unlikely the new entry in the series will be the system's only<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/"> first-party launch title</a>. Thankfully, we will finally learn more about what else is in store for the new system next week, on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd.</a></p>

			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan will get additional content for free sometime in May, the game's Creative Director confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a new<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543353138838503653?l=english"> Dev Note post</a> detailing the game's very first balance patch, Creative Director Junho Lee confirmed that a free DLC content update will be released sometime in May. As the new content is still in development, more details will be shared once it's closer to completion. Additional updates featuring some unspecified improvements will also be released in the near future, some of them as early as next week.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new The First Berserker: Khazan balance patch was released today to mark the game's official release following a few days of early access. As part of an effort to keep the game challenging yet fair, the developers introduced some balance adjustments, which include increased damage for the Greatsword Brutal Attack skill, a resource cost adjustment for the Phantom: Heatwave Spear skill, some boss balance adjustments, such as reduced difficulty for the Viper and Maluca boss fights, increased power of certain bosses that felt weaker than they should have, improved benefits for Easy Mode and more.</p>
<p>While I found The First Berserker: Khazan to be a balanced game overall, I had very little doubt that the Maluca boss fight would be adjusted following release, as it was one of the most difficult bosses in the game, requiring excellent knowledge of all the defensive options the game has to offer. Hopefully, these balance adjustments will help more players get into the game, as it is an action RPG that is more than worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/"> review.</a></p>

			<p>EA Sports has officially unveiled F1 25. This year's edition of the licensed FIA Formula One World Championship racing game will debut on May 30 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now, with the Standard Edition priced at $59.99 and the Iconic Edition priced at $79.99. All pre-orders will receive the F1 75 Celebration Pack (suit, gloves, and livery). The Standard Edition also gets the F1 World Starter Pack (10K cash and F1 World Resources) and 5,000 PitCoin. The Iconic Edition, on the other hand, will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lewis Hamilton Iconic Pack</li>
<li>Lewis Hamilton F1 World Event in F1 24</li>
<li>3 days of early access</li>
<li>F1 The Movie â€“ Chapter Scenarios</li>
<li>APXGP Team Pack</li>
<li>Collection of 2025 season liveries immediately in Time Trial in F1 24</li>
<li>F3 Driver Icons</li>

<li>One month of F1 TV Pro subscription (only for US customers)</li>
</ul>
<p>F1 25 includes Braking Point 3, the latest chapter in the series' story mode, with Konnersport now battling for championships as a dramatic event throws the team into chaos. Braking Point 3 comes with multiple difficulty settings in an attempt to cater to returning vets and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>The popular My Team game mode has been improved. Players will now be calling the shots as the owners of their F1 team. On the track, F1 25 will feature the latest version of the EGO engine, which Codemasters says will deliver enhanced circuit authenticity powered by LIDAR technology. More details on the gameplay features and innovations will be revealed in the coming weeks through the F1 25 Deep Dive series. Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters, said:</p>
<p><em>F1 25 delivers more ways for players to experience Formula 1 and race their way, from the drama of Braking Point to making headlines in the pursuit of World Championship glory. This year, there are new opportunities for players to connect, collaborate, and compete than ever before. We look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3059520/F1_25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for F1 25 also lists the game's minimum and recommended requirements.&nbsp;<span>By the way, they're nearly identical to those listed for&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 24</a></span>, so don't expect big visual improvements.</p>

			<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CrystalDynamics/status/1904969991968956833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>, Crystal Dynamics made the announcement that they have made the "difficult decision" to reduce the workforce by 17 team members. The studio is most well-known for the Tomb Raider, Legacy of Kain, and Gex series. Most recently, they have released the Tomb Raider remasters as well as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered, with Perfect Dark and an untitled Tomb Raider game to be announced in the future.</p>
<p>The full statement reads as follows below:</p>
<p><em>This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.</em></p>
<p><em>We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.</em></p>
<p><em>Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans.</em></p>
<p>As said above, Crystal Dynamics is most recently known to be working on an untitled Tomb Raider game as well as a reboot of the Perfect Dark series, with Amazon Games and Xbox Game Studios publishing the titles, respectively.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and is set to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally being developed utilizing Unreal Engine 4, but instead, the developers are now using Unreal Engine 5 to increase efficiency. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-perfect-dark-reboot-crystal-dynamics-embracer/">The Initiative</a> is also helping to develop the title, it was reported in October 2024 that Brian Horton had left the Insomniac Games studio to instead work as a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Director on Perfect Dark</a>.</p>
<p>The last round of layoffs for Crystal Dynamics took place in 2023 when nine employees were laid off across the marketing division specifically. This took place at a time where its parent company, <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-announces-restructuring-program-crystal-dynamics-says-its-not-affected/">Embracer Group</a>, was making devastating layoffs across its many subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Any layoff, no matter the number, is devastating to hear about, but compared to some of the others that have already taken place this year, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/5-years-after-avengers-2-years-after-its-last-layoffs-and-who-knows-how-long-before-perfect-dark-and-tomb-raider-return-crystal-dynamics-announces-another-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only seen 27 layoffs</a> in a total of three years, while some companies have <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed/">experienced closures</a>, multiple layoffs in a year, and worse.</p>
<p>Already this year, there have been an <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated 1,493 employees</a> laid off across a number of studios, ranging from well-off triple-A studios to indie studios finding their footing.</p>
