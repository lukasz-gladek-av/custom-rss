			<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/?dm_i=2AEH,217EC,AMZC5B,7CM2V,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting is now open</a> for Ultimate Game of the Year and Best Game Adaptation in the Golden Joystick Awards. If you've been wanting an opportunity to vote for your favorite game this year, the Golden Joystick Awards is the perfect opportunity. There are plenty of categories to vote in this year, and you can choose from categories such as Best Indie Game, Studio of the Year, and New Best Audio Design. In total, there are<a href="https://wccftech.com/voting-is-now-open-in-the-42nd-golden-joystick-awards/"> 21 categories</a> to vote in this year, and as mentioned by Daniel Dawkins, this year has seen the most votes ever in their initial round of categories.</p>
<p>In a statement made by Daniel Dawkins, the Content Director of Games, Video, and Digital Events, he said that there has been "a record ten million+ votes in our initial round of categories... Ultimate Game of the Year is our most prestigious award which sits in its own voting window from November 4 to November 8, allowing the judging panel more time to assess the big winter releases."</p>
<p>Although this year has been somewhat quiet in terms of big releases, it has also seen the release of iconic games such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Tekken 8, and even games like Balatro and Satisfactory becoming big hits. In a world where people didn't have faith in the Silent Hill 2 remake, it was released and was done justice by Bloober Team and Konami, who knocked it out of the park. There are a lot of fantastic games to choose from on the nominations list for Ultimate Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, and here are all of the nominees for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Well</li>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
<li>Helldivers 2</li>
<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
<li>Satisfactory</li>
<li>Silent Hill 2</li>
<li>Tekken 8</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Ultimate Game of the Year award, you can now vote for the Best Game Adaptation, where you've seen your favorite characters and franchises come to life on the big screen. Here are the nominations for that category in the Golden Joystick Awards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borderlands</li>
<li>Fallout</li>
<li>Halo Season 2</li>
<li>Knuckles</li>
<li>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</li>
<li>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</li>
</ul>
<p>The Golden Joy Stick Awards will be taking place on November 21, where it will be live via YouTube, Twitch, Steam, Facebook, X, the Future Games Show, GamesRadar, PC Gamer, and TechRadar Gaming, offering you a multitude of places to watch it. If you don't want to sit through the awards, the winners will be announced on social media as the ceremony progresses, so you don't have to miss a beat.</p>

			<p>A new update for Lords of the Fallen is launching today, thanks to creators CI Games and HEXWORKS. With this update comes a brand new tutorial, updates to the Umbral system, and some gameplay balancing to provide a smoother experience for those who are getting stuck into the game. In addition, Update 1.6 for Lords of the Fallen adds the PS5 Pro enhancement update, which provides a ton of graphical improvements for those who plan on picking up the game. One of the most critical parts of the update, other than the graphical improvements, is the enhanced onboarding and tutorial experience, which is provided to newcomers after they receive feedback from veteran players.</p>
<p>With the gameplay and performance enhancements for the PS5 Pro, it adds a 40% increase in pixel density, with an enhanced Performance Mode that means the game will run at 4K60 based on 1440p, and the Quality Mode will run at a native 4K30. The nitty-gritty of these enhancements was already covered prior and you can read all of that info on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate this major update, the standard version of Lords of the Fallen will be on a 50% discount on Steam from 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT through to November 11, costing $29.99. As stated above, the onboarding system is now a lot more gradual and kinder to allow players to get used to the ebb and flow of Lords of the Fallen. This includes the Umbral Lamp capabilities, as well as better navigation through the tutorial area, which previously was tripping players up and made it difficult to get to grips with the traversal system.</p>
<p>One of the most highly requested features for this update was to give players more time to thoroughly explore Umbral, the second realm that you could hop into and explore, which ran alongside the core world. There have been some changes to Umbral to make it a bit more accessible overall, which includes making the soundscapes subtler, as well as adjustments to the enemy spawn curve to improve the overall pacing of the secondary realm and a reduced vignette effect, which was previously quite significant and could smother some of the details of the Umbral Realm.</p>
<p>This update for Lords of the Fallen is available now on Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 and will be available for the PS5 Pro as of November 7, with the all-new graphical enhancements as listed in their announcement.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the patch notes' nitty-gritty and what else was changed besides these significant factors, they have uploaded the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1501750/announcements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full patch notes</a>, which tell you what you can expect from Lords of the Fallen now in update 1.6.</p>
