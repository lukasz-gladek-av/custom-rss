			<p>EA is going to be acquired by an investor consortium for $55 billion, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">widely rumored last week.</a></p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">press release shared today</a>, the publisher of successful titles like the Battlefield series, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">highly anticipated sixth entry is launching next month on PC and consoles</a>, confirmed it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor consortium comprised of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an all-cash transaction of $55 billion. Going into further details, the agreement's terms indicate the Consortium will acquire 100% of EA, with PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company.</p>



<p>The press release continues that the acquisition agreement was given the go-ahead by the EA's Board of Directors after the opportunity was carefully evaluated. According to Luis A. Ubiñas, the Lead Independent Director of the board, it was concluded that the opportunity delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders.</p>



<p>Although EA has entered into the acquisition agreement, the transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, and will be subject to closing conditions, including approval of regulatory bodies and EA stockholders. After the transaction is closed, EA's common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p>



<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of EA, commented on the news, saying:<em> "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work. Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</em></p>

			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/">supposedly launching next year</a> is reportedly going to use a hybrid engine setup with Unreal Engine 5 and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine, as well as modern gameplay features and tweaked level design.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming"> Rebs Gaming</a>, who proved their reliability in the past by reporting correct information before official announcements, such as the launch date for Halo Infinite multiplayer component, reported some new details on the rumored remake, relied by an unnamed source who received it from a developer who works for a co-development studio which has previously worked with 343 Industries on the Halo: The Master Chief Collection and is now handling a lot of the remake's core development.</p>



<p>According to the new information, the current Halo Combat Evolved remake build features sprinting, which is not available in the original. Although the introduction of a modern FPS gameplay mechanic can be divisive, its inclusion would be hardly surprising, considering series co-creator Marcus Lehto talked about more contemporary core mechanics that improve gameplay among features of a potential remake that would enhance the original experience. Regarding gameplay, the remake is said to feature tweaked level design for maps like The Library.</p>



<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake will also reportedly be powered by two engines like this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, using Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay logic and world systems. This setup would ensure modern visuals and faithful gameplay, although using UE5 for graphics could lead to performance issues, as we have seen time and time again in way too many games released in the past few months, especially if <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-performance-issues-caused-development-process/">optimization work is not done properly, as suggested by Epic CEO last month</a></p>

<p>Although Rebs Gaming has proved to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new information, and even the development of a Halo Combat Evolved remake, with a grain of salt. Thankfully, it shouldn't take much longer to learn if the game is really in development, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo Studios will reveal the future of the series at HaloWC 2025 next month.</a></p>

			<p>Game developers have often criticized the Xbox Series S for its lower specifications, which made ports troublesome, but there have also been a few voices claiming the contrary. Recently, Ripple Effect <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Battlefield 6 was better optimized due to the development team's work to optimize the game for Microsoft's less expensive Xbox console.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with Windows Central</a>, Square Enix's programmer and director Naoki Hamaguchi has now said that the Xbox Series S has solid specs and his team did not encounter many issues with the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade port, except for the memory (the Series S has only 10GB of RAM).</p>



<p><em>In terms of hardware specs, I would say the Xbox Series S is actually quite solid in terms of spec. We didn't come across much of a processing challenge, but many of the challenges were more memory related. Optimization is something we were strongly cognizant of as we worked on the PC version as well. For Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we took some of the philosophies found in Nanite for Unreal Engine 5 and created our own solution for Unreal Engine 4. We were successful in delivering stable graphics there, and gained Steam Deck verification as well. We have been pretty proud of what we were able to achieve, even on lower spec systems.</em></p>



<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade port is coming to Xbox Series S and X as well as Nintendo Switch 2 on January 22, 2026. They also added that the whole trilogy will eventually be available on all main platforms (including PlayStation 5 and PC, of course). We don't know yet when Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will launch on Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2. We also do not know whether the third chapter in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy will launch simultaneously for all these consoles or still as a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive, as was the case with the first two installments.</p>

			<p>The new PlayStation 5 CFI-2100 model <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-digital-edition-revision-amazon/">released in Europe this month</a> may have a smaller SSD, but it introduces some welcome improvements, including one for a well-known <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">critical liquid metal cooling issue that has damaged plenty of systems already.</a></p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@austinevans">Austin Evans</a> takes a good look at the new hardware revision of Sony's current generation console, highlighting some changes over the previous models besides the inclusion of an 825 GB SSD over the 1 TB SSD of previous version of the system, which is a considerable downgrade for the Digital Edition of the system considering how much storage space games require nowadays.</p>



<p>The first notable change is purely aesthetic. The design of the new PlayStation 5 hardware revision remains identical to the current Slim design, but without the glossy finish. Although minimal, some may prefer this look, which is more in line with the launch models regarding the faceplates.</p>



<p>Every other change over the previous model is internal. Among the most notable changes are the inclusion of more NAND modules, three over the two of the earlier models, and ridges for the liquid metal cooling solution like those seen in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">PlayStation 5 Pro. </a></p>



<p>This addition is extremely welcome, as without those ridges, liquid metal can drip down if the console is placed vertically, causing dry spots on the APU, which can heavily compromise its functionality. Despite having had my launch model vertically since day one, I never had any of these issues as others did, so not every older model is affected by this problem. Still, these ridges are welcome additions that should ensure these systems stay functional longer.</p>



<p>The above changes are only some the new PlayStation 5 hardware revision offers. You can learn more about the reduced weight of the system and its better efficiency in the full teardown below.</p>

<p>The new base PlayStation 5 hardware revision, whose release in the United States is still uncertain, is reportedly being followed by a PlayStation 5 Pro revision. Little is known about this new model, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">changes are expected to be minimal.</a></p>
