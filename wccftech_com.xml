            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/squid-game-event-rumored-to-have-additional-premium-pass-in-cod-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's rumored that Call of Duty will be receiving an additional premium pass for the Squid Game event that is coming soon to <a href="https://wccftech.com/eight-of-octobers-best-selling-games-were-new-releases-black-ops-6-on-top/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Call of Duty: Warzone. The event was officially teased yesterday, where it's said that those who participate in the event will be able to get skins of operatives themed around the hit TV show, as well as blueprints of weapons and other content that fits the Squid Game theme. The crossover event is set to begin on January 3, but more details haven't been released.</p>
<p>This is already causing quite a stir from both Squid Game fans and Call of Duty fans, with some saying that they're completely missing the point of the TV show. The TV show is all about living in a dystopian, capitalist world where people are willing to fight to the death for money. The show just recently got a second season, which was released yesterday on Netflix.</p>

<p>The rumor of the premium pass comes from a user called <a href="https://x.com/xFleXy_/status/1872710285649428579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xFleXy_ on X</a>, where they posted a screenshot of a message that pops up when you load the game. The message reads as the following:</p>
<p><em>Squid Game arrives in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone. Explore an exhilarating Event Pass, where the Premium Track route allows for more incredible rewards, including the Front Man Operator. Plus, a myriad of LTM's will feature signature sinister takes on Red Light/Green Light mechanics.</em></p>
<p>A lot of people also have issues with the game having premium battle passes due to the fact that a significant amount of people who purchased the game would have paid at least $70 for it rather than playing it via Xbox Game Pass for the long haul. Seeing a paid game with a ton of microtransactions is never a great feeling, and it makes more sense for the event pass to be in Call of Duty: Warzone, as that is the free-to-play Battle Royale set in the CoD universe.</p>
<p>It hasn't been specified how much this pass will cost as of yet, but as the event looms closer, there will most likely be new details given about the event and the rewards that you will be able to obtain by participating.</p>
<p>Will you be getting the battle pass for the Squid Game event?</p>

			<p>A team of modders is working to add multiplayer to Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man on PC, and they've got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8e-Q2l_ek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a> to prove it already works. The original game, of course, offered no such feature, and neither did the sequel, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-co-op-mode-teased-by-miles-morales-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-lived rumors</a> and the fact that you do actually collaborate with the other Spider-Man (both Peter Parker and Miles Morales are playable <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the game</a>, and you can swap between them while in the open world), but only as an NPC.</p>
<p>However, Insomniac did at least toy with the idea several times. Back in 2021, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-new-multiplayer-game-pve-melee-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a multiplayer game with PvE (player versus environment) melee combat. That turned out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-leak-spider-gwen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man: The Great Web</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game that leaked as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac's hack</a>. The game would have allowed five players to take the roles of various members of the Spider family, including Spider-Gwen.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Marvel's Spider-Man, though. Modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-remastered-code-includes-co-op-multiplayer-mode-references/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified</a> multiplayer references in the game's code as early as two years ago. There might have been some hooks they're now using in the project. The team has shared the following FAQ on its Discord:</p>
<p><em>When is this mod coming out?</em><br>
<em>No release date as of yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there PVP?</em><br>
<em>No, it currently isn't a feature to fight other players in Multiplayer but it may get looked at in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the Player Limit?</em><br>
<em>The Player Limit in Spider-Man Multiplayer is 16 players.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a mod for MSM1 or MSM2?</em><br>
<em>This is a mod for MSM1, however we will look into porting to MSM2 once it releases.</em></p>
<p><em>Does the main story work?</em><br>
<em>Some main story missions do work but we're working on free roam content currently and will look into main story more at a later date.</em></p>
<p><em>Do mods work?</em><br>
<em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Can my friends see my mods?</em><br>
<em>Friends can see your suit mods so long as you both have the same suit mods installed. If you don't then the person who doesn't have the suit mod installed will not be able to see the person with the suit. Additionally if you use animation mods it's better for all players to have it installed.</em></p>
<p><em>How long has this mod been under development?</em><br>
<em>This mod has been in development since August 2024.</em></p>
<p><em>How does connecting to players work?</em><br>
<em>You create a lobby, and then other players can either join via a Steam invite or you can add the host's IP and join that way.</em></p>
<p><em>What platforms are supported?</em><br>
<em>Steam and Epic Games Store versions are the supported Marvel's Spider-Man copies in which multiplayer will work.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Spider-Man Multiplayer Trailer (Mod)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nu8e-Q2l_ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, there's many ways this could go wrong. Mod teams blow up all the time, either due to insurmountable technical hurdles, internal drama, or just plain old real life commitments (they're not professionals, after all). Sony could also kick the Marvel's Spider-Man multiplayer mod to the curb to prevent it from being released. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did it</a> for the Breath of the Wild mod, effectively killing it.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of instances where this actually worked<span><span>â€”more or less.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-together-reborn-co-op-mod-is-finally-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyrim Together</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sekiro-online-mod-pvp-coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sekiro multiplayer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wccftech.com/just-cause-3-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Cause 3 multiplayer</a> are some of the most famous examples of multiplayer mods successfully added to single-player only games</span>.</span> Another interesting project to keep track of is '<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberMP</a>,' which plans to introduce multiplayer to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

			<p>While 2024 didn't see the release of new entries in staple franchises like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, the past 12 months were still very good for action games fans thanks to the release of a variety of very solid games coming from both veterans of the genre and newcomers that left more than a few players surprised with the high level of competence shown in their debut titles, so high that it is almost difficult to tell that they haven't been developed by studios with more experience in the action games genre.</p>
<p>Here are the five best action games released in 2024 on PC and consoles, alongside a few other games that, while not as good as the best five, definitely deserve to be mentioned for their quality and for what they brought to the genre as a whole.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>
<h2>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Prince-of-Persia-The-Lost-Crown-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Prince of Persia series has always been at the forefront of the action games genre, but for a very long time, the series has been away from the spotlight. The long-dormant franchise, however, was finally brought back this year with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and what a way to come back it is. Returning to the roots of the series, the game developed by Ubisoft Montpelier is an amazing Metroidvania game featuring an engaging story and extremely solid gameplay mechanics that make it not only one of the best action games released in the past few years but also one of the best Metroidvania games ever released. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action games features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Blade (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Stellar_Blade-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like with Black Myth Wukong, the hype surrounding Stellar Blade was definitely bigger than what one may have expected for a debut title of a developer who had released only mobile games up until this point, but in the end, like for Game Science's first game, Korean studio Shift Up proved they had what it takes to make a compelling action game. While the over-sexualized character design may be offputting for some players, there's no denying that the Korean developers knew what they were doing, enriching the obvious inspiration from Yoko Taro's NieR series with some light RPG and Soulslike mechanics that make the game a joy to both look at and play. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review.</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonettaâ€™s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive youâ€™ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<h2>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hellblade-II.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninja Theory released quite a few games over the course of the years, but none managed to become commercial successes, except for Hellblade: Senua's Saga, a narrative-focused game that offered solid action combat in the vein of the previous titles developed by the studio. With Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Ninja Theory doubled down on everything that made the original game so unique, keeping the oppressive atmosphere and combat system and turning it up to eleven with one of the most impressive visual showcases of the generation powered by Unreal Engine 5. A remarkable game that is definitely not for everyone, but one that is worth experiencing for those looking for an extremely immersive experience. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</em></p>
<h2>Black Myth Wukong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">8.5</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/black-myth-wukong-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Right from its out-of-the-blue announcement in late 2020, it was clear how Black Myth Wukong was going to be an extremely popular game, as the trailer showcasing the pre-alpha build reached 2 million views on YouTube and over 10 million views on Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili in just 24 hours. Being the very first PC and console game by an unproven developer, however, there was the chance that all the hype could have been for nothing, but Game Science proved detractors wrong by releasing a solid action game inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. While being based on the popular Journey to the West novel may have contributed to the game's huge popularity, especially in China, Black Myth Wukong is definitely a game that fans of the genre should experience, even if it doesn't exactly attempt to break the mold to offer anything innovative. Here's what I had to say in my review:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>
<h2>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dead Rising is among the many CAPCOM series that were put to the side following the disappointing performance on the market of their latest entry, but the Japanese publisher has been showing over the past few months that it is finally willing to bring some of these franchises back to their former glory. In this regard, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster couldn't have brought back Frank West's iconic first adventure in a better way, as exploring Willamette Parkview Mall and killing zombies with all sorts of makeshift weapons has never been so much fun.</p>
<p>While the basic experience feels a little dated, and the visual remaster leaves something to be desired in some ways, the quality-of-life improvements make this remaster-meets-remake a game that is worthy of experiencing both for veterans of the franchise and newcomers. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a solid remaster that enhances the original game with some welcome gameplay and quality-of-life improvements that go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable than ever. However, the remaster falters in the visual department, with dull colors that pale in comparison to the vibrant visuals of the original. Still, there's plenty to like in the Deluxe Remaster, as Frank West's journey to Willamette remains as engaging as ever, though the mostly faithful recreation of the original gameplay feels a little dated compared to its sequels.</em></p>
