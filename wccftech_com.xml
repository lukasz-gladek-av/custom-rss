			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler is undergoing some rather quick development, as the solid implementation seen in a recent game isn't based on the latest version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>As reported on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135898977" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, the second entry in the series released earlier this month, uses the upscaler's 9.60 version. While the high version number, by itself, suggests that PSSR has been undergoing plenty of development, as we previously only heard of much lower version numbers, a known developer on the ResetERA forums <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135903003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that version 9.60 isn't the upscaler's latest version, although they couldn't add more on the matter for the time being before checking if something changed in NDAs regarding the upscaler.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, the aforementioned developer also revealed some <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135644619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting information</a> on the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler which suggests that already available older games powered by Unreal Engine 4 may not support the upscaler beyond the initial version. According to the developer, UE4, by default, only supports the initial PSSR version, and with official support from Epic on the engine's updates not being available anymore, developers need to backport snippets of Unreal Engine 5 code to use newer SDKs and thus never versions of the PSSR more upscale. This is the reason some <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-playstation-5-pro-new-patch-updates-pssr-to-latest-version-improves-image-quality/">patches</a> took time to implement more recent versions of the upscaler, and why some games may never get support for them, as this backporting of UE5 code requires time that some development teams may not have.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the many features that define the PlayStation 5 Pro. You can learn more about the system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Former Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, widely regarded as one of the worst CEOs in gaming, believes someone else deserves that title in a textbook case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, the former Activision Blizzard CEO and former EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon revealed that they used to consider former EA and Unity CEO John Riccitiello as the worst CEO in the video game industry. At Activision, they thought that he was so bad that they hoped he would continue to be CEO so that they wouldn't have to worry about EA, and Activision would have paid for Riccitiello to be the EA CEO forever. Quite a statement, considering everything that happened at the publisher during Kotick's long tenure, which included prolonged workplace harassment, of which he was reportedly aware for years, that led to <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-california-lawsuit-discrimination-harassment/">a lawsuit in California.</a></p>

<p>Bobby Kotick has been Activision Blizzard's CEO for over two decades, sitting at the head of the publisher since he took over in 1991. He stayed as CEO for <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-kotick-depart/">a few weeks</a> after Microsoft's acquisition of the publisher finally went through as per Phil Spencer's request, and finally stepped down on January 1st, 2024. He has always been regarded by many as the actual worst CEO in gaming, although the former EA and Unity CEO could give him a run for his money, as Riccitiello has been involved in a multitude of anti-consumer controversies, including attempting back in late 2023 to introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-suffers-huge-backlash-for-runtime-fee-based-on-installs-then-rushes-to-clarify-some-points/">a runtime fee for the Unity engine</a> which would essentially charge developer per install. The backlash was so severe that Riccitiello had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/">step down as CEO of the company </a>shortly after the whole fiasco.</p>

			<p>Okami 2 is being developed using the RE Engine, and fully realizing Hideki Kamiya's vision for the game wouldn't have been possible without it.</p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kami-2-is-being-made-in-re-engine-confirmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata confirmed the long-awaited new entry in the series will indeed use the engine that has powered all major CAPCOM games since Resident Evil 7.&nbsp;The studio's experience with the engine will aid Clovers, who has no experience with it, in the development of the game.</p>
<p>As for why Okami 2 is being developed using the RE Engine, CAPCOM producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed that the engine was picked because, without it, they wouldn't have been able to realize Hideki Kamiya's artistic vision for the game. The game's director himself added that the engine is famous for <em>"showing the best of the games that they have"</em> and that it is very good <em>"expressively"</em>, so it definitely sounds like the game is going to be a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>The announcement of Okami 2 was among the biggest surprises revealed during last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">The Game Awards show</a>. The only teaser shown to date essentially confirmed that Amaterasu will come back in the new game and that it will feature an updated version of the original's unique visual style. Better yet, as already mentioned, it will be directed by Hideki Kamiya, the director of the original as well as the creator of some of the best action game series ever made, such as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.</p>
<p>Okami 2 is currently in development for yet to be confirmed platforms. Its release date has yet to be announced as well, so it may be a while until we see how the RE Engine has made it possible for Kamiya-san's vision to realize his vision.</p>
