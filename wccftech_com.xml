			<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/author-sues-bungie-for-copyright-infringement-over-destiny-2s-story">Last year</a>, writer Matthew Kelsey Martineau filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Bungie, claiming that the studio had stolen his work to create the story for Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Martineau claimed that Destiny 2's Red Legion was pulled straight from his work, which was published on WordPress in 2013 and 2014. Bungie responded with a motion to dismiss the case, saying (per <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-pushes-back-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit/">TheGamePost</a>) that Martineau's claim "<em>failed to plausibly allege that Bungie copied constituent elements of Plaintiff's work that are original, and, specifically, that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege factual copying by Bungie and that the works incorporated by reference into the Complaint are not substantially similar as a matter of law</em>."</p>
<p>Demonstrating that has become an issue, however, as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/court-denies-bungie-dismiss-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-youtube-wiki/">TheGamePost</a> reports that the court denied Bungie's dismissal claim because Bungie cannot provide the court with the original content from Destiny 2 to demonstrate the differences between Bungie and Martineau's work. Bungie can't provide the court with Destiny 2's original content because it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-content-removed-vault-beyond-light-november/">vaulted</a>, and it's now incompatible with the modern-day version of Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Bungie game director Tyson Green described why Bungie can't provide the game's original content, clarifying that "<em>the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' legacy builds can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework, which has evolved considerably since the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns were retired</em>."</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Bungie, Green's statement wasn't enough for Judge Susie Morgan, who won't accept YouTube videos of the game's original content or wikis as admissible evidence.</p>
<p>"<em>While Plaintiff does reference Destiny 2 in his complaint</em>," Judge Morgan's dismissal decision reads, "<em>he does not reference the YouTube videos containing Destiny 2 game footage, the Destinypedia pages, or the Tyson declaration.</em>"</p>
<p>Judge Morgan acknowledged that this is an extremely complicated copyright case and not typical compared to previous examples of copyright infringement, which also seems to be part of why the case is moving forward at all.</p>
<p>Vaulting content has never been popular with Destiny players, and while Bungie certainly has its reasons for doing so, those decisions are seemingly coming back to bite them in more ways than just facing the ire of players.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is undoubtedly the best-looking version of the open-world game developed by Rockstar Games, but this doesn't stop modders from taking the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>A new 4K resolution video shared by Digital Dreams shows the latest version of the fifth entry in the series by Rockstar Games running with mods such as <a href="https://www.patreon.com/crxhvrd/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreFx</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/lively-world-for-124497674">Lively World</a>, two known graphics and immersion improvement mods released for the original version of the game that were later ported to the Enhanced Edition. Needless to say, the two mods introduce noticeable enhancements that can make players forget the game initially released over a decade ago and possibly make the wait for the next entry in the series more bearable.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K100] GTA 5 Enhanced: modded CoreFX - Lively World BeyondallLimits RTX5090 RAYTRACING Graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juHYo9QMU54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of the Rockstar Games series will have to make do with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition for a while longer to experience the best the series has to offer, as Grand Theft Auto VI will not release as initially scheduled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Last week</a>, Rockstar confirmed the game will now release on May 26th, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as the studio requires additional development time to deliver the level of quality fans expect. While the public was only informed of the delay last week, the fact that the game would slip to 2026 was known for a while at Rockstar Games, due in part to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">a real desire to avoid crunch</a>, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about how this new version of the game breathes new life into the popular open-world game by checking out Alessio's analysis.</p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available for download allows users to easily tweak additional graphics settings not available in-game without modifying engine configuration files directly.</p>
<p>The Expedition 33 - Unreal Config tool, created by Bighead and now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/119?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, is a very handy tool that creates and configures engine configuration files for the game, allowing users to tweak additional graphics settings not available in-game to achieve better visuals, performance, or both. The tool, which is compatible with both the Steam and the Xbox Game Pass versions of the game, also comes with some built-in presets that can be selected as a base configuration to help users tweak these settings.</p>
<p>Though plenty of mods have been developed for the game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is absolutely enjoyable in its vanilla form, as it is one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. With an incredibly compelling story, a charming cast of endearing characters, and excellent gameplay, the debut game from Sandfall Interactive is well worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>Chief executive officer of Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games, Marek Tyminski, claims that he has data proving "'<em>modern audience' is a false myth.</em>'"</p>
<p>On his personal<a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1918051654336684343"> X account</a>, Tyminski wrote, "'<em>Modern audience' is a false myth. Data prove it now. Making games for them is a path to extinction.</em>" It's the latest seemingly culture war-related post from Tyminski, who commonly engages with and reposts statements from other culture war grifters online.</p>
<p>Previously, Tyminski has <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1906468008354062627">claimed</a> "<em>Video games have gotten way too political</em>" and that this alleged change is "<em>Not good for the industry. My company won't be part of it. Bad for gamers, bad for shareholders, and bad for talent</em>." Earlier this year,<a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-studio-dei/"> CI Games stated</a> that the studio would not integrate elements of DEI into its games moving forward.</p>
<p>He doesn't follow up his post with any kind of data or research into his claim, though it's possible he's referring to the <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1878494267762520464">polls on X he's conducted</a> on topics like whether players want to choose between body type's A/B or if they'd prefer the option say male/female.</p>
<p>Recently, Lords of the Fallen released a major 2.0 update that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">Wccftech's reviewer</a> notes is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">"<em>massive</em>"</a> improvement on the game compared to the state it launched in. Which included making Lords of the Fallen a more forgiving game to help acclimate new players when they first step into Lords of the Fallen, with modifiers provided to allow players to ramp the difficulty back up, if they choose to do so.</p>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>If you've been following Raccoon Logic in anticipation of Revenge of the Savage Planet coming out, then you're probably already aware of the journey the studio has been through to get here.</p>
<p>Founded in Montreal in 2017 as an independent team under the name Typhoon Studios and acquired two years later by Google, Typhoon would end up being hit by the collateral damage caused by Google not knowing what to do with Stadia. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-stadia-first-party-teams-shut-down-jade-raymond-leaves/">Stadia was shuttered</a>, Typhoon went with it.</p>
<p>And, as we've seen before in video games, it didn't matter that their first game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, was a hit. At least, it didn't matter to Google. Typhoon Studios quickly became <a href="https://wccftech.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-dev-reforms-raccoon-logic-sequel/">Raccoon Logic</a>, and years after those events, it feels like the team didn't lose a step in all of it. More than that, it feels like Raccoon Logic picked up an edge with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.05-00.34.07.10.png"></a></figure>

<p>The studio's ordeal with Google heavily influenced the tone of this sequel, which takes every opportunity to poke fun at corporate culture and the machinations of giant corporations. Right off the top of the game, when you land on an unknown planet, an enthused new employee of Alta Interglobal, the giant conglomerate that acquired your previous employer, Kindred Technologies, you learn that you're actually an enthused former employee of Alta Interglobal.</p>
<p>You and every other Kindred Aerospace employee were laid off while you were on your way to a planet in some backwater corner of space. You're stranded and are forced to make do with the bits of technology and everything else that Alta left behind. The message is not lost in the science-fiction of it all when Alta directly tells you that you, and the rest of the technology you have at your disposal, were left behind because it was too costly to send a ship out to get you.</p>
<p>And that's just how the game starts. As it evolves, Raccoon Logic doesn't pull any punches, and Revenge of the Savage Planet is a better game for it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.57.38.91.png"></a></figure>

<p>The absurdist commercials for products that are most certainly killing their customers or the ads for the galaxy's biggest influencer, Shama Lama Ding-Dong and his Ding-Dong Academy, which is 'guaranteed' to make you the next biggest influencer alive, all hit the right notes for me. I appreciated how Raccoon Logic walked the line in these ads and within the messages from Alta, or any other corporate caricatures, between hyperbole and something you'd believe could happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>Which is great, because the story didn't connect with me beyond that. The jokes were great, and the commentary felt sharp, but it didn't feel like it had anything behind it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.04-13.28.24.26.png"></a></figure>

<p>There wasn't a strong emotional core to hold it all together or give it any punch, which isn't the worst thing in the world. Revenge of the Savage Planet is more about its satire and providing a solid gameplay experience. It's successful at that, for the most part. Its early hours are, however, annoyingly tedious in a way that I know would have turned me off the game entirely if I hadn't been playing this for a review.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.03-20.25.41.26.png"></a></figure>

<p>If there's any advice I can give someone looking to jump into Revenge of the Savage Planet, it would be to do your best to golden-path your way through the game until you've acquired a few key upgrades. After that, the whole gameplay experience opens up in a much more engaging way, but before that, it still feels annoying to gain some momentum on a quest and in the story, shallow as it is, only for it to grind to a halt because you need to get a different upgrade.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm completely against the Metroid structure of needing to come back to an area when you have the right equipment. When that kind of game pacing works, it works because there's a period halfway through the game where I know I'm not fully kitted out, but I feel like I can take on the game's toughest challenges. Where I've found a satisfying flow to the gameplay, and have moved past the underpowered underdog feeling that the game opens with.</p>
<p>That middle ground doesn't really exist in Revenge of the Savage Planet. I felt underpowered for the majority of the game, and it wasn't until nearing one of the game's three endings that I started to feel like I had solid options for how I could approach a situation, whether that's combat, exploration, or platforming. It's unfortunate that the pacing and often tedious tasks you're asked to complete to progress dampen the experience right up to the end.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.21.25.93.png"></a></figure>

<p>Where it Revenge of the Savage Planet shines, is in the level design across the four core planets you'll visit, the creature designs, the animations, the audio work with each fire of your blaster and the soundscape of every new biome on each of the planets you'll stomp across, and the visual design of each planet. The boss fights are also solid spectacles that were welcome breaks in the gameplay to change things up for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The platforming challenges and environmental puzzles were also quite enjoyable, even if the floaty-jumping of the former took some getting used to. The combat wasn't anything to write home about, but by the time you're able to take advantage of the environmental systems at play on each planet, leaning into those systems can allow you to create a lot of your own fun. If you try to use your blaster for every situation, not only will it not work most of the time, but you'll bore yourself away from playing Revenge of the Savage Planet ever again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.04-11.54.13.36.png"></a></figure>

<p>It's every whimsical step you take and every oddball animation you see that keep you from quitting out of Revenge of the Savage Planet, and make you want to keep searching for the next upgrade. The game survives on its charm and satire, and on the gameplay still feeling good, after you put in the time to get the necessary upgrades.</p>
<p>Speaking of upgrades, I did not expect Revenge of the Savage Planet to have me very seriously thinking the whole way through that I should upgrade my PC sooner than I planned. Even at medium settings, and Racoon Logic's recommended GPU, an RTX 2060, I never went very long without some kind of framerate hitch, or full freezes for a second or longer. My PC isn't anything special, it's a very modest build, but I still have had better experiences with modern games than with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.11.10.17.png"></a></figure>

<p>I also consistently ran into UI bugs, where I had to close and re-open the journal and map because they stopped working. I even ran into an issue where the surprise launch addition of the Dave the Diver outfit was entirely missing when I loaded into the game. It took two restarts for it to reappear, which, again, isn't the biggest issue in the world. But it was yet another technical issue on top of the constant technical issues that plagued my entire time with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>
<p>It's not unplayable by any stretch, or at least it's not in this state, so even if the day-one patch can't solve all these issues, you won't be jumping into an entirely broken game. Just be aware that there's still a few touch-ups that the game clearly needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down.</p>

<p>But if you're charmed by the parts of Revenge of the Savage Planet that are working overtime to charm you, then it's worth sticking around for what can be a fun romp. Especially if you have a friend by your side, as it's easy to see how much more fun it would be to play this game in co-op.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with whimsical and cartoon-y animations, character designs, and smart level design that strengthens the gameplay experience when it opens up to you fully. The problem, is getting to that point, with tedious missions and upgrade pacing that halt any momentum it starts to build, and with it lacking a story with any real punch, if the charm isn't working for you, it's unlikely, and understandable, if you don't stick around long enough for it to start clicking.</p>
