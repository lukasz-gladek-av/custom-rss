			<p>It's no secret that Marvel Games and PlayStation's Insomniac Games have a good relationship. We wouldn't have three <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man games</a> and one upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">Marvel's Wolverine game</a> without a strong relationship between both companies, and in a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/11/04/general-manager-sheds-light-on-future-of-marvel-games">Game Informer</a>, we got a bit more insight into just how good Marvel feels about the relationship.</p>



<p>General manager of Marvel Games, Haluk Mentes, spoke at length about the importance of Marvel Games and the studios it collaborates with being aligned in their approach to making anything with Marvel characters, and making something that is authentically Marvel.</p>



<p>"<em>The challenge is more complex: authenticity doesn't necessarily mean one-to-one fidelity to source or reference material, whether it's comics or animation or movies. It's much deeper in that we allow our collaborating teams to reimagine 'familiar yet original' incarnations of our characters based on their own creative DNA...We absolutely do not want to be derivative. Otherwise, what's the point of working with some of the best talent out there?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>There’s a great sense of responsibility at play here: Marvel is an almost 90-year-old creative brand, yet it’s as fresh as ever because during all that time, each new generation grew up with Marvel, ultimately became creators and left their mark, and then passed the torch to the next generation.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We also actively seek collaborators that want to take on the same mantle. As is usually the case, once we complete a project together, they, too, become “Marvel.” Marvel’s Wolverine with our dear friends at Insomniac Games is perhaps the epitome of this philosophy. We have been working together for more than a decade and developed such a shorthand across multiple Marvel’s Spider-Man games that when the time finally came to bring Logan back in spectacular and visceral fashion, it was obvious to everyone on our team that Insomniac was the perfect choice. It was our shared culture and values that brought us together, and we’re so proud to continue collaborating for many years to come.</em>"</p>
