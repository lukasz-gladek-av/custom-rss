			<p>Konami and Virtuos have <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/news/us/en/update_112">pushed a new patch</a> to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater with update 1.1.2 that addresses several gameplay issues and issues causing game crashes, but doesn't directly address performance issues that players have been experiencing.</p>



<p>It addresses issues with the crocodile cap that caused the game to crash, problems with Snake floating in the air after rolling, and issues that soft-blocked player progression, along with a few more fixes. Here's the full patch notes:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Resolved an issue where performing consecutive survival knife attacks to secure food could cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while equipped could cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed crashes that could occur when collecting food near a hungry crocodile under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Corrected an issue where transitioning from a roll into a crawl could cause the character model to float in mid-air.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where player movement could become restricted under certain conditions in areas where Intrusion View is used.</em></li>



<li><em>Resolved an issue where the game could crash under certain conditions while in Radio Window.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>These fixes are great, but it's not necessarily the patch that players are waiting for. Snake Eater is the latest Unreal Engine 5 game to launch with performance issues, and while Konami doesn't directly say anything about those issues in these patch notes, it does have a concluding line on the website saying, "<em>Please rest assured that we are actively investigating and addressing all reported concerns.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, those fixes come sooner than later, though it would be nicer if we didn't have to worry about Unreal Engine 5 games launching with performance issues at all, which, according to Epic Games chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-performance-issues-caused-development-process/">a problem caused by the developers and their development process, not the engine itself</a>. </p>
