			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/02/xbox-game-pass-december-2025/">announced the first batch</a> of Xbox Game Pass games heading to the service for the first half of December, with Mortal Kombat 1 and Lunar Software's ROUTINE headlining the games this month. And while most months are about the new games joining the service, December's lineup is also about games already on the service becoming available to players at the lower-level Premium and Essential tiers.</p>



<p>Starting with the new games, ROUTINE and Death Howl are the two titles entering the service this month that are day one releases into Xbox Game Pass. The former is a game that some people <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">have been waiting for over a decade for, after it was initially announced back in Gamescom 2012</a>. The latter is a Soulslike deck builder. </p>



<p>Mortal Kombat 1 is the big triple-A addition this month, though it's also a direct series trade, because as this game enters the service, Mortal Kombat 11 will exit the service as of December 15. You could even make the point that ROUTINE is another like-for-like trade, because while it joins the service, Still Wakes the Deep also exits on December 15.</p>



<p>As far as what's becoming available to more than just players paying for Game Pass Ultimate, the big headlining title is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Of course, it was already on Game Pass, but it was only available for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Now, it's available to players paying for the middle-tier Premium Game Pass subscription, along with 33 Immortals, which is still currently in a 'game preview' state on Game Pass.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, World War Z, Stellaris, and Medieval Dynasty are all now available at the base-level Essential Game Pass tier. Lastly, a small additional note on this month's Game Pass announcements is that Xbox has started to identify games that are optimized for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X handhelds</a> in these Xbox Wire posts. </p>



<p>It'll now list "<em>Handheld</em>" as an available platform for a game, which is a good indicator, even if in reality all of the games available on PC Game Pass are available on the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of Xbox Game Pass games for the first half of December 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage - December 2 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Monster Train 2 - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Spray Paint Simulator - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>World War Z: Aftermath - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>Stellaris - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>Medieval Dynasty - December 3 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Essential and up</li>



<li>33 Immortals - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>ROUTINE - December 4 - PC, Cloud, Console, Handheld - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>A Game About Digging A Hole - December 9 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Death Howl - December 9 - PC, Handheld - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Dome Keeper - December 9 - PC, Cloud, Console, Handheld - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 1 - December 10 - PC, Cloud, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Bratz: Rhythm and Style - December 11 - PC, Cloud, Console - Game Pass Premium and up</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as what is leaving the service, as previously mentioned, Mortal Kombat 11 and Still Wakes the Deep will exit on December 15, along with Wildfrost. Following that, on December 31, Hell Let Loose and Carrion will also leave the service.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that this batch of games takes us all the way to December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">which is also the day of The Game Awards</a>. Perhaps that's because Xbox will be announcing and shadow-dropping a new title on Game Pass that day. We'll see how that develops.</p>

			<p>The development team behind Battlefield 6, collectively known as Battlefield Studios (DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a detailed update</a> on how their kernel-level Javelin anti-cheat system has been performing in combating cheats in the popular first-person military shooter game.</p>



<p>According to data gathered by the developers, Javelin ensured that roughly 98% of online Battlefield 6 matches in the game's launch week were effectively cheat-free. This means there was only a 2% 'Match Infection Rate', an admittedly nebulous data point that the developers describe as the chance that players would encounter a cheater in their matches. </p>



<p>The 98% rate was attributed mainly to the improvements made during the Open Beta weekend. At first, 'only' 93.1% of the matches were cheat-free, but that figure was raised to almost 98% by the final day after blocking over 1.2 million cheat attempts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing tens of thousands of cheaters</a>. Secure Boot adoption had increased from 62.5% to 92.5%, as well.</p>



<p>During the launch weekend of Battlefield 6, Javelin prevented over 367K cheating attempts. That's fewer than during comparable Open Beta weekends, but it's consistent with the current number of cheating developers the developers had tracking. To date, this figure has grown to 2.39 million blocked cheat attempts. Battlefield Studios is currently aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, resellers, and their associated communities. Since launch, 183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely.</p>



<p>That doesn't mean the fight against Battlefield 6 cheats is over. Beyond the requirement of Secure Boot, developers are exploring additional features already available at the operating system level, such as HVCI (Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity) and VBS (Virtualization-Based Security). Furthermore, they will continue to work with console partners to ban cheating hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as the Cronus Zen</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 just ended <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its free multiplayer trial event</a>. The game is about to receive its Winter Offensive update in a week. Winter Offensive will add a new map, mode and weapon; players will roam the streets of Brooklyn with below freezing temperatures, forced to seek Heat Zones to prevent health drain in the limited-time Ice Lock event, battle other teams in the limited-time Ice Lock Gauntlet variant, and unlock the new Ice Climbing Melee Axe.</p>



<p>You can learn more about it <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our full Season 1 preview</a>.</p>
