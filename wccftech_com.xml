			<p>Bloober Team is currently in their redemption arc, as they managed to pull off a brilliant remake of one of the best survival horror games ever made. You can read our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 review from Chris Wray here</a>. Shortly after the release, Bloober Team unveiled their upcoming horror game named Cronos: The New Dawn. The reveal didn't particularly provide any in-depth looks at the gameplay. Instead, the reveal focused more on the atmosphere and the theme of the game, which shows that it looks somewhat similar to games like Resident Evil, Prey, and Dead Space.</p>
<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://mp1st.com/news/bloobers-cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-will-feature-a-special-mechanic-to-spice-things-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive interview with MP1st</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn's Game Director, Wojciech Piejko, spoke about what to expect from the upcoming horror game and that the combat will be leaning towards that of Resident Evil and Dead Space.&nbsp;They've also said that they will be implementing a combat mechanic that will "spice" things up but didn't state what that mechanic may be. There have been many survival horror games throughout the years that have a unique combat mechanic. This has been seen in games like Dead Space, Alan Wake, and, to some degree, even Scorn.</p>
<p>In the interview, Piejko states that while there will be combat involved in the game, the team is "still storytellers at heart," saying that there will be a strong emphasis on story and atmospheric exploration. Some of the most well-known games from Bloober Team include Layers of Fear and Layers of Fear 2, which are very story-heavy. Those games are predominantly walking simulators where you pick up items and solve puzzles to reveal more of the story. However, they have also created games like Observer, Blair Witch, and The Medium. Some of their games have performed better than others, but overall, their reputation prior to the Silent Hill 2 remake wasn't fantastic.</p>
<p>During the interview, Piejko did give away a few minor details about the game and what to expect. "The Traveler relies on suit, weapons, and abilities but is still very vulnerable to the monstrosities lurking in the ruins of an old world. You will be outnumbered, and you need to be careful to stay alive. Resources are limited and the monsters hit hard."</p>
<p>While this doesn't provide much, it does give an insight into how hard they plan on leaning into the survival horror element of the game.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is due for release in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>Will you be picking this game up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-fortnite-chapter-6-trailer-leaks-early-shows-off-godzilla/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Fortnite Chapter 6 launch trailer has leaked early, and has revealed that Godzilla and some other bosses will be making their way into the incredibly popular Battle Royale. The trailer has yet to be officially released by Epic Games, but data miners did what they do best and found it within the game files, as seen on the <a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X account Guille_GAG</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Chapter 6 Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwo6rD62Gsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this new gameplay trailer, you get to see a glimpse at some of the new skins and bosses that will be available in the upcoming Chapter. You also get to see Godzilla, who is walking around the map, according to the trailer. At the moment, it's uncertain whether Godzilla is a boss that you'll be able to take down in Fortnite, but considering that the new map is Japan-inspired, it seems likely that he will be. Some of the other bosses you get to see in the trailer include a samurai, a demon mask, and a giant turtle. Although considering how cute the giant turtle is, it's more hopeful that it's a form of transportation rather than something you have to take down.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is going to be a pretty big deal in the Fortnite community, as it's set to revamp the game significantly. However, there are some features that are being brought back in this chapter that are familiar and have been in the game previously. This includes Samurai swords. From what little is seen in the trailer of them, it seems that they are used functionally the same as they were when they were previously in the game.</p>
<p>A Japan-inspired map isn't exactly new to Fortnite either, as there was a Japanese-themed biome in Chapter 4, and some of the architecture seen in the trailer feels very similar to the buildings in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>Moving on from similarities, Big Hero 6's Baymax will also be coming to Fortnite and will be available via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass</a>, where you'll get to do his signature 'Balalala' as an emote. There also seem to be some new Mask items that players will be able to get, as well as the ability to wall jump. This all seems very much to do with the Samurai vibe that they have going on in this new Chapter and will allow a new way to engage in combat as players will be able to climb over a wall and immediately start shooting or swinging their swords, as seen in the trailer.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is set to launch this weekend, and it's likely we'll see some more details emerge about the upcoming Chapter in the next day or so.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-gets-limited-chinese-closed-beta-test/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming title by Hotta Studio, Neverness to Everness, has officially launched its limited-scale Chinese Closed Beta Test that begins on November 28, 2024. This will allow players in China to explore the upcoming supernatural urban open-world RPG, and get to see some of the fresh new content that has been added by Hotta Studio. While other countries are currently unable to participate in the Closed Beta, anyone interested in the game will be able to <a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-register for Neverness to Everness</a> on the official website. There is also the option to stay up to date with any news that is released by Hotta Studio by following them on X or joining their Discord server.</p>
<p>For those who are just hearing about this game for the first time, it is a fresh and lighthearted game that is full of comedy rather than a game with a lot of serious subjects and tones. By doing so, the developers are aiming to create a relaxed atmosphere for those who play Neverness to Everness. The game's character expressions and animations have been fine-tuned to enhance each scene that players will get to watch so that the emotional nuances of each scene and humorous details can shine through in the storyline.</p>
<p>In this game, players will get to explore the everyday life of Hethereau, a city where there are both anomalies and humans co-existing. There are three chapters of main storyline content thus far and multiple side quests that players can dive into, allowing them to explore the urban life of Hethereau and the secrets that come along with it.</p>
<p>Neverness to Everness is developed using Unreal Engine 5 to help provide beautiful realism with a ton of detail, giving the players an immersive experience as they traverse the city and get to experience the supernatural. There are drastic changes between environments, with some offering neon-lit streets and marketplaces, while others are mysterious and dark, full of anomalies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">initial reveal for this game was back in July</a>, and the developers have since added more characters for Beta testers to meet and try out. This includes Adler, who is a playable character, and Edgar, who is a member of the Eibon Antique Shop and will be accompanying the protagonist throughout their adventure in Hethereau.</p>
<p>Those who get the chance to participate in the Closed Beta test will get to experience some new chapter bosses, anomaly commission bosses, and, of course, new storyline content to provide them with an in-depth experience of what's to come in the full release of the game.</p>
