			<p>SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labor practice charge against Llama Productions, an Epic Games subsidiary, over how it went about Fortnite's AI-voiced Darth Vader. The charge isn't being laid simply because Llama Productions and Epic used AI. Prior to his passing, James Earl Jones, the original voice for Darth Vader and a litany of other iconic roles, signed a deal with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23372640/star-wars-james-earl-jones-darth-vader-voice-retired-ai">Respeecher</a> to allow his archived voice-over work to be used in cases like this.</p>
<p>The charge from SAG-AFTRA comes from how Llama Productions went about using an AI version of Jones' voice. SAG-AFTRA is placing the charge because Llama Productions went the AI route "<em>without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms</em>," the organization says in a <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-fortnites-use-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-ulp-filing">statement</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>We must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games,</em>" SAG-AFTRA writes in its statement.</p>
<p>In the<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf"> actual filing</a>, the basis of the charge reads "<em>Within the past six months, the Employer [Llama Productions], by its agents and representatives, failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite</em>."</p>
<p>So it's not that generative AI was used to voice Darth Vader in Fortnite that SAG-AFTRA has a problem with, it's the fact that Llama Productions, by SAG's claims, completely went around SAG-AFTRA when working with Respeecher to bring the AI-version of James Earl Jones' voice to Fortnite.</p>
<p>As far as Jones' family is concerned, when AI Darth Vader was first showcased, his family released the following statement through Epic, saying "<em>James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character</em>."</p>
<p>Hours into AI Darth Vader being in Fortnite, players had been able to make him <a href="https://gizmodo.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-epic-games-star-wars-james-earl-jones-2000603304">swear</a> and say <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/star-wars-ai-darth-vader-racial-slurs-774932-20250519">offensive slurs</a>.</p>
<p>The strike that SAG-AFTRA actors under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) called <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">last year</a> is still ongoing, and while it wouldn't have impacted games coming out in 2025 and even games in 2026, it will begin to impact future titles if a deal cannot be reached soon. SAG-AFTRA recently published a<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftras-interactive-media-agreement-negotiating-committee-responds-video-game-employers"> rebuttal</a> to the offer put forth by game studios, which, if SAG-AFTRA had signed, would have provided no generative AI protections for any performance that came before this new deal.</p>
<p>Something that the union was clearly not going to agree to. If this is where negotiations are sitting, then it could be a long while before a deal is reached.</p>

			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-accidentally-reveals-stellar-blades-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a week ago, Sony has <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-officially-announces-stellar-blade-pc-release-date-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the action game Stellar Blade will debut on PC on June 11. However, it immediately became clear that even though the game did not require users to register for a PlayStation Network account, Stellar Blade was still <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unavailable for purchase in approximately 130 countries</a>.</p>
<p>South Korean developer Shift Up has commented on that issue and others, such as the criticized addition of the Denuvo DRM software, in a post <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923430874391118044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a>. Regarding the region lock, they are working with Sony to remedy the situation; when it comes to Denuvo, they posted a table showing that the DRM software doesn't actually decrease frame rates when playing the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We are closely discussing the region lock issue with the publisher and are doing our BEST to resolve most of it as soon as possible.</em></li>
<li><em>As shown in the test chart below, the DRM has been hard tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases. Mods are fully supported without any restrictions.</em></li>
<li><em>PSN connecting is entirely optional and NEVER required.</em></li>
<li><em>Both the PC and PS5 versions offer the same content. We will make sure that early buyers are never at a disadvantage through future updates.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, many PC users are still doubtful&nbsp;<span>about the inclusion of Denuvo in Stellar Blade. In the past, the DRM software was involved in claims that it negatively affected performance, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-7-denuvo-drm-performance-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Tekken 7</a>&nbsp;and, more recently,<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-pc-stutters-go-away-with-the-crack-digital-foundry-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Resident Evil Village</a>. Other times, it turned out that </span>the anti-tamper software <a href="https://wccftech.com/denuvo-drm-doesnt-impact-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was not responsible</a> for any performance decrease.</p>
<p>With only three weeks left before the launch, we won't have to wait long before learning how well Stellar Blade is optimized. The developer has made bold claims, though:</p>
<p><em>After extensive testing and relentless optimization, the game delivers high frame rates on a variety of setups. Even on the Steam Deck, you can reach 45â€“50 FPS with the right settings.</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the game has climbed the best-selling chart on Steam with its pre-orders, making Shift Up very happy. Check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Stellar Blade PS5 review</a> to learn what we thought of the game when it first launched on Sony's console.</p>
