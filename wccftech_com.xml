			<p>Before <strong>Hytale</strong> became the standalone MMO we know it to be today, it began its life as a <strong>Minecraft </strong>mod called <strong>Hypixel</strong>. Since breaking off to become Hytale, with the studio behind it taking the name Hypixel, the MMO has been on a massive journey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">one that <strong>saw the studio get acquired</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">subsequently shut down</a></strong>, only <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/">to be revived again</a></strong>, and as of last week, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">off to a stellar start in early access</a></strong>. Now, the game's latest storybook moment in a long line of storybook moments brings it back to its origins, as some truly impressive modding work adds <strong>crossplay support between Hytale and Minecraft</strong>.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Two separate (though admittedly very similar) games, not the same game on different platforms, but two separate, standalone games, can support crossplay with one another thanks to the work of modder <strong>iamcxv7</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-and-minecraft-get-crossplay-capability-thanks-to-intrepid-modder">IGN</a>, modder iamcxv7 explains their work as just "<em>Packet Trickery,</em>" but that seems to be a humble cover for what is an amazingly impressive feat. Even though the mod itself isn't publicly available yet, and iamcxv7 admits that there's still a lot of work to be done, the fact that they've proven it to be possible is an incredible full-circle, storybook moment for both Hytale and Minecraft.</p>

<p>"<em>It's all just Packet Trickery</em>," explains iamcxv7. "<em>You could say I am running a Minecraft Server in the Hytale JVM which uses the Coordinate System of the Hytale World (As its the same) As well as takes a Snapshot of the Hytale World and reconstructs it and then send it to to the Client via Packets</em>."</p>

<p>It's a Hytale mod, so when it does go live, you won't need to add the mod to Minecraft to play with your friends on Hytale. You'll just add it to Hytale and play alongside your friends in Minecraft that way. It's all still early days for this mod as iamcxv7 admits that they only started working on it earlier this week, but even just as a proof of concept, this is an amazing effort.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Has Lost Nearly 95% of its Value in the Last Eight Years After 34% Share Price Drop due to its “Major Reset”]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced that it would be undergoing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset,"</em></strong> which saw the company <strong>cancel six games, including the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake,</strong></a> delay another <strong>seven unannounced titles</strong>, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">entirely restructuring the company's whole operating model</a>.</p>



<p>To call it a 'major reset' was practically an understatement, as it wasn't just a portfolio reset, but one that will forever change how the French company operates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, its share price didn't take the news well, and, as reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a>, the company's <strong>share price dropped by 34%.</strong></p>



<p>What's worse, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> points out, is that after yesterday's major drop, the company's market cap sits around <strong>€500 million</strong>. Back in 2018, its market cap was closer to <strong>€10 billion</strong>, which means that in just the <strong>last eight years, Ubisoft has lost somewhere in the range of 95% of its value.</strong></p>







<p>At the time of this writing, the company's stock price currently sits at <strong>€4.37</strong>, marking the lowest point for its share price in over a decade, as it hasn't dropped below <strong>€5.00</strong> since 2011. When you look at these historic lows, it's understandable as to why the company's shareholders were calling for the <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf"><strong>Guillemot</strong> <strong>family</strong> to be removed from leadership</a> back in 2024, and why shareholders have reportedly been looking at all options, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">including a buyout</a>, in recent years.</p>



<p>If not for <strong>Tencent</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-raise-its-stake-in-ubisoft-aims-to-become-largest-shareholder/">which has continuously raised its importance</a> within Ubisoft over the last few years, solidifying itself as a core partner for the company with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong> last year</a>, chief executive officer and co-founder <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, and the rest of his founding family might've already found themselves ousted from the company they started all the way back in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while chief financial officer <strong>Frederick Duguet</strong> did not comment on share price expectations, he emphasized that it's what the company does next that's most important, namely how it can execute its plans now that it is undertaking this "<em>major reset</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>What I can repeat is that we want to focus on execution," </em>said Duguet.<em> "It's a major reset and we want to make sure that everything we've decided will allow the Creative Houses to succeed in their specific role. And we want them to be the best in the world in each and every segment we're in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We will be also entering into a few additional segments. We mentioned that we still have four new IPs in development. But again, the market is super selective. We are on a good path to return to very high quality games, as we've seen lately, but we need to go further and we are convinced that when we do it well, then the return on investment can be exceptional. But you need to be in the top two of each and every segment.</em>"</p>
