			<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a>, we got new looks at 16 games. Some of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/godfall-developer-counterplay-games-debuts-armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">were new announcements and reveals</a>, others were first looks at gameplay. The trailer we saw for The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu falls in the latter camp, with our first real look at gameplay for the upcoming four-player online co-op game from ACE Team and Nacon.</p>



<p>First announced <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/nacon-and-ace-team-announce-co-op-horror-game-the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc">back in March 2025</a>, it was initially set to arrive sometime before the end of this year. Then, in August, <a href="https://x.com/PlayTheMound/status/1956353464801321128">Nacon and ACE Team delayed its launch to 2026</a>. Now, have a more defined release window, with the studios announcing that it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S at some point in Summer 2026.</p>



<p>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu puts you into the shoes of one of four players, all stuck on an island, trying to survive a cursed jungle that will warp their reality, making it difficult to tell the difference between allies and enemies.</p>

<p>Not only are you dealing with mind-bending phenomena, you're dealing with an older class of weapons that cause their own anxieties simply due to the fact that if you miss your first shot, you might not get the chance to reload a second with these old-school rifles.</p>



<p>This trailer, short as it is, was our first proper look at gameplay, while still emphasizing the dark atmosphere and tone the game is going for. It'll be interesting to see how ACE Team and Nacon lean into its 16th-century setting and its Lovecraftian inspirations. </p>

			<p>Development of Stellar Blade 2 is ramping up, and new details on the second entry in the series have been revealed today by a new job listing.</p>



<p>As spotted by Genki on X, a new job listing found on developer <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=318&amp;page=1&amp;code=news">Shift Up's official website</a> confirms that their upcoming game will be a multiplatform game, aiming to release on various consoles and PC. This represents a significant change from the original Stellar Blade, as the game is currently available only on PlayStation 5 and PC, although Shift Up confirmed earlier this year that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">it was exploring a release on other platforms, including the Nintendo Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>Unfortunately, the job listing provides little additional information about Stellar Blade 2. According to the job listing, the game will <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"inherit the stylish action and narrative-driven world of its predecessor, while delivering an evolved action gameplay experience,"</em> which is exactly what Shift Up said back in September when it confirmed that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-sequel-development/">the game entered active development.</a></p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up announced the start of large scale recruitment for the development of the Stellar Blade sequel!</p><p>New job listings suggest console and PC multiplatform development using Unreal Engine 5!</p><p>“The next installment of ‘Stella Blade’, currently under development at Shift Up, is… <a href="https://t.co/fcQZedfvKx">pic.twitter.com/fcQZedfvKx</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1991891947116798013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Stellar Blade 2 entering active development a little over a year after the series debuted on PlayStation 5 is hardly surprising. Although the game was the first console and PC game developed by the Korean game development studio, it immediately captured the attention of players worldwide with its recognizable main character, solid action-gameplay and great soundtrack, so much so that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-fastest-selling-korean-game-steam/">became the fastest selling Korean game on Steam</a>, driving nearly 60% of Shift Up's revenue in the second quarter of the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>Though an excellent action game, Stellar Blade is not without issues, as the narrative elements, while acceptable for an action game, weren't particularly remarkable, and never explored in depth the game's universe. Hopefully, Shift Up will tighten them up for the sequel to deliver an even more memorable experience.</p>
