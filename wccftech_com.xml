<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5, and will launch on PC on January 23rd. You can learn more about one of the best games Square Enix has released in years by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>

			<p>OtherSide Entertainment, the studio founded by Warren Spector and Paul Neurath, has unveiled its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warren-spector-is-working-on-an-immersive-sim-based-on-a-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new immersive sim-inspired IP</a> at The Game Awards 2024. It's called Thick As Thieves, and it will be a PvPvE stealth action multiplayer game, which will definitely wrinkle the noses of some classic immersive sim fans since they are used to single player adventures.</p>
<p>However, Warren Spector maintains that the new game sits firmly in the studio's historic immersive sim roots. In a prepared statement, he said:</p>
<p><em>Thick As Thieves captures the vision of immersive gameplay that OtherSide was founded on. With this game, we’re empowering players to create their own stories in a world that values observation, craftiness, and creative problem-solving.</em></p>
<p>Thick As Thieves will be published by Megabit, Aonic's new publishing arm. Benjie Clarke, Managing Director of Global Publishing at Megabit, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>OtherSide Entertainment’s co-founders helped pioneer the stealth action genre with the original Thief and Deus Ex games. Their collaboration at OtherSide has rekindled this vision, now focused on pushing boundaries with fresh perspectives. Thick As Thieves marks the next step for what an immersive action game can accomplish and how sharing this experience with other players leads to incredible player-driven storytelling.</em></p>

<p>Thick As Thieves is set in an alternate history 1910 metropolis where technology meets magic and glittering wealth clashes with a thriving criminal underclass. As the upper class amasses wealth and power while the lower class struggles to survive, players must weave their way through both worlds, using stealth and cunning in their quest for treasure and glory.</p>
<p>Players engage in a unique competitive multiplayer experience where infiltration, theft, and escape are the keys to success. According to the developer, the game rewards cunning tactics, planning, and improvisation. However, every shadow and corner can potentially hide a new challenge - from wary guards to devious rivals to the ever-changing, treacherous city itself, which OtherSide describes as a world full of characters, stories and mysteries. There will also be a personal storyline where the main character shapes their own destiny and journey from nobody to crime legend.</p>
<p>Rising through the ranks will literally open doors, as players get the option to pick locks, hijack alarms, bamboozle guards, silence civilians, and conceal their presence in their never-ending quest to escape with a bag full of loot.</p>
<p>As part of the immersive sim theme, keeping an eye on the city's inhabitants and their daily habits might just help players: maybe the housemaid has talked to her husband, who has talked to the barmaid after a few drinks.</p>
<p>Thick As Thieves will launch in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/underworld-ascendant-underwhelming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">underwhelming launch of Underworld Ascendant</a> and the cancelation of their <a href="https://wccftech.com/system-shock-3-tencent-takes-over-nightdive-owns-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">System Shock 3</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-cancels-at-least-5-games-including-2-dd-titles-from-hidden-path-otherside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">untitled Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a>, it will no doubt be very important for OtherSide's future.</p>
