            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Build a Rocket Boy has debuted a new trailer for its upcoming game, MindsEye, ahead of its release in just a couple of weeks, at the time of writing on<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/"> June 10, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The new trailer is a six-and-a-half-minute 'introduction' to MindsEye, showcasing plenty of details about the game's story, some new looks at gameplay, and digging a bit into the post-launch content and the level-creation tools that are featured in the PC version of the game.</p>
<p>MindsEye's creation tool gives PC players access to the game's assets, and according to the trailer, allows players to create "<em>anything</em>" they can think of, and touts that Build a Rocket Boy is "<em>passionate about democratizing video game development</em>."</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Regarding MindsEye's roadmap, the game will launch with its single-player campaign and several different additional gameplay scenarios, with more to be added later in the year during the summer, fall, and winter. There's also a 'premium pass' that players can purchase that'll provide what Build a Rocket Boy classifies as 'extra' missions, along with each of the planned free updates and cosmetic packs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>We're beyond excited to bring MindsEye to players worldwide,</em>" said Leslie Benzies, former Rockstar producer who worked on the Grand Theft Auto series since GTA III, now founder of Build a Rocket Boy and director of MindsEye, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Our team has poured their passion and dedication into creating MindsEye and the Game Creation System for almost a decade, to deliver players an unforgettable story campaign and empower them to craft their own world-class experiences. Continuous updates and fresh new content from our studio ensure MindsEye is an endless adventure.</em>"</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how players react to MindsEye when it launches. There's pedigree behind the game due to Benzies' history, and everything we've seen in gameplay trailers so far looks incredibly flashy.</p>
<p>But recent previews haven't been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">too high on what was shown</a>, and as recently as this past weekend, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a> reviews from former and current employees are making the rounds on <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1926754035144536233">social media</a> describing Build a Rocket Boy as bad place to work, with some reviews telling developers to "<em>avoid</em>" the studio "<em>at all costs</em>," others call out Benzies directly for his poor management of the studio, and many describe Build a Rocket Boy to be a toxic place to work.</p>
<p>Realistically, Build a Rocket Boy wouldn't be the first, nor would it be the last game studio to have poor internal working conditions and is still able to release an amazing game. So all this concern about the poor previews and bad internal conditions at the studio could be quickly forgotten by players as they're enamored with the next-best-game of 2025. We'll see what happens on June 10.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-%E2%80%98absolution%E2%80%99-is-out-on-june-3.1199463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet announced that the final update for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds expansion</a> will be released on June 3.</p>
<p>Titled 'Absolution', the update follows '<a href="https://wccftech.com/arenanet-to-release-godspawn-update-for-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-on-november-19-featuring-new-50-player-titan-battle-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godspawn</a>' and '<a href="https://wccftech.com/repentance-guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-second-update-is-out-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repentance</a>' to conclude the trio of free updates that the developer had planned for Janthir Wilds. In this patch, players will find additions to game modes, new rewards, and a new map and story. Story-wise, they'll get to experience the robust and action-packed finale for themselves as they discover the ancient secrets at the heart of the Primordial Egress on Tyria’s frontiers.</p>
<p>The crumbling city of Bava Nisos, once a monument to Mursaat glory, lies twisted beneath three centuries of magic. The final descent to the heart of this new explorable zone involves a map-wide meta event that will lead players to the Mists Gate — the focal point of the titan invasion in Janthir. Alongside this new content, a new boss — the titan Ura — will be added to the Convergence game mode, which is designed for groups of up to 50 players.</p>
<p><iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds – &quot;Absolution&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0boXkTbLZ8o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Absolution also adds a new Fractal dungeon (Kinfall) to Guild Wars 2 in which players take on the role of a lowland Kodan and experience events from their cultural past. They will uncover the whispers of the elder dragon Jormag for the first time — an event which preceded their migration from northern Tyria to the Janthir Wilds.</p>
<p>The Homesteads housing feature will also be enhanced: the decoration limit will double from 1,000 to 2,000 objects, enabling players to create denser living spaces, and the Homestead Mastery level will increase to 500, granting access to new crafted decorations. A host of new rewards, including a legendary backpack and glider, new weapon sets, new relics, and updated offerings in the Wizards' Vault, will bring the 2024 expansion cycle to a close.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch to yearly expansions</a>, ArenaNet should announce the next one in the coming weeks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/physint-exists-because-people-kept-asking-kojima-for-a-new-metal-gear-like-game.1199406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/physint-exists-because-people-kept-asking-kojima-for-a-new-metal-gear-like-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In January 2024, legendary game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new partnership with Sony to create Physint, a new tactical espionage game in the vein of Metal Gear. While Kojima's focus is currently on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which launches next month on PlayStation 5, the veteran developer also discussed what drove him to go back to this kind of project.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://pocketmags.com/eu/edge-magazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDGE</a> (issue 411, July 2025), he said that the people's wishes for a new Metal Gear game were important in the decision:</p>
<p><em>Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create. But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That’s when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint. This made me think that these multiplatform projects will help the studio live on – not just through games but in other media too. We’re exploring other forms of entertainment as well, so we are a game company, but not only a game company. This is phase two for Kojima Productions.</em></p>
<p>Kojima had recently talked about Physint in another interview, revealing that fans will have to wait a long time - five to six years - before playing the game. That's likely because after Death Stranding 2: On the Beach the studio will focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OD</a>, the supposedly revolutionary game he's making for Xbox and with the collaboration of Jordan Peele. The game will feature a cast with actors like Sophia Lillis (Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and German actor Udo Kier.</p>
<p>Following the release of Physint, Kojima said that he could finally make a movie, which was his lifelong dream.</p>
