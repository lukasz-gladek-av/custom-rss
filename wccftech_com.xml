			<p>A few hours ago, Remedy Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1938250909865410867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via social media channels that its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak, had surpassed one million players. At the same time, the Finnish developer acknowledged that it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-gets-update-1-2-as-remedy-promises-lots-more-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of work to do</a> to improve the game:</p>
<p><em>As of last night, we have surpassed 1 million players in FBC: Firebreak. This is a significant milestone, so thank you for playing from all of us at Remedy. We know there is still a lot of work ahead of us, and we are super-motivated about it. We have a lot of exciting things cooking for Firebreak players! More about that soon.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the game may have reached one million players, but that's not saying too much since it has been available on the two primary subscription services, Sony's PlayStation Plus and Microsoft's Game Pass, since day one.</p>
<p>On Steam, the FBC: Firebreak peaked at 1,992 players ten days ago, but it's been getting lower and lower. Yesterday, the daily peak was 169 players. At the time of writing, there are 78 players playing the game via Valve's platform. User reviews are 'Mixed', too, with just 67% leaving a positive review.</p>
<p>Now, it is definitely a little early to sound the requiem for the game. We've seen several online games starting badly and managing to claw back their way to a decent, active user base. The reverse is also true, with some games starting off strong and then dying down like a flame.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any live service game lives or dies depending on the developer's ability to gather feedback, analyze it, and implement it properly. We'll see in the next few months how well Remedy fares in this regard, where so many developers have stumbled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can read our full review of FBC: Firebreak <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, penned by Francesco De Meo.</p>

			<p>Swedish game developer Fatshark <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-gets-new-arbites-class-via-dlc-and-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first paid DLC for Warhammer 40K Darktide earlier this week, adding the Adeptus Arbites class. Today, the studio has proudly shared that the launch has been successful. Martin Wahlund, CEO and Co-Founder of Fatshark, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We more than doubled our estimated player goals on launch day alone. Thank you for making this launch one to remember!</em></p>
<p>The team also shared some fun stats. The Cyber-Mastiff companion has been petted more than 459,760 times as a reward for being a very good boy. Users have already killed 553,082,097 enemies with an Adeptus Arbites character. Their most used melee weapon so far is the Mk III Branx Pattern Arbites Shock Maul, used 969,008 times, while the most used ranged weapon is the Mk III Executioner Pattern Arbites Shotgun, used 1,157,103 times. The players' favorite ability is Break The Line, which was activated 715,525 times.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Darktide players can purchase the Arbites DLC for $11.99, although there's also a Deluxe Edition available at $18.99. This version includes a unique class outfit, a unique companion outfit, a portrait frame (this one can be equipped by characters of all classes), and four weapon skins.</p>
<p>Alongside the DLC, Fatshark also released a free update that introduced a more structured narrative path to ease new players into the game. The mission board system was revamped, too, increasing the number of mission options for all characters. The patch also increased the maximum number of Operatives to eight, as was the maximum number of weapon loadouts. Fatshark also added around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, Darktide was not the only Warhammer 40K game to launch new content focused on the Adeptus Arbites. Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG also just released the Lex Imperialis expansion, introducing this very class of enforcers of the Emperor's justice, including a new companion, Solomorne Anthar.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnl-EMxfYE">Capcom's Spotlight Showcase 2025</a> event featured several of the games in the studio's portfolio, but it spent more time showing off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> latest free title update than it did anything else.</p>
<p>The second free title update for Monster Hunter Wilds will be available on <strong>Monday, June 30, 2025</strong>, adding two monsters to the hunt. The long-awaited Lagiacrus, and Seregios, from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.</p>
<p>Capcom also revealed a roadmap for more updates coming later this year, with a seasonal event coming in July that'll last from July 23 to August 6, and a Arch-tempered monster, Uth Duna, that gets introduced on July 30 with its own equipment rewards and challenge questline. That'll run until August 20.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>On August 27, a Fender collaboration will arrive, letting players shred in between hunts, which will land just ahead of the third free title update, which is due to arrive sometime in&nbsp;<strong>late September 2025.</strong></p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched at the end of February 2025 and was instantly one of the best-selling games of 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/">setting records for Capcom</a>. It's also arguably one of the best games in the Monster Hunter series, if not the best one so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">When Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed it</a>, he said that Monster Hunter Wilds is "<em>the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series.</em>"</p>
<p>If you've been wanting to jump into Monster Hunter Wilds, but haven't had the chance yet, it's on sale for the first time this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/">as part of the Steam Summer Sale 2025</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/capcom-dives-into-pragmata-gameplay-which-players-will-get-to-try-at-gamescom-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-dives-into-pragmata-gameplay-which-players-will-get-to-try-at-gamescom-2025.1229655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom's Spotlight Showcase 2025 event started off with a deep dive into <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">Pragmata</a>, showing off more of its hacking-shooting-puzzle gameplay and talking a little more in-depth about the story between the android girl Diana and Hugh Williams, an astronaut who ends up on the Moon as part of an investigative team trying to discover why this lunar base has gone silent.</p>
<p>Williams is described as a sometimes sarcastic, though kind man, while Diana is "<em>an android with a heart</em>" and a "<em>curious and enigmatic android</em>."</p>
<p>The combat system works in two parts. First, you'll always need Diana to 'hack' your enemy's armor, otherwise you won't do any damage. Once you've completed the short puzzle of connecting two green nodes on a five-by-five square while passing through as many blue nodes as you can, Hugh is then able to engage in the ranged third-person combat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capcom Spotlight | 6.26.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Every encounter in Pragmata is essentially a race at the beginning, with you trying to complete the puzzle before the enemy is able to slowly walk to you and do damage, while you try to finish the puzzle to stun them briefly and gain the upper hand. Once you're dealing with multiple enemies at a time, it's about managing who to take down first and how to keep them from overwhelming you quickly.</p>
<p>Graciously, you do also seem to have a solid maneuverability move set, with thrusters that are helpful in combat and when platforming around the lunar station.</p>
<p>We still don't have a proper release date for Pragmata, as the game is still set to release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC,<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/"> sometime in 2026</a>. Capcom did however confirm that players will be able to try the game themselves if they're in attendance at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto got to try out Pragmata at this year's<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/"> Summer Game Fest 2025 event</a>, and though it was just a short demo, Kai was already able to see the potential of the game's combat.</p>
<p>"<em>In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core.</em>"</p>
