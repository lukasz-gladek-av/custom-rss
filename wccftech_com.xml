			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2025 early access debut on PC</a>, <strong>Riot</strong> is preparing to launch the fighting game <strong>2XKO</strong> as a full release on both PC and consoles. An announcement trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BVTEIoD_S0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was published a few hours ago on YouTube</a> by Riot but quickly went private, which means someone posted it beforehand. Still, even though it technically counts as a 'leak', it's the kind where the official source self-leaks the news in advance, and so can be considered accurate.</p>



<p>2XKO has been a long time coming. It all started after Radiant Entertainment, the studio that made <strong>Rising Thunder</strong> (as well as the city builder Stonehearth), was acquired by Riot in 2016. While that meant the cancellation of Rising Thunder, the founders, the <strong>Cannon brothers</strong>, quickly started working on a new fighting game under Riot.</p>



<p>That wasn't very surprising. Despite Stonehearth, the Cannon brothers were always more interested in fighting games than anything else; after all, they founded the <strong>Evolution Championship Series</strong> and also developed the <strong>GGPO</strong> middleware, which provided the <strong>rollback netcode technology</strong> now practically mandatory for any self-respecting fighting game with online functionality.</p>



<p>It took many years to get this new project running, though. The first confirmation that they were indeed working on a new fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-rising-thunder-devs-are-indeed-working-on-a-fighting-game-at-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in August 2019</a>, but it wasn't until August 2022 that fans got another major update, when the developers<a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-fighting-game-project-l-goes-free-to-play-new-fighter-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealed</a> that it would be a free-to-play title. The game's title, 2XKO, was only announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in February 2024</a>. That's also when we learned the first actual details on the game, which is a 2v2 tag-team fighting game where players select two characters from Riot's League of Legends setting. </p>

<p>One champion starts as the "Point," while the other starts as the "Assist." Players can tag in and out to swap active fighters, creating a four-player arena. Active tagging lets you call in assists mid-combo to extend damage or set up mix-ups. Furthermore, tag-in timing is crucial to offensive flow.</p>



<p>In an attempt to improve accessibility to those who aren't well-versed in the genre, there are no traditional quarter-circle or dragon-punch motions in 2XKO; instead, champions use button combinations. Another key feature of the game is the Fuse system, a team-building customization mechanic (similar to League keystones) that grants abilities like back-to-back assist calling, increased damage at health advantage, or dual ultimates, allowing users to customize duo synergies and playstyles.</p>

After months of updates, the popular <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">FromSoftware</strong> hardcore action RPG is now <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fully playable</strong> thanks to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ShadPS4 emulator</strong>, even on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dated hardware</strong></a> and handheld systems like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-version-0-12-6-massive-performance-boost-bloodborne/">Steam Deck</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Emulation, however, still isn't perfect, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">online features</strong> are not accessible - but that may be about to change. A new video shared on YouTube by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gmoralistube">George Moralis</a></strong>, one of the emulator's lead developers, shows <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloodborne</em> running on PC with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">online features enabled</strong>.</p>



<p>While this is an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">early technical test</strong>, and many issues still need to be ironed out, it's hard not to get excited about the prospect of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">co-op play</strong>, searching <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">glyph Chalice Dungeons</strong>, and accessing the asynchronous features such as messages and bloodstains that make FromSoftware's titles so unique.

</p></figure>



<p>As for how <em>Bloodborne's</em> online features will function in future versions of <strong>ShadPS4</strong>, it is too early to say. According to George Moralis, the development team is <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oqkDeWhV5g&amp;lc=Ugx0oiPx3VLoeDEw0VB4AaABAg.ARJJ8ekVjhrARJN3dkWPbQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examining several options</a></strong>, including <strong>dedicated community servers</strong> or <strong>local servers</strong>. One thing, however, is certain: users playing on the emulated version will <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oqkDeWhV5g&amp;lc=UgzvNpnDQCtzxPeQ-fd4AaABAg.ARJM4Pn3JqpARJMu_zF1QS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never be able to connect to Sony's official servers</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Besides perfecting <em>Bloodborne's</em> emulation, the <strong>ShadPS4 development team</strong> is continuing to expand the list of <strong>PlayStation 4 exclusives</strong> playable on PC. More information on the emulator's progress can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/"><strong>official website</strong>.</a></p>
