			<p>The news that <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has surpassed the total </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/" target="_blank">number of&nbsp;<strong>Game of the Year</strong>&nbsp;<strong>awards</strong></a>&nbsp;won by the previous record holder, FromSoftware's Elden Ring (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with our very own awards marking the historical occurrence</a></strong>), has circulated widely on the Web over</span> the past few days. </p>



<p>Industry veteran <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>, whom <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we recently interviewed about the state of the MMORPG industry in Western countries</a></strong>, shared his thoughts on the event <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rich-vogel-093425_i-am-very-happy-that-expedition-has-been-activity-7419821314288410624-rTqW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a>. Vogel feels that Expedition 33 is a 'really good game', but also <strong>can't quite wrap his head around it being 'better' than Elden Ring</strong>, which he praised for its brilliant open world design.</p>



<p><em>I am very happy that Expedition has been honored with so many awards. It is a really good game. It is hard for me to accept that Expedition 33 is a better game than Elden Ring. I had more fun playing Elden Ring. The open-world design was brilliant. I like that it did not force you down paths like Skyrim and gave you the freedom to go anywhere in the world. You started out being hunted and became the hunter.</em></p>



<p>Another industry veteran who was part of the aforementioned Wccftech interview on MMOs, <strong>Greg Street</strong>, also replied that Elden Ring is much more replayable. Street <strong>called Expedition 33 a masterpiece</strong> but also noted that the game's emotional story makes people more forgiving of other faults, such as the level design.</p>



<p><em>I imagine I will play Expedition 33 once or twice more in my lifetime, which is typical for single player RPGs for me. I predict I will go back to Elden Ring ten times or more. The replayability potential between the two is hard to compare. I think 33 is a masterpiece for sure, but I think people’s love for the story and characters leads them to overly forgive other places where the game is weaker, such as level design.</em></p>



<p>Of course, the fact that Sandfall's acclaimed turn-based JRPG has earned more Game of the Year awards (436 versus 435, though Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 still has several prizes left to claim) than Elden Ring <strong>does not mean it is objectively 'better'</strong>. For one thing, FromSoftware's game arguably had stronger competition, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarök</a></strong> taking its own share of GOTY awards that year. </p>

			<p>It seems the news around <strong>Ubisoft</strong> is not stopping anytime soon, as a statement sent to Wccftech (first spotted on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-redundancy-process-to-cut-200-jobs-from-paris-head-office">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) reveals that the company has kicked off a <strong>"<em>voluntary</em>" layoff program</strong> at its <strong>Ubisoft Paris</strong> headquarters, where it intends to cut as many as <strong>200 employees</strong> from the studio.</p>



<p>This follows after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">announced it would undergo a <strong>"<em>major reset</em>"</strong> last week</a>, which saw the entire company get restructured into five different 'Creative Houses,' multiple projects getting delayed or outright cancelled, and caused the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">company's share price to drop to its lowest point since <strong>2011</strong></a>. Now, after a report directly regarding how <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">morale within Ubisoft and specifically at Ubisoft Paris is led by <strong>"<em>anger and despair,"</em></strong></a> we've learned that things are getting worse for employees at the Paris HQ.</p>



<p>It should be noted that, due to this being a voluntary program that will cut as many as 200 employees, it's possible that fewer than 200 positions will be made redundant by the program's completion. The statement confirms that this program <strong>only applies</strong> to employees under Ubisoft International with French contracts, and that no cuts will be made final until an agreement is reached with union representatives and validated by French authorities.</p>



<p>"<em>In line with last week’s announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction&nbsp;initiatives, Ubisoft International (HQ' legal entity) has initiated discussions&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;a potential Rupture&nbsp;Conventionnelle&nbsp;Collective (RCC), <strong>a collective, voluntary mutual&nbsp;termination&nbsp;agreement</strong> that could involve&nbsp;around&nbsp;200 positions at its headquarters in France</em>," the statement reads.</p>



<p>"<em>At this stage, this&nbsp;remains&nbsp;a proposal&nbsp;and will require&nbsp;a collective agreement with&nbsp;unions&nbsp;and validation&nbsp;by French authorities&nbsp;to come into effect.</em> <em>The&nbsp;proposal&nbsp;applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide.</em>"</p>



<p>These cuts are part of the layoffs we were told to expect after Ubisoft made it clear that part of its restructure under this "<em>major reset</em>" would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">further cost reduction to the tune of <strong>€200</strong> <strong>million</strong></a> and a return-to-office mandate, two elements that led to a strike taking place outside of Ubisoft Paris this past Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>It's clear this is not the end of Ubisoft's woes, but only the beginning of a new chapter of bad news for Ubisoft. Last week, ahead of the strike, French video game union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong>, which represents several Ubisoft Paris employees, specifically called out Ubisoft chief executive officer,<strong> Yves Guillemot</strong>, for the company's current issues.</p>



<p>"<em>It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions. Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games</em>."</p>



<p>As one of the co-founders, along with his brothers, Yves Guillemot and his family have led Ubisoft since its inception. In the last eight years, with Yves at the helm, Ubisoft lost <strong>95% of its total value</strong>, going from a valuation of <strong>$10 billion</strong> to just <strong>$500 million</strong> as of last week.</p>
