			<p>The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/">Variety</a>.</p>



<p>This is the same series that was announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/">May 2024</a> with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe </a>that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,</em>" Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "<em>It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…</em>"</p>



<p>For Turner's part, she added that she is "<em>thrilled beyond measure</em>" to be stepping into the role. "<em>She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking.</em>"</p>



<p>It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected/">confirmed layoffs last week</a>, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "<em>unaffected</em>," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Comes to PS4 Next Week Alongside Season 4 Launch]]></title>

			<p>Marvel Rivals is currently only available on the current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, but as of next week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-marvel-go-ahead-to-make-original-marve-rivals-characters-director-says-stay-tuned/">NetEase</a> has announced that it'll drop onto last-gen consoles with its arrival on PS4 alongside the release of the game's Season 4: The Heart of the Dragon on September 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The confirmation comes with a new cinematic trailer for Season 4, which lists the PS4 alongside the rest of its platforms at the end of the trailer. Unfortunately for Xbox One players, they're currently left out of the fun, though that could change with a similarly surprising announcement in a future Marvel Rivals update. </p>

<p>Marvel Rivals has been one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">most popular games this year</a> after its arrival in December 2024, and its arrival on PS4 could potentially see another peak to its popularity that just wasn't possible on current-gen only consoles, especially when considering the fact that it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nearly-five-years-into-the-ps5-generation-there-are-more-players-on-ps5-monthly-than-ps4-sony-confirms/">only this past June</a> when Sony was able to confirm that there were more PS5 players active on a monthly basis than PS4 players. Even major games like Genshin Impact are <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">only starting to wind down their PS4 support now</a>.</p>



<p>The PS4 may be a last-gen console, but there are still millions of players who, for one reason or another, have not yet upgraded to a PS5 or Xbox Series console and jumped into the current-gen. </p>
