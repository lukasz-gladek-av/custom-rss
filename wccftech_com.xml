			<p>During the Warhammer Skulls 2025 livestream, Owlcat Games announced its next cRPG project: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>. As you can guess from the title, it's not a direct sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a> and will instead focus on the Inquisition.</p>
<p>Players will begin their journey as an acolyte of the Inquisition, their duty to investigate heresy, command a diverse warband, and influence the destiny of the Calixis Sector. The studio promises an immersive narrative experience where every decision carries weight and the Inquisition is portrayed in-depth, with its power, bureaucracy, and inner conflicts laid bare like never before.</p>
<p>As an Inquisitor, the players' primary goal is to protect the Imperium from the taint of Xenos, the betrayal of heretics, and the scourge of mutants by any means necessary. During the game, they'll explore the mysteries of the Tyrant Star and overcome the worst horrors of the Noctis Aeterna.</p>

<p>As in any good cRPG previously released by Owlcat, Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy will also offer players aid in the form of companions with different expertise and backgrounds. These companions range from loyal Imperial subjects (such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catacha) to nefarious Xenos, including an avian-like Kroot mercenary. Each one features distinctive gameplay and a new perspective on the story with fully voiced dialogues. The game doesn't have a release date yet, but it can already be wishlisted on Steam.</p>
<p>During the same Warhammer Skulls live stream, Owlcat also unveiled Lex Imperialis, the second big expansion coming to Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader after <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-traders-first-expansion-void-shadows-moved-to-september-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Void Shadows</a>. In Lex Imperials, players will find a new 15-hour storyline that introduces the Adeptus Arbites, a faction of incorruptible enforcers, and a new companion—the grim and relentless Solomorne Antha. The expansion is out on all platforms on June 24.</p>

<p>Lastly, Owlcat announced a second Season Pass for Rogue Trader, which will provide access to two additional expansions coming in the future. The third expansion will allow players to enter a Necron vault curated by the iconic Trazyn the Infinite, where they will challenge ancient guardians and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy. The fourth DLC will let players explore the Processional of the Damned, a surreal graveyard of voidships, descending into madness and mystery. Like the prior DLCs, these freshly announced expansions will introduce a new companion character, new quests deeply integrated into the main storyline, and new mechanics, delivering around 15 hours of gameplay. To celebrate all the news, the base game is discounted on all platforms.</p>

			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages had a big launch in terms of player numbers compared to DOOM Eternal. The Dark Ages reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-reaches-3-million-players-7x-faster-than-eternal/">three million players in just five days</a>, which was seven times faster than Eternal.</p>
<p>Three million players in five days is by no means a disappointment, though the majority of those players, as was expected, were Xbox players who either bought the game or were playing it through Xbox Game Pass on their Series X/S consoles or Game Pass PC. According to analytics firm Ampere Analysis (via <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-answer-to-the-video-game-industrys">The Game Business</a>), more than&nbsp;<strong>two million </strong>of those three million launch players were playing on Xbox, while only <strong>500K</strong> were playing on PS5. The Game Business also adds that per Ampere's data, player numbers on PC were, by their definition, "<em>a bit on the low side</em>."</p>
<p>Again, three million is not a bad result by any means, and with Game Pass being Xbox's main pitch to players, it's doubtful (to say the least) that Microsoft is upset at the fact that one game on its service had more than 2 million players on its platform.</p>
<p>We're also still waiting to hear what the initial sales reports are for DOOM: The Dark Ages from firms like Circana and Newzoo, but as The Game Business points out, this modern era of subscription services makes it worth asking if hitting three million players is even "<em>good</em>" in today's landscape. Because, as Raccoon Logic's creative director on <a href="https://wccftech.com/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-surpasses-1-million-players/">Revenge of the Savage Planet recently lamented</a>, high player counts at launch don't exactly translate to high sales when your game is part of a larger subscription service.</p>
<p>The Game Business also points to another recent Game Pass launch, Atomfall, which surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/">1.5 million</a> players in its opening weekend, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-blows-past-2-million-players-in-first-month/"> 2 million players</a> in its opening month. In that case, The Game Business reports that most players played Atomfall on Xbox.</p>
<p>So, while 3 million players in just five days is undeniably a successful result, it can't help but feel like the real test for DOOM: The Dark Ages' success will be how many subscriptions it helps bring over to Xbox Game Pass, and how many units it can sell on non-Xbox platforms.</p>
