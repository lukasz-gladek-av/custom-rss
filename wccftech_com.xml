			<p>Following the launch of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/"><em>Steam Deck</em></a></strong> a few years back, which effectively created a brand new market for handheld gaming devices, <strong>Valve</strong> will <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">launch the <em>Steam Machine</em> this year</a></strong> to further bridge the gap between gaming <strong>PCs</strong> and consoles in the living room.</p>

<p>Speaking with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve">Game</a></em></strong><strong><em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve"> </a></em></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve">Developer</a></em></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Valve</strong> designer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lawrence Yang</strong> revealed that developers can expect <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"fewer constraints"</em> for receiving a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine Verified</em></strong> badge for their games than <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Deck Verification</em></strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"One easy rule of thumb is that if your title is Verified on Steam Deck, it will be Verified on Steam Machine,"</em> Yang said.</p>



<p>On the other hand, developers looking for a Steam Frame Verified badge may have to face a stricter verification process, although <strong>Valve</strong> will <em>"be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback,"</em> <strong>Yang</strong> specified.</p>



<p>The <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It Just Works"</em> philosophy behind the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine</em></strong> has also been extended to another new piece of hardware launching this year, the new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Controller Puck,</em></strong> which can charge and pair a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam controller</em></strong> to any <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC</strong>.

<p><strong>A More Accessible Steam Machine Verified Badge Shouldn't Surprise Anyone</strong></p>



<p>Although <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Valve's</strong>&nbsp;setting of more relaxed conditions for a&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine Verified</strong></em>&nbsp;badge may be fueled by understandable marketing reasons, there are likely other reasons why game developers will have an easier time demonstrating that</span> their games are fully compatible with the upcoming systems</p>



<p>The system's specifications <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">meet the recommended requirements of most current games, enabling solid&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1080p</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1440p</strong>&nbsp;resolution gaming. They also roughly match</span> the most common hardware used by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam</em></strong> users as of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">December 2025 Steam Hardware Survey</em></strong>, set to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/"><strong>better or equal performance than 70% of gaming PCs</strong></a>, with only the system's GPU slightly lagging behind the most common choice, the RTX 3060.</p>



<p>As developers likely won't have <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">to optimize their games specifically for the Steam Machine as they have to for the now-dated&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Deck</strong></em>&nbsp;hardware</span>, it stands to reason it will just be easier for developers to get a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine Verified</em></strong> badge if their games don't have massively high hardware requirements and have no trouble running on SteamOS.</p>
