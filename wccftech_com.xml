			<p><strong>CI Games</strong> is getting ready to release its third <strong>Lords of the Fallen</strong> game with <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, sometime later this year, which we last got a look at during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong> with a new gameplay trailer. Outside of CI Games' chief executive officer, <strong>Marek Tyminski</strong>, promising that this <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-wont-be-politically-correct-will-feature-attractive-females-skimpy-armors/">fantasy action game won't be "<em>politically correct</em>"</a> and that it will feature female characters in revealing armour, in a new developer deep-dive, game director <strong>James Lowe</strong> promises that the combat will be <strong><em>"bolder, braver, bloodier</em>."</strong></p>



<p>A quick rundown on the series, if you're confused as to why the game with the '2' at the end of it is actually the third in the franchise. In 2014, CI Games released <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265300/Lords_Of_The_Fallen_2014/">Lords of the Fallen</a>,</strong> an action RPG that failed to really make a big splash. Almost a decade later, the studio decided to reboot the series and released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/"><strong>Lords of the Fallen (2023)</strong></a>, which, despite its myriad of issues at launch, fared far better. The game's commercial success was enough to drive CI Games to make a sequel, which brings us to Lords of the Fallen 2, due out sometime in 2026, not to be confused with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/"><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2.0</strong></a>, which refers to the massive overhaul update CI Games put out almost two years after the 2023 reboot to fix it.</p>



<p>Getting back to today's combat deep-dive, as part of the studio's Lifting the Veil series on its official YouTube channel, CI Games put out a nearly 42-minute video discussing and showcasing how it is improving and updating combat in Lords of the Fallen 2, trying to address players' concerns from its predecessor while also introducing new elements for the sequel.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Some of the highlights about combat that Lowe discusses alongside lead systems designer <strong>Daniel Regan</strong>, producer <strong>Alex Harkin</strong>, and creative strategist <strong>Ryan Hill</strong> include how the team is doubling down on things players loved from the 2023 reboot, like dual-wielding, a great emphasis on players' speed and maneuverability, and a slew of new animations to make combat feel more varied than it did in 2023.</p>



<p>It's not just a greater variety in animations, but in weapon choices, as CI Games is focusing on letting players swap seamlessly between melee attacks to spell casting and back, while also trying out the barrage of new weapons.</p>



<p>The panel discussion is altogether an honest conversation about how the studio is trying to improve and fix the mistakes it made in previous entries. It's clear that CI Games wants to make this game hit in a way that its previous games never did, which is ultimately an exciting proposition for anyone looking forward to checking out this upcoming action RPG.</p>



<p>Another point that Lowe references in the panel is wanting to "<em>respect the player's time</em>," which was something that he told Wccftech that he and the team wanted to focus on back in December 2025, when we got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/respect-the-players-time-lords-of-the-fallen-ii-game-director-james-lowe-discusses-key-principles-defining-the-game-interview/">sit down with him for an interview</a> following its gameplay showcase at The Game Awards. </p>

			<p><strong>Hello Games</strong> has just released <strong>Remnant</strong>, another free update for <strong>No Man's Sky</strong>. The patch (6.2) introduces gravity manipulation mechanics, extensive vehicle customization, and industrial waste processing facilities.</p>



<p>The headline feature of Remnant is arguably the <strong>Gravitino Coi</strong>l, a new Multi-Tool upgrade <strong>that fundamentally changes how players interact with the game world</strong>. This device allows travelers to magnetize, carry, and launch objects, creating entirely new gameplay possibilities through physics manipulation.</p>



<p><strong>No Man's Sky players are now able to grab and fling various items scattered across planets</strong>, including golden artifacts discovered in planetary ruins. However, the developers believe the tool's most creative application is actually in combat, where <strong>it enables players to capture and throw Sentinel Drones</strong>, effectively turning enemies into projectile weapons against each other, which sounds very fun indeed. Additionally, combat supplies dropped by defeated enemies can now be consumed directly, and the Gravitino Coil interacts with Sphere Creator objects that players have placed in their bases.</p>



<p>The patch introduces <strong>extensive customization options to the off-road Colossus vehicle</strong>. Players can now equip custom modules and technologies, including superelastic wheels, tracked treads, and specialized off-road gear designed to handle any terrain type. Visual customization has also expanded with new paint finishes that can be layered alongside traditional color choices. However, <strong>the most striking addition is the Mechanical Legs upgrade: arachnid-like spider legs that provide hydraulic crawling</strong>. No Man's Sky players can earn the Mechanical Legs by completing the new Remnant expedition, which <strong>features a cross-country hauling experience</strong> where players register for waste transportation missions. </p>



<p><strong>New industrial facilities have appeared in scrap worlds</strong>, offering players the opportunity to extract materials and earn rewards by collecting waste. The system revolves around gathering radioactive crates, explosive canisters, and toxic barrels, though all of them require careful handling due to their hazardous nature. Specialized processing units enable the safe containment and disposal of these dangerous materials, turning environmental cleanup into a potentially profitable venture. </p>



<p>Beyond gameplay additions, cloud rendering has seen significant technical improvements, including enhanced lighting, improved edge stability, and performance optimizations. These changes are particularly noticeable during dawn and dusk sequences.</p>

<p>Hello Games is very excited about what's coming this year, especially since <strong>it marks the tenth anniversary of No Man's Sky's original launch</strong>. The game stumbled at first, as we all know, but recovered miraculously well. At this point, every update (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-adds-expedition-encourages-players-spacewalk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they come in every two to three months</a>) is just gravy.</p>

			<p>For the second year in a row, <strong>Xbox</strong> has revealed the games awarded with its signature stamp of excellence in the <strong>Xbox Excellence Awards</strong>. The awards list 20 titles in four categories, though several of them are repeats, which means only <strong>55</strong> individual titles have made the cut this year. Of those 55, included are titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>, Battlefield 6, Helldivers 2, </strong>and <strong>Hollow Knight Silksong,</strong> all of which made the cut as some of the best-selling games on the Xbox platform in 2025.</p>



<p>The games are listed alphabetically in the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/11/xbox-excellence-awards-2025/">Xbox Wire post</a> announcing the winners, so we don't know which title actually ranked first in any of the categories, which are: Store Rating, Player Engagement, Daily Active Users, and Units Sold.</p>



<p>Interestingly, no individual title made it in all four categories. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></strong> and <strong>Borderlands 4</strong> were the only titles to make three out of four lists, with any other repeats only making it on two out of four lists. While Borderlands 4 missed out on the Store Rating list, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 missed out on the Player Engagement list.</p>



<p>On the Units Sold list, other notable inclusions besides the aforementioned titles are Borderlands 4, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-iceborne-sunbreak-sized-expansion-summer-2026-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</strong> You can check out the full chart below.</p>
