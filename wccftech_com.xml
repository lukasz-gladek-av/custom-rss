			<p>Half-Life 3 fans were not nearly sated by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware announcements Valve made last week</a> (the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, all due sometime early next year). They believed before those announcements and their faith was renewed when several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> to the game's existence and potential imminent launch. Now, though, more sources have added fuel to the hype, just as the franchise celebrates the 27th anniversary since the release of the original Half-Life.</p>



<ul>
<li>Insider Nate the Hate, who has a solid track record, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990879872751735291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> that his sources also spoke about Half-Life 3. However, he received some conflicting information on the announcement timing; one of the things he heard was that it was going to happen at noon yesterday, which obviously wasn't the case.</li>



<li>Shpeshal_Nick, who has a slightly more checkered track record, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1990890439633682499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>: <em>Last week I got a DM that Valve was showing off hardware “this week” (last week) and software “next week” (this week). This software was allegedly Half-Life 3.</em></li>



<li>The Verge journalist Sean Hollister was among those invited to Valve's headquarters for the aforementioned hardware announcements. In a brief story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the website</a>, he noted that the developer's halls were strangely filled with security guards, which never happened on his previous visits. The story also included a picture of a Steam Machine visually customized with several memes, including a title that starts with H and is 'censored'. Fans took it as a tease from Valve that soon, it might not be censored anymore, at long last.</li>
</ul>



<p>Traces of a game project codenamed HLX were discovered through extensive data mining and references across Source 2 engine updates. Tyler McVicker alleged <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as early as this past May</a> that the project believed to be Half-Life 3 was almost at the end of its development. </p>



<p>Needless to say, an announcement on the anniversary of the debut installment in the franchise would make a lot of sense. Besides, Valve unveiled its upcoming hardware exactly a week ago, so if they did want to space their news evenly, today would be the day for the next announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has proudly announced that its latest new release, the city building strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, has registered a record launch for the franchise. There have been seven Anno installments released throughout 25 years, but none captivated the audience as much as the title that launched last week.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft Mainz (previously known as Blue Byte), Anno 117: Pax Romana secured the second spot on last week's Steam chart, beating even Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which launched only a day later. You don't have to take the publisher's word for it, as SteamDB <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1990789664811172057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the news with the following Steam Top 5 chart for the week between November 11 and 18:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6 </li>



<li>Steam Deck</li>
</ul>



<p>Granted, Black Ops 7 famously delivered its own records, albeit negative, when it comes to the Call of Duty franchise. On Steam, the game only reached a concurrent player peak of around 100K users, whereas Black Ops 6 peaked at 315K when it launched last year.</p>



<p>That has, however, little to do with Anno 117: Pax Romana, whose developers are right to celebrate. Even critical acclaim is unprecedented so far, with a Metacritic average of 85 and 94% of OpenCritic reviews recommending the game. Perhaps the most important data point is that users are playing it a lot: the average daily playtime is 3,7 hours.</p>

<p>Stéphane Jankowski, Executive Producer on Anno, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana officially sets sail, marking a new chapter for our beloved franchise and for everyone who poured their passion, creativity, and countless hours into it. We are humbled by the incredible response from our player. Our team remains dedicated, continuously listening to feedback and striving to deliver the ambitious Year 1 content expanding our game world to the province of Egypt!</em></p>
