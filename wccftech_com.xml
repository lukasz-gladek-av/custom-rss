            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-not-support-vrr-when-docked-after-all/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be available for pre-order in the United States on <strong>April 24, 2025</strong>. The console's price, including the bundle with Mario Kart World, Mario Kart World separately, and Donkey Kong Bananza, will stay the same.</p>
<p>Accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2, however, have increased in price. Nintendo announced the new pre-order date and the price adjustments in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/?srsltid=AfmBOoqyV2Xd4TTCZZtccGTsaDJIsgDY1VOZA6jdYT32aCRnPLqexD_s">blog post</a> on its website, citing "<em>changes in market conditions</em>" as the reason for the pricing increase.</p>
<p>Nintendo continued, "<em>Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future, depending on market conditions.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>We apologize for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing. We thank our customers for their patience, and we share their excitement to experience Nintendo Switch 2 starting June 5, 2025.</em>"</p>
<p>While everything else has stayed the same, Nintendo-made accessories for the Switch 2 that were announced on April 2 with the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct have all gone up in price. These are all the accessories Nintendo confirmed are getting a price increase, with the new prices (in US dollars) in bold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - was $79.99, <strong>now</strong> <strong>$84.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera - was $49.99, <strong>now $54.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair - was $89.99, <strong>now</strong> <strong>$94.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip - was $34.99,&nbsp;<strong>now</strong> <strong>$39.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Strap - was $12.99, <strong>now $13.99</strong></li>
<li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair - was $19.99, <strong>now $24.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set - was $109.99, <strong>now $119.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector - was $34.99, <strong>now $39.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case - was $79.99, <strong>now $84.99</strong></li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter - was $29.99, <strong>now $34.99</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>None of these price increases is a major jump, with the biggest being a $10 increase on the Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set, but they still add a bit of sting to an already expensive console. Not to mention the fact that the threat of the console's price going up still looms with the tariffs not yet settled.</p>
<p>After pre-orders were <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">delayed in the US</a> just two days after the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct due to the tariffs announced the same day, there was a lot of confusion and concern that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">the console's price would increase</a>. Many even wondered if the console would come to North America on its June 5 release date.</p>
<p>Pre-orders were also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">delayed in Canada</a> following the announcement that they would be delayed in the US. Pre-orders will also begin in Canada on April 24, 2025. Which is also just a day off from when reliable inside <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-april-23/">billbil-kun predicted</a> they would return.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-to-feature-all-dlc-released-for-the-original-game-%E2%80%93-rumor.1167762/</guid>

			<p>The yet-to-be-announced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is setting out to be the true definitive edition of the classic role-playing game by Bethesda, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k1gyxd/lord_cognito_of_defining_duke_podcast_i_have_it/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, Lord Cognito, who has proven reliable in the past, revealed on the latest episode of the Defining Duke podcast, which has yet to be made available publicly, that all the DLC packs released for the original game will be included in Oblivion Remastered. This is definitely great news if true, considering their high quality.</p>
<p>Rumored to be in the works by Virtuos for a very long time, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was essentially confirmed to be real <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">earlier this week</a> with a bunch of screenshots that leaked via the developer's official website. While details remain scarce as of now, there's a very high chance it won't be long before players will be able to experience this highly anticipated remaster themselves, as multiple insiders have suggested that it will be released sometime <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">next week.</a></p>
<p>With details being scarce, we have no idea what Oblivion Remastered will offer, besides the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-restored-screenshots/">improved visuals</a> powered by Unreal Engine 5. According to a report from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">earlier this year</a>, the remaster will also sport plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">gameplay tweaks</a>, which should improve the experience considerably.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Definitive Edition has become more immersive than ever before this week, thanks to a new VR mod that's now available for download.</p>
<p>The new mod, which has been developed by Holydh and is now available for free on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grandtheftautothetrilogy/mods/922">Nexus Mods</a>, includes everything players need to play San Andreas Definitive Edition in first-person VR with 6DOF motion controls. Thanks to the implementation of 6DOF controls in particular, it's possible to play the game from beginning to end in VR, as they allow the aiming of all ranged weapons, even in scripted shooting sequences in vehicles as a passenger. The functional Sniper Scope and Camera Screen with zoom in and out function also allows specific weapons that require using a sniper rifle to be completed in VR.</p>
<p><iframe title="San Andreas VR with 6DOF motion controls - UEVR Plugin Released" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIVeUHKR9S0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release of this VR mod definitely makes the purchase of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Definitive Edition more enticing for those who still prefer the original release, although the game, much like GTA 3 and Vice City Definitive Editions, has seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">considerable improvements</a> since its launch in late 2021. You can learn more about the issues that plagued Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition at launch by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy â€“ The Definitive Edition collects some truly groundbreaking games that still provide their share of nostalgic fun, but little has been done to make them shine here in 2021. Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low.</em></p>
