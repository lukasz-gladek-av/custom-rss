			<p>The Nintendo Switch version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already playable on PC and Android devices via emulators like EDEN.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">tabeneru</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases">EDEN emulator</a> can run the new entry in the popular series launching this week worldwide on PC and even Android devices rather well with the appropriate settings. </p>



<p>On PC, users don't even need a high-end system to run the game at the native 30FPS cap, as the user's system, powered by an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU, which is far from being the fastest system configuration, has no trouble running the game smoothly, at least in the shown segment. However, a high-end system is required to push the emulated Switch release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A past its resolution and framerate cap on PC with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SLbqzH04M&amp;t=2s">the first mod that allows up to 4K at 60 FPS gameplay</a> shared by Youtube user FRANC225. </p>

<p>Although Pokémon Legends: Z-A has yet to officially release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leak-online-early-builds-pokedex-more/">early copies of the game already reached the hands of players</a>, so it's not surprising to see the game already emulated on PC. However, this ability to emulate new titles may soon change. As development shifts to the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusively, it is widely expected that it will take a long time before an effective emulator for the new console becomes available on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows hasn't officially been announced for the Nintendo Switch 2, but we've seen multiple rumours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-ports/">even dating back to August 2024</a>, that the game would arrive on Nintendo's new console. After the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/">was rated by PEGI earlier this year</a>, it seemed like a lock that an announcement would arrive soon, likely at the next Nintendo Direct event.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">multiple chances for the game to show up at a Nintendo Direct</a> event since the rating went live, and still we've heard nothing, but a <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/assassins-creed-shadows-debarquera-bientot-sur-switch-2-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-60629">new report from Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> seems to have told us both when the game will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 and when we'll hear about it.</p>



<p>According to the report, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will be officially announced at some point before November 7, 2025, while the actual release date of the new version is expected to be December 5, 2025. Dealabs also reports that it expects the new version to be priced at "<em>around € 50</em>."</p>



<p>If Shadows arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 before the end of the year, then it'll be the second major Ubisoft title to make its way to the device after Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">which was actually a pleasant surprise in terms of its performance</a>. Hopefully, Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlKCBGzrB1I">follows in those footsteps</a>, and we're able to see the Nintendo Switch 2 continue to punch above its weight class and keep up, as best it can, with current-generation releases.</p>



<p>Its arrival in December would also technically make it the first 'new release' for the Assassin's Creed series under <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's new subsidiary with Tencent, Vantage Studios</a>. </p>



<p>For more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">you can check out our review from its initial release in March</a>, where Francesco De Meo gave the game an 8.7/10, saying, "<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em>" </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is being <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/pax-dei-arc-raiders-open-beta-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/">added to a new batch of games</a> at launch this month and as updates to games already available, with players sporting GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs getting the most out of DLSS 4 and all of NVIDIA's graphics technology. NVIDIA has also <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/arc-raiders-geforce-game-ready-driver/">released new drivers</a> for ARC Raiders ahead of its server slam test before it launches later this month.</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-little-nightmares-iii-and-crimson-desert-all-launching-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-support/">Battlefield 6 and Little Nightmares III</a> were the two highlights launching with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, and this week, the attention turns to Pax Dei, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/">new MMO arriving on PC </a>and as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-keeper-pax-dei-xbox-game-pass-october-2025/">Xbox Game Pass</a> this week on October 16, and Keeper, the latest game from Double Fine Productions, which is due to launch later this week on October 17 (and also directly into Xbox Game Pass) will launch with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support.</p>



<p>Fairlight84, the free-to-play PvP first-person shooter, where everyone has been turned into a new zombie-cyborg hybrid called 'Zomborgs,' also arrives this week on October 16, and with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Regarding the ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-opens-pre-orders-server-slam-oct-17-19/">server slam test going on this weekend</a>, you'll also be able to jump into that with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation turned on. Of course, you'll want to ensure you have the latest drivers installed, but once you do, you'll be good to go for this test and for the game's coming launch on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>Also happening this week, NBA2K26 gets support for DLSS Super Resolution, and if you are eligible for GeForce Rewards, then you'll be able to grab a free golden key for Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>A couple of notable titles are also launching later this month with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support, including Obsidian's second major RPG for the year, The Outer Worlds 2, and the long-awaited Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which launch on October 29, 2025 and October 21, 2025, respectively.</p>
