            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, on Tuesday, August 26, 2025, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">PlayStation game released on Xbox</a>, and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Xbox game released on PlayStation</a>. A topsy-turvy concept if you're talking to anyone who plays video games in 2006, but in 2025, we're getting more and more used to it. Gears of War Reloaded arrived on all current-gen platforms today, including PS5 and PS5 Pro, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8jBoIvToZY">Digital Foundry's analysis</a> of the game across all platforms confirms what players might've been able to guess leading up to its launch. As of today, the best way to play Gears of War (on console) is to play it on a PlayStation.</p>



<p>Specifically the PS5 Pro, which offers the best combination of performance and visuals on day-one. Digital Foundry's John Linneman reports that there's currently a VRR issue on Xbox Series devices, which holds its performance back compared to the new PlayStation versions.</p>



<p>Linneman also makes it clear that if all you're doing is looking to play Gears of War Reloaded in its standard 60FPS mode, then you're good with whatever console you choose. The PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, all deliver a rock-solid experience based on Linneman's testing. It's only when you try to play on the 120FPS mode where differences start to appear, in terms of performance. If you're trying to go for both performance and visuals though, then the PS5 Pro stands at the top.</p>



<p>"<em>PS5 Pro though, delivers the best results bar none,</em>" Linneman says. "<em>The 60FPS mode now runs at 1620p upscaled to 4K, while 120hz maintains the 1440p of the other consoles 60FPS mode.</em>" Linneman adds that the "<em>real kicker</em>" to the experience on the PS5 Pro is that The Coalition is using PlayStation's PSSR tech over AMD's FSR, and even though PSSR isn't fool-proof in delivering a better experience, it does so in the case of Gears of War Reloaded.</p>



<p>"<em>It's a case where this combination of a slightly higher pixel count in addition to PSSR produces a significantly better overall image on the PS5 Pro, making it easily the best of the bunch when talking about consoles</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gears of War Reloaded - DF Review - PS5/PS5 Pro/Xbox Series X|S/PC - The New Ultimate Edition?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8jBoIvToZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It should be noted that Linneman continues to say that the PC version can, of course, be pushed for the best experience, and that all of the console versions still deliver a "<em>sharp, attractive</em>" experience.</p>



<p>If all you care about is performance though, and don't have a PC to push Gears of War Reloaded beyond what's capable on consoles, then based on Linneman and Digital Foundry's analysis, the VRR bug on Xbox Series consoles is all that makes the 120FPS mode on Xbox fall behind the PlayStation versions. Whatever your pick, PlayStation or Xbox, you'll have a solid experience in terms of performance. </p>



<p>It's a bit funny, if not surprising, that PlayStation is the best console home for Gears of War Reloaded, even if it is by a technicality, since the PS5 Pro is not exactly a device that everyone rushed out to buy since it launched. Nor is it always the best choice, since we've seen multiple games get minimal improvements, or launch with issues that make it run worse on the PS5 Pro compared to base PS5 and Xbox Series devices. At least things will be a little more even whenever The Coalition is able to fix the VRR issue on Xbox.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-%E2%80%9Cidentity%E2%80%9D-crisis-concerns-black-ops-6-skins-and-weapons-will-no-longer-carry-forward-to-black-ops-7.1281153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025">blog post</a> on the Call of Duty website, publisher Activision directly addressed the fact that there has been a growing conversation around Call of Duty having an identity crisis, and confirmed that "<em>operators, operator skins, and weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</em>."</p>



<p>It's a bit of a surprising move, in a sense, because the idea that Call of Duty is not what it once was is a conversation that's been around since we started to see celebrity operator skins and fictional characters added into the game like it was a more realistically stylized version of Fortnite. It's not exactly a new talking point. </p>



<p>But now that Battlefield 6 has stormed in and<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/"> proved that there are thousands, if not millions</a>, of players, who don't care about playing as Cheech and Chong, Rambo, or Nicki Minaj in their realistic military FPS, Activision is ready to try and prove that Call of Duty hasn't forgotten its roots.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>First off, thank you. Call of Duty has always been fueled by the community. Every match, every clip, every bit of feedback; you’ve shaped this franchise right alongside us. </p><p>We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty. Some of you have… <a href="https://t.co/q9egebdlMD">pic.twitter.com/q9egebdlMD</a></p></div>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1960390735305335176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We know there's been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty. Some of you have said we've drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you</em>," the post reads. </p>



<p>It continues to say that the "<em>north star</em>" for Treyarch and Raven in developing Black Ops 7 has been to create a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2, which remains one of the more beloved games in the entire Call of Duty series. That's been the goal, but Activision stipulates they've strived for that "<em>while taking some big swings</em>."</p>



<p>Whether Treyarch and Raven achieve in creating a Black Ops 2 spiritual successor remains to be seen, but in regards to giving Black Ops 7 its own spotlight, that's where cancelling the carry forward with Black Ops 6 comes in. </p>



<p>"<em>Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting,</em>" Activision writes. "<em>That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.</em>" Warzone will remain the Call of Duty melting pot it is though, as Activision confirms that Warzone "<em>is not affected</em>" by this change, and that you'll still be able to access your Black Ops 6 operators, skins, and weapons, in Warzone.</p>



<p>The blog post continues to say that we'll have more information on how Black Ops 7 will retain the Call of Duty identity as an "<em>immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded</em>" shooter in the coming weeks, and reminds readers that Call of Duty NEXT will take place on September 30, which will include the multiplayer reveal for Black Ops 7 ahead of its first beta the following weekend.</p>



<p>This post might be what Activision thinks Call of Duty players want to hear, but those actually concerned that the series has lost its identity won't be satisfied with words alone. Those minds will be shifted by actions alone, and we'll see how Activision approaches its collaborations for Black Ops 7, and if players will continue to run around dressed up as celebrities and cartoon characters in multiplayer matches. Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, but there's a clear subset of the Call of Duty community that could do without it.</p>



<p>Besides, not once in this post does Activision say they won't be doing that with Black Ops 7, and with the no-carry forward not applying to Warzone, players looking for that experience will likely still find it there.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, we were able to go hands-on with The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and speak to two of the key developers from MachineGames (Lead Game Designer Ezekiel Virant and Creative Director Axel Torvenius) as they led us through the making of this expansion, which will be released on September 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and will eventually be available on Nintendo Switch 2 next year once the game launches there. Let's begin with the developers' words.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> The Order of Giants DLC's premise is that we set out to place the beginning of the DLC inside the Vatican sandbox, so you need to have played the game up to a certain point in the Vatican sandbox, and if you have the DLC installed, we have this new character called Father Orlando Ricci. When you interact with him, he will trigger a cutscene, which activates the DLC.</p>



<p>Father Ricci is obviously very, very obsessed with finding this secret chamber. He's also hinted that Father Ventura is onto him and that he's being forced out of the Vatican, which hints to the fact that only a small part of the DLC takes place inside the Vatican sandbox, maybe 10 or 15 minutes of gameplay, but then we quite quickly push the players to a complete new path, which is the streets of the Rome and the Tiber river and all the places underneath. Even the spaces in the Vatican sandbox were visible but inaccessible in the base game.</p>



<p>As you explore the DLC, you'll find lots of clues and hints, similar to what we did in the base game, in all the Chapters. We have tons of notes for you to find and fill out Indiana's journal. There are around 70 new collectibles in the DLC.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> You can take this mission anytime in the campaign, really, even if you've already completed the game and you have a save and buy The Order of Giants DLC, you can still fast travel back here and start this mission, so there's no need to start a whole new game. As soon as you've gotten the camera and met Gina, you're good to go with the DLC.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> From the moment you enter the casina onward, everything is completely new content. At the beginning of the DLC's production, we thought we should reuse some stuff, but in the end, not much has been reused from the main game. Basically, everything is freshly built and you have no sensation of, like, oh, I've seen this before, this is just rehashed content from the main game. Everything is completely new.</p>



<p><strong>So none of this is cut content from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Exactly, it's content that has been produced when we started to ramp down production on the main game, but obviously, there were some things when we were working on the main game where we were already planning for this. The concept images and stuff like that. We knew that we were going to hopefully be able to dive deeply into this part of the narrative with The Order of Giants.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Everything is freshly built and you have no sensation of, like, oh, I've seen this before, this is just rehashed content from the main game. Everything is completely new. It's content that has been produced when we started to ramp down production on the main game.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It was one of the big mysteries of the game, after all.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yeah, so it's one of those nice opportunities to finally be able to actually do a DLC that dives a little bit deeper into the mystery of it.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> We also have all-new puzzle mechanics. We are not recycling any of the old mechanics from other areas. There is a mix of big and small puzzles to get that balance between them.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> By the way, you can fast travel in and out of the DLC as you see fit.</p>



<p><strong>Is The Order of the Giants DLC harder than the base game when it comes to combat and/or puzzles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> I think the puzzles lean towards being a little bit more difficult than the base game, actually, but of course, we still have hints. And we also still have the adventure mode if you want to have a simpler time in some of the puzzles. In terms of the combat, depending on where you are with the base game, the game will actually scale the difficulty. So, if you're starting right from the Vatican, it will be easier, but if you're in the endgame, the enemies will be more challenging.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> We will also be connecting the dots from certain narrative threads seen in the main game. Moreover, in terms of visual fidelity, everything that you'll see in the DLC is at a minimum as good-looking and polished as in the base game, and in some instances, it's even better. Similar to what we have in the main game as well, everything starts with a small mystery and then grows from there. In The Order of Giants, Father Ricci asks you to find the secret chamber and the giant helmet found within, but there's much more to it, so Indiana will have to keep digging.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> We have multiple larger puzzles like this one in the DLC, similar to the base game. There are a lot of layers and mechanics, new mechanics, and we're truly trying to push the player all around the environment. This is one of the brand-new mechanics that we started working on immediately after the base game wrapped up. In most Indiana Jones adventures, the puzzles that he unravels start with him figuring out the mechanics, and then once he gets into a good flow, something breaks, and he has to clear the breakage or do something else.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>What we heard from them is that they just wish there were more puzzles and also that they were more difficult. There were a lot of puzzles that we wished we could have made, so this was an opportunity for the team to take those ideas from the back of their mind, start putting them into the game, and try new things.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Did you incorporate any feedback from the players' experience with the base game into the design of these new puzzles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yeah, we've watched a lot of players while they interact with our puzzles. I think what we heard from them is that they just wish there were more puzzles and also that they were more difficult. There were a lot of puzzles that we wished we could have made, so this was an opportunity for the team to take those ideas from the back of their mind, start putting them into the game, and try new things.</p>



<p>The designer who worked on this puzzle had an idea to rotate something with a wrench, and players could slot the wrench in and out. Then, another designer who had been working on the redirection maze for a while joined him to create this one.</p>



<p>One unique aspect of developing these puzzles compared to those from the base game is that they were finally done in our office. Most of those in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were made during COVID, when people were forced to work remotely. This is the first time the people could meet physically to design them.</p>



<p>There are more secrets to be found on the levels. Something that we've always tried to maintain is to allow for new paths to open, for new secrets to be revealed, so there's always this layering of the environments where you dig deeper and find something new, and depending on your playstyle, you may be able to find more stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> This traversal section is one that was just so super inspired. One of the designers who worked on this was someone who didn't do a big traversal section throughout the main game, but we had the opportunity to try a lot of new ideas with the DLC. Since the engine was in such a good shape that we had all the mechanics nailed down, it was easy for us to experiment and make new things without having to worry about bugs. This traversal scenario here, where you deal with pulleys and weights and moving up and down, shows off this brand new mechanics; it's a whole new way of using the whip.</p>



<p>This whole level here is like that. We started designing new mechanics and new features. We began by putting together a fresh view of mechanics with this rope and these pulleys. The designer had it in their mind, and I think they actually tried to do it a year or two ago, but only had the opportunity to make it work and get all the tech pieces in place for The Order of Giants DLC. When we first started doing this level design and walking it out, we actually found that it was getting longer, but people were having a lot of fun, so we increased the scope and the complexity of this whole scenario, just based on just internal player feedback. We felt it would be a missed opportunity otherwise.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an estimate of the length of The Order of Giants DLC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> In terms of time spent, it's similar to a sandbox environment in the main game, so it's around 5 to 6 hours, but if you are a completionist and want to find everything, then I think it's more, and if you are a very skilled player who knows how to solve all the puzzles on first try, maybe it's shorter. But I've been playing through the final build back home in the studio and I think I'm at, like, four and a half hours, but then I know everything. Some of the puzzles can be very challenging even at medium difficulty, but that's why we also have easy difficulty available. If you don't want to spend too much time on puzzles, you should still be able to navigate through and continue the adventure. </p>



<p>I think it's important to emphasize that this is not a puzzle DLC. It's still primarily a story-driven narrative DLC. The balance here is similar to what we have in the base game: large puzzles, small puzzles, hard combat, light combat, cutscenes, set pieces, tense action, even some boss fight. Everything that was in the main game is represented in the DLC as well.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>In terms of time spent, it's similar to a sandbox environment in the main game, so it's around 5 to 6 hours, but if you are a completionist and want to find everything, then I think it's more, and if you are a very skilled player who knows how to solve all the puzzles on first try, maybe it's shorter.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Basically, everything players loved about the base game, they're getting more of it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yep. Exactly the same type of tone, sensation, same humor and everything. It's very much like an extension of the main game. I think that's something we felt was very correct to do, because we're still telling a new, standalone, unique adventure, a new story. But we saw so much feedback from the player community where people were like, we want more Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Finally, we had the opportunity to get the DLC out, which is just doing that. It's adding more to the beloved world of Indiana Jones.</p>



<p><strong>Earlier, you talked about the game's fidelity, which is already great. But I know that you are also improving upon it with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-hair-coming-september-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming RTX Hair update</a>. Can you talk about that a bit?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> I can't go into technical details, but what we're happy to see is that the development and integration of RTX Hair makes it so much better. Actually, there's a lot of things in the game that can benefit from it, because many things utilize the hair system, not just hair itself. It's a system that is used over other aspects as well. Everything that is fur or hair-related will have better render fidelity.</p>



<p>Some people may think it's a small thing, but there are all those small things that add up. The details and everything just make everything come together. We are really happy with the RTX Hair integration.</p>



<p><strong>I know that you <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-nintendo-switch-2-release-order-of-the-giants-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a Switch 2 version</a>, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yeah, it will be released next year.</p>



<p><strong>Are you doing that internally, or is that work being outsourced?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yes, most of the work is done internally. Our CTO, the engineers, and the programmers are working on it to ensure it is as good as we can possibly make it on a handheld platform.</p>



<p><strong>You already ported the previous Wolfenstein games to Nintendo Switch, correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yes, both the last two Wolfenstein games. It's a continuation of Machinegames bringing the titles to Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Which is great. As a developer, you want to own as many as possible so that your game can be enjoyed, so we were very happy with the Switch 2 confirmation.</p>



<p><strong>One last question. Can you share whether there will be more of Gina in this DLC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Gina is not part of the DLC. This is more of Indiana Jones going on a little bit of a rogue adventure on the side. Gina is most likely still back undercover in the Vatican, doing some research at this point.</p>



<p>That was one of the reasons we wanted to really focus on Indiana Jones and the core of the IP to push him on a side quest. Obviously, we have a lot of sections in the main game where we do things together with Gina, which is nice because we want that balance. She's an important character, but we also see that it's cool when you're completely alone and you get the sensation that it's only up to you to solve the mystery, so it fits in within that balance too.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yeah. I think Indie is a bit distracted at this point and he wants to keep searching and pushing, whereas Gina is really on a beeline to find her sister.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> In The Order of Giants DLC, you'll see Father Ricci, but there are also appearances of Father Ventura and Mussolini as well.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Based on what we played at Gamescom 2025, The Order of Giants looks like a thoughtful extension of what people (the undersigned included) already loved about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: awesome graphics, outstanding puzzles, and great atmosphere. There are also some interesting new platforming mechanics, too, especially those based around Indy's whip. The demo only featured a very brief combat scene, but according to the developers, fans should expect roughly the same split between combat, exploration, and narrative that made the base game so great.</p>



<p>There's not much to wait to experience the new content, with the DLC slated to hit all platforms on September 4. Look forward to our review soon. </p>
