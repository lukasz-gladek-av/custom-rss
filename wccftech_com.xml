			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/18/xbox-game-pass-november-2025-wave-2/">announced the remaining games</a> heading to Xbox Game Pass for the back half of November 2025, and paired with the games that already joined the service this month, it makes November arguably the most stacked month Xbox Game Pass has had in 2025. An additional nine games are joining the service between today and December 1, including Marvel Cosmic Invasion and The Crew Motorfest.</p>



<p>Two of the nine games are day one arrivals into Game Pass, including the aforementioned Cosmic Invasion and Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, which is finally set to launch in early access after it was delayed <a href="https://wccftech.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-officially-set-to-launch-in-summer-2025/">from its initial summer 2025 release window</a>. The sequel to the action-adventure game that lets you lead a double life as a shopkeeper and a dangerous explorer is looking to build on the momentum of the original, which sold more than two million copies overall.</p>



<p>Besides the two-day-one launches, two of the other notable titles entering the service this month are the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">latest entry in Ubisoft's popular driving series, The Crew Motorfest</a> and last year's action game from DON'T NOD, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.</a> There are also two more releases from this year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>.</p>



<p>Under Xbox's new tiered system for Game Pass, we know that most day-one releases will only be available to those at the top-tier Ultimate level subscription, but it's worth pointing out that in this batch of Game Pass additions, seven out of nine are only available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>In fact, it's worth noting that none of the games entering the service today will be available to players at the lowest tier, Game Pass Essential. At least those players at the bottom tier aren't losing any games with the titles leaving the service this month.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of Xbox Game Pass games coming to the service for the rest of November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - November 19 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo - November 19 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Revenge of the Savage Planet - November 19 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road - November 19 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest - November 20 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - November 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Kill It With Fire! 2 - November 25 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Marvel Cosmic Invasion - December 1 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - December 2 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This month, on November 30, Game Pass subscribers will no longer have access to the following five games through their subscription:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barbie Project Friendship</li>



<li>Lords of the Fallen</li>



<li>Octopath Traveler</li>



<li>Octopath Traveler 2</li>



<li>SteamWorld Build</li>
</ul>

			<p>Today, NCSOFT subsidiary ArenaNet delivered a surprise announcement with Guild Wars Reforged, an updated version of the classic MMORPG that will be released on December 3.</p>



<p>The original game launched in April 2005 and established the studio originally founded by former Blizzard developers. Over the years, Guild Wars was played by more than nine million users, who spent over a billion hours in the fantasy world of Tyria. ArenaNet eventually released the sequel seven years later and has focused mainly on <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-expansion-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2</a> ever since, but a small fanbase remained loyal to the original.</p>



<p>Guild Wars Reforged is being co-developed with 2weeks, a small studio founded last year by former ArenaNet developers. Brandon Dillon, co-founder of 2weeks, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>It’s a real treat to revisit the original Guild Wars. Beginning as a teenager, I’ve been involved with this franchise from the very start, collaborating with the original studio founders to create the world of Tyria. Partnering with ArenaNet to update and improve the player experience means the game can continue to be a beloved beacon for fans of multiplayer online RPGs for years to come.</em></p>



<p>Game Director Stephen Clarke-Willson added:</p>



<p><em>Even after two decades, we’re still passionate about improving the experience of the original Guild Wars for players. The game has a dedicated group of fans, and with this update to modernize the experience, we hope players new and old will find a reason to continue adventuring through Tyria together.</em></p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Guild Wars Reforged will deliver controller support, make the game Steam Deck verified, and also bring a host of graphic enhancements, such as high-DPI support for modern high-resolution monitors, new HD skill icons, rendering improvements including new antialiasing options, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom, more font size options for game text, enhanced 3D environmental audio, and a new quest-tracker.</p>

<p>Reforged is free for existing users, though new users can get it via Steam or Windows PC for $19.99 with all the expansions (Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall) included. </p>
