			<p>To celebrate the 6th anniversary of Apex Legends, Respawn Entertainment has released a Dev Diary where players can find out about what to expect for the rest of the year, as well as some major updates coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/">the game</a>. This includes features such as Matchmaking, Anti-Cheat, and Competitive Integrity. If you want to see what's coming in Apex Legends: Takeover, make sure to check out the Dev Diary below, where Game Director Steven Ferreira and Design Director Evan Nikolich will be discussing the update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: Takeover Dev Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRAKqGo_wBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are some major changes coming with Takeover, including Creator Commissioners. This means that some of the community's favorite Creators will be bringing in unique and curated challenges to Apex Legends with Creator-selected Legendary Weapon Skins and Apex Pack rewards. If you want to participate, you can get these rewards both solo and as a community, giving you plenty of opportunities to get the skins.</p>
<p>For those who have a competitive streak, there will be some major meta changes to give the game a mix-up. This includes Assault Legends getting new perks such as Extra Firepower, Armed and Dangerous, and players now getting extra ammo, grenade slots, and improved weapon handling. For the first time in Apex Legends' history, every single weapon in the game has got a buff this season, meaning some of the favorite weapons used will be more dangerous than ever.</p>
<p>To celebrate six years of Apex Legends, there will also be an anniversary event. In total, there are 36 Anniversary Event items that you can obtain, with every item being Legendary or above. This includes Heirloom Shards and the first-of-its-kind Mythic R-301.</p>
<p>The Mythic R-301 is a Wraith-inspired weapon that has three unlockable tiers with a void-inspired look. Along with its release, there will be new animations for the weapon, including reloads and enemy knock effects.</p>
<p>There were already many ways to get weaponry and gear from around the map, but Apex Legends is now receiving a new feature named Arsenals. These are weapon stations that bring every weapon of a single ammo type and can be seen from the sky. Having these in the games it means that there is a level of planning that players can utilize rather than relying on RNG to get good loot.</p>
<p>For information on the Anti-Cheat changes and Competitive Integrity, there is a news post available on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/dev-update-0225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Apex Legends website</a> where you can find out more about what changes they've made to the system.</p>
<p>The Apex Legends: Takeover trailer will be released tomorrow, where you'll get to see some of the brand-new features in action. After that, you won't have long to wait, as the update will be launching on February 11 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
