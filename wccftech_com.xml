			<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake revealed via <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/">a massive NVIDIA GeForce Now leak a few years ago</a> is the only leaked Square Enix game that has yet to be officially announced, and if the information shared online by an insider with a solid track record is any indication, its official announcement will probably still take some time.</p>



<p>A few days ago, Reddit user TomAto314, whose claims of having access to insider information are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lkhd4k/comment/nepsfts/?context=3">backed by their reveals</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-website-remake/">Timeless Tale record released in time for the Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary celebrations</a> ahead of official announcements, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lkhd4k/comment/nepsfts/?context=3">claimed</a> that the game has been in their company's database for three years, they have never received a build for testing, and all updates on it only mention a delay until 2024, which doesn't sound very promising.</p>



<p>While the user has a solid track record to date, we have to take the information they have provided with a huge grain of salt. Nonetheless, it does <span>align with what other known insiders, such as Nate Drake, previously said&nbsp;regarding the project's status, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-trouble-canceled/">development troubles and even cancellation</a>, so there's a high chance it&nbsp;</span>is still a long way from release, if development is still proceeding.</p>



<p>Although the status of the rumored Final Fantasy IX remake is uncertain, PC players can enjoy the ninth entry in the series with vastly improved visuals and new features thanks to the Moguri Mod. The 9.0 version of the mod, released last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-moguri-mod-9-0-download/">introduces improved field backgrounds, reworked battle backgrounds, and more</a> for a vastly improved experience.</p>

			<p>Like the vast majority of modern games, Silent Hill f features a New Game Plus mod that has plenty of new content to offer over a regular first playthrough, which is not enough to fully experience the story, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">I highlighted in my review of the game</a>.

<figure><figcaption><em>The Legend of the Sacred Sword is a central new quest in New Game Plus mode</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In New Game Plus, you can complete some new quests, such as The Sacred Sword quest. Completing these quests is very rewarding, as you can get new items, some of which are required to unlock new endings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The long-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Forza Horizon 6</a> was undoubtedly the highlight of Xbox's Tokyo Game Show 2025 Broadcast. As fans had long speculated (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry insiders had recently suggested</a>), the next setting will be Japan. In an interview <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the Xbox Wire blog</a>, Playground Games Art Director Don Arceta teased that the open world of Forza Horizon 6 will blow away players with its beauty and variety.</p>



<p><em>While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer. From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built. And while we are not necessarily trying to recreate Japan and its environments like for like, our goal has always been to capture the country’s unique cultural essence and present it back in the most Horizon way possible.</em></p>



<p>The Seasons system that was introduced initially with Forza Horizon 4 will return in Forza Horizon 6, as confirmed by Cultural Consultant Kyoko Yamashita:</p>



<p><em>The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound. The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.</em></p>



<p>More information about Forza Horizon 6 will be released in early 2026. The game will launch next year on PC and Xbox consoles first, with a PlayStation 5 version already confirmed to be coming at a later date.</p>
