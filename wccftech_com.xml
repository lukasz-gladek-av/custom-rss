			<p><strong>MindsEye </strong>developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong> has <strong>ended its publishing deal</strong> with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-devleoper-confirms-new-game-is-coming-007-only-external-ip-studio-would-work-on/">Hitman</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-need-to-empty-your-wallet-for-more-ram-007-first-light-updated-system-requirements-lower-ram-and-vram-recomendations/">007: First Light</a></strong> developer <strong>IO Interactive</strong>, according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/">Insider-Gaming</a>. MindsEye was the first game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/">IO Interactive published under its new publishing label</a>, and it might just be its last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">if reports from <strong>last year</strong></a>, and now this, are to be believed. </p>



<p>That said, according to the report, the decision to end the deal came from Build a Rocket Boy's side, not IO Interactive. This is said to come from Build a Rocket Boy wanting to start publishing its games internally and ultimately have more control over its future. This also reportedly means that the previously planned MindsEye and Hitman collaboration has been cancelled.</p>



<p>Now that 2025 is in the books, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has more GOTY awards than any other game before it</a>, if you were wondering what's at the opposite end of the spectrum, that would be MindsEye, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/2025/metascore/?page=19">at least according to Metacritic</a>. Only earning a <strong>37</strong>, it was the <strong>worst-reviewed game of 2025</strong>, after it had a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">disastrous launch</a></strong>.</p>



<p>To say it was an extremely bug-plagued game at launch would be an understatement. It was bad enough that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation gave players refunds</a></strong> because the game was so broken. And when it was working, critics and players hammered the lack of anything to do and its less-than-enticing story.</p>



<p>It was a bad situation for Build a Rocket Boy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">The game didn't have the worst sales launch,</a> all things considered, but the word-of-mouth and the barrage of memes and clips of the game's worst moments killed any momentum the team at Build a Rocket Boy could have had. The studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">suffered layoffs</a>,</strong> and developers called out the studio leadership, which included former <strong>Rockstar</strong> producer <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">damning open letter</a>.</p>



<p>An even more <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">damning report from the BBC a week later</a> revealed more about the internal issues at Build a Rocket Boy, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">while the studio has tried to update and fix the game</a>, it feels more likely that it will run out of financial runway and get shut down before it has a chance to see its full vision for MindsEye realized.</p>



<p>Considering all of this, it's interesting that the report indicates the decision to cut ties came from Build a Rocket Boy's side, and not IO Interactive. Maybe this is because Build a Rocket Boy has a comeback plan it wants full autonomy over. We'll see if that's the case, though it's worth noting that so far, neither Build a Rocket Boy or IO Interactive have officially confirmed or denied this report.</p>

			<p><strong>Nintendo</strong> is due to have its third <strong>Nintendo Direct event</strong> of the year <strong>next week</strong> on <strong>Thursday, February 5, 2026</strong>, and it'll be a <strong>Partner Showcase Direct</strong>, if multiple reports surrounding this rumour are to be believed.</p>



<p>After first coming from known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c">NateTheHate</a> (who has also predicted that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/"><strong>PlayStation State of Play</strong> is on the horizon for <strong>February</strong></a>), their report about a coming Nintendo Direct was corroborated by <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">GameXplain</a>, who then added that it would be a Partner Showcase, which was corroborated by NateTheHate, and as of today, both rumours have been corroborated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a>.</p>



<p>Next Thursday is the predicted date, and if it is indeed a Partner Showcase, that means we can only expect to see <strong>third-party related</strong> announcements, which means we likely won't get any news at all regarding what Nintendo has coming. Instead, it'll be about what the rest of the industry is bringing to the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this Direct event does happen next week, it'll already be the <strong>third</strong> Nintendo Direct event of 2026, after the year began with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-nintendo-direct-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</a></strong> that revealed a first proper look at <strong>Yoshi</strong> in the film, followed by a Direct event dedicated to <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a></strong>.</p>



<p>But if you're not looking forward to either the film or Tomodachi Life, then next week's rumoured Direct is likely the first one you might actually tune in for. We could get another look at Switch 2 exclusive titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">The Duskbloods</a></strong>, and upcoming Switch 2 ports like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-into-2026/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Borderlands 4</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">007: First Light</a></strong>. </p>



<p>This may even be the event where we finally see <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/"><strong>Call of Duty</strong> announced for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and those are just some guesses at some of the bigger announcements we could see. There are also scores of potential indie game reveals that could happen at this rumoured event.</p>



<p>But Nintendo has to confirm it's actually happening before we can really start to speculate at what will be there. The last Partner Showcase Nintendo hosted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">was in <strong>July 2025</strong></a>, and it announced the event the day before it happened. If Nintendo sticks to that same strategy, then we should expect a reveal next <strong>Wednesday</strong>. </p>
