			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that Diablo IV: Season of Divine Intervention is going live on December 11, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-ptr-tests-big-core-changes-itemization-monster-combat-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after several weeks of testing on the Public Test Realm</a>.</p>



<p>The game's eleventh season introduces 'evolved monsters', as they were described by the studio, increasing the challenge players will face when playing the latest installment in the studio's acclaimed hack-and-slash action RPG series. Monster AI and affixes have been overhauled: enemies react more dynamically, elites and champions hit harder and come with over twenty new affixes, champion packs are formalized, and packs clump less. These changes apply across all Diablo IV content, including Nightmare Dungeons.</p>



<p>Blizzard also releases the long-awaited itemization overhaul with Diablo IV: Season of Intervention:</p>



<ul>
<li>Non‑unique items now drop with four base affixes instead of three, and Sanctification (channeling Angelic power into gear) becomes a final, irreversible upgrade that can add a bonus legendary power, Greater Affix, special Sanctification affixes, and 5–25 extra Quality while locking the item from further modification; Sanctification, which occasionally can even make items indestructible, is earned via Heavenly Anvils and Heavenly Sigils at higher tiers.</li>



<li>Tempering now lets players pick a specific affix from a recipe instead of rolling randomly; items get only one tempered affix, but charges are infinite, and Ancestral items can occasionally upgrade the tempered affix into a Greater Affix. </li>



<li>Masterworking uses a new Quality (0–25) stat that increases base damage/armor/resists and all affix values by 1% per Quality level; Masterworking adds 2–5 Quality per upgrade, with costs scaling by current Quality, and a final Capstone Bonus roll at max Quality that boosts one random affix (Greater included) by 50%.</li>
</ul>

<p>As previously announced, Blizzard has also overhauled the defense stats to equalize effective Health across classes better and builds. Diablo IV: Season of Intervention introduces rating‑based Armor and Resistances (with diminishing returns and Armor now reducing all damage types), a new Physical Damage Resistance, and a unified Toughness stat that summarizes effective HP against each damage type and can be compared on item tooltips. Many skills and Paragon nodes that granted generic damage reduction now give multiplicative bonuses to Armor, or all Resistances; Fortify is redesigned from DR into an extra Life reservoir that slowly heals the player character at the cost of Fortify.</p>



<p>Potions have been redesigned as well. They're now reduced to a base stack of 4, but now provide an instant 35% max‑life heal, and passively regenerate one charge every 30 seconds. Life on Hit, Life Regeneration, Life on Kill, and Healing % are buffed and more available, potion tier upgrades are removed, and Welcome Back Booster handling is adjusted for future seasons.</p>



<p>There are significant tweaks to the Season Journey, too. Season Rank is replacing Renown on the Seasonal Realm; players advance through the ranks by completing objectives and a Capstone Dungeon at each tier, earning Skill points, Paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, cosmetics, Heavenly Sigils, and other rewards. The Eternal Realm, on the other hand, keeps traditional Renown with some adjustments. </p>



<p>Five Capstone Dungeons (Vault of the Crucible, Hellish Descent, Enclave of Darkness, Den of the Apostate, Breach of Sin) have now been built into an all-new system aimed at challenging progress through the many difficulty tiers, from Hard through Torment III, as the character grows in power. Despite Capstone Dungeons stating a suggested level at which to attempt them, their difficulty does not actually scale with the character's current level.</p>

<p>Story-wise, Diablo IV: Season of Intervention features the angel Hadriel aiding Sanctuary's heroes. In Seasonal Realms, players follow his light in towns to start the seasonal questline. The Lesser Evils each invade a specific endgame mode: Duriel takes over Helltide, Belial corrupts The Pit, Andariel infests the Kurast Undercity, and Azmodan becomes both a permanent world boss and a summonable challenge in Hawezar with variant powers from the others; their minions gain themed affixes and visual readability updates.</p>



<p>Killing each Lesser Evil unlocks two Divine Gifts tied to that boss. Gifts have a Reward track plus Corrupted and Purified socket options that change difficulty and benefits for activities like Helltide, The Pit, Undercity, and World Bosses (for example, more socketables from Pangs of Duriel but harsher maggot threats, or extra Tower/Pit upgrades in exchange for lethal Belial eye beams). Divine Gifts level up as players farm their associated content, and Purified slots for each Lesser Evil unlock at specific Season Rank milestones (Duriel IV, Andariel VI, Azmodan VIII, Belial X).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, in Patch 2.5.2 (tentatively slated for early 2026), the multi‑stage timed dungeon The Tower and its Leaderboards return in Beta: Tower difficulty tiers will unlock independently, some problematic bosses will be removed, and class and party‑specific leaderboards will track clears by tier, time, date, platform, and mode (Normal/Hardcore) with filters for friends and clans.</p>



<p>Diablo IV will get its second expansion, following 2024's Vessel of Hatred, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at some point in 2026</a>. The original plan was <a href="https://wccftech.com/annual-diablo-4-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to release annual expansions</a>, but it ultimately proved unfeasible for Blizzard. </p>
