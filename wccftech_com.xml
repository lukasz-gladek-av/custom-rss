			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-is-out-next-week-adding-a-new-class-and-tons-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt</a> press presentation, Grinding Gear Games Game Director Jonathan Rogers sat down to answer several questions from the assembled press, both regarding the new expansion and the game as a whole. You can find the full transcript below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dawn of the Hunt will launch simultaneously on April 4th across all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-CnACIrCOkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 has two radically different gameplay tempos: the slow, methodical campaign and the faster endgame, more similar to the first game. Do you aim to slow down the end game and provide players with more agency to use slow reactive skills like parry, blocks, and combo skills?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to that is that it's not that in the endgame things suddenly change or anything. It's just that there are various meta builds that I would say were overpowered and have led to a situation where, in order to fight in the endgame effectively, people have tended to center around a few broken things. Now, this patch also contains a full rebalance that will improve a lot of the more broken things that have been going on, which means that we don't have as many people feeling like they're forced into some of that stuff, which should balance things out. The other thing is that we're changing the on-ramp to endgame quite a bit, especially with things like being able to die in the endgame. You should be in a scenario where people don't feel the need to use that staff and those builds are not so much available. We do want to make it so that you can still get very powerful as you go through, but it should be more earned than it is currently, where there's just a few broken things. It will take a while for us to get all that stuff fully resolved. It might take a few iterations before every single broken thing is ironed, but it's a constant goal and we'll get there in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Will unique bosses created by wisps drop increased loot?</strong></p>
<p>Yep, absolutely. That's the whole point.</p>
<p><strong>Are we going to face monsters as strong as we've seen in the first Path of Exile if we juice the wisps too hard?</strong></p>
<p>We've obviously got a very different balance overall. One thing we want to try and avoid is having monsters that are just complete damage sponges. That being said, it is important that you have the ability to make mistakes, to go too far with this kind of stuff. If you add a lot of mechanics to maps, you can get to the point where content becomes very, very difficult, but obviously more rewarding as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any information about the development progress of the Druid class?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have anything to announce right now. The plan is to announce it and release it as soon as we can. Classes do take a long time. There's a lot of work involved in them. One thing we've definitely learned is that it's hard to promise a specific release timeline for a class.</p>
<p><strong>In the last season, there wasn't much of a balancing nerfing the class skills or items. Are you going to make balance changes during the season or continue the way you did in the last season?</strong></p>
<p>When we went into early access with Path of Exile 2, we did believe that we'd be able to do a bunch of nerfing and that kind of stuff during leagues, which we don't normally do. We quickly found out that it's really just like a live game. You can't just nerf stuff mid-league because it breaks people's builds and they get very angry. We pretty much stopped doing that very quickly. This update will do a huge amount of balance and then anything really egregious we'll fix as it comes up, but generally speaking, we try to leave the balance mostly alone during the league. We now effectively bottle up all of those balance changes and then we release them when we're doing a season. As I said, it's a full game rebalance this time. A lot of the things that players are currently complaining about, like Herald Device and this kind of stuff, will definitely get nerfed this season.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Different Rogue exiles have different sets. There are lots of different ones that they can have. There's actually 12 Rogue exiles in this version. The idea is to try and make it so that, basically, the big full set of uniques that could drop from regular content can spawn on them. They all have specific AI for those uniques but they have lots of different options. There'll be Rogue exiles that contain most uniques that you would want to find. They're very interesting fights because they know how to use the items. They're pretty cool and&nbsp;feel very PvP-like. They're dodge rolling around and everything.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do Rogue exiles have preset items, or will it be completely random?</strong></p>
<p>They do have random items, but I believe that different Rogue exiles have different sets. There are lots of different ones that they can have. There's actually 12 Rogue exiles in this version. The idea is to try and make it so that, basically, the big full set of uniques that could drop from regular content can spawn on them. They all have specific AI for those uniques but they have lots of different options. There'll be Rogue exiles that contain most uniques that you would want to find. They're very interesting fights because they know how to use the items. They're pretty cool and feel very PvP-like. They're dodge rolling around and everything.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of changes in the new content touch on player feedback. How do you balance that with Grinding Gear's vision for Path of Exile 2?</strong></p>
<p>We always listen to the players to determine what the problems are, but we still have our ideas with regard to how we're going to solve those problems. The players are really the ones bringing things to our attention. Normally, there'll always be some kind of third way. Like, we've got an idea of how it should be, and the players have an idea of how it should be. If we try to combine the concerns of both us and them, we'll come up with a third way. There are a few issues that aren't like that, but generally speaking, we're always going to be able to come up with some kind of thing that both the players can get excited about and we can feel happy about as well. Ideally, that's the best solution.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to enable players to loot items from the ground in case they die immediately after killing a mob?</strong></p>
<p>That's kind of something that I would say is pretty disliked as far as solutions go, because we tend to avoid things that don't make any physical sense thematically. Obviously, if you're dead you can't pick items. I know that's one of those issues that players are unhappy about, but fundamentally, there is just a thing of if you die, you don't get to loot stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Will the least-played Ascendancies, as Acolyte, Chronomancer, Warbringer, and Witch Hunter, get changed in the update?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't say Chronomancer is not very well played, but for the others, the overall balance is changing very significantly. The reason why certain Ascendancies are played the most is usually because there's something broken going on with them. It isn't necessarily the case that the less played ones need buffing, although in lots of cases, we will do it. Effectively, all your previous assumptions just need to be thrown in the bin because there's enough changes as far as balance is concerned that you just can't expect things to work exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>Can the Smith of Katava take multiple of the armor modifiers, and does it require committing one Ascendancy point for each of them?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can take as many as you like as long as you have Ascendancy points. It's a question of, do you want to be using the other elements of the class or do you want to go all in on those armor modifiers, which can be pretty powerful. There's just quite a lot of choice there in this class.</p>
<p><strong>What additional uses do you have planned for gold in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not going to announce any right now, but it's just useful having that currency around.</p>
<p><strong>It looks like map portals are tied to the number of resurrects and get lower if it gets harder. If we have some maps with fewer portals to go back and forth, does it mean we won't be able to carry as many items, especially for maps with multiple breaches?</strong></p>
<p>That is the case. However, I guess the theory here is that you shouldn't generally need to take more than an inventory or two full of items. It is a concern, though, and we'll have to see how well it works. I would hope there's something that we can do to alleviate that. I'm just thinking right now that maybe after the map is completed, we could allow potentially more, but I'll have to think about that. It's actually something that I should probably um investigate a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>Will Temporalis get removed or overhauled? It broke the game in several ways.</strong></p>
<p>It's not getting removed and it's not getting overhauled either. It might get nerfed a little bit but I should mention that it's not like everyone should be getting a temporalis just on demand. It's supposed to be a very hard unique to get. Just due to the other balance issues, it meant that getting a Temporalis was much easier than it would have otherwise been. Consider what you actually have to do to get one: you have to be able to play through Sanctum without getting hit one time. It shouldn't be something that is easy to get. Sometimes, we balance things by rarity, like, they are supposed to be a broken thing, but if you get them, they are incredibly ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is one of those cases, but because there were builds that allowed things to be very broken, it just meant that there were too many of them in the economy. Something I just want to stress is that it should be possible to become incredibly powerful. It's just that it shouldn't be the case that you get that without a huge amount of effort. For example, it really was a problem that the pinnacle bosses got killed in like 14 seconds the first time that people fought them. It really should be a long, protracted battle the first time, but of course, once you've played it several times, you've had more time to grind other stuff, you get to the top of the end of what is economically possible.</p>
<p>At that point it's fine to be killing pinnacle bosses in 14 seconds. It's just that it shouldn't be like that the first time. It's a question of getting the power scaling right. When you release a new game, there's just tons of stuff that's unintended.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I am definitely very keen to get it done this year. I would be very disappointed if we weren't able to. It's not 100% guaranteed. We might slip. I'm still very much hoping that we're not going to. Looking at the content of this particular expansion, there's a lot of stuff going on here and a lot of it is reactionary to the problems that we saw with the game, but in the background, we've still got artists and people all working on other acts. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on in creating the rest of the content.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are you planning to adjust the drop rates of currency items?</strong></p>
<p>There's always adjustments. Generally speaking, normal currency is mostly fine. We don't really have a particular issue with it. There are certain things, for example omens are not common enough and we made it so that every ritual has an omen in it now. But I wouldn't say overall that currency items needed a buff or anything like that. We're mostly happy with them.</p>
<p><strong>Any hints about the remaining story? Will they be released individually or maybe as a big story </strong><strong>league or expansion?</strong></p>
<p>We are planning on launching them later. We're not going to announce when that's going to be for the time being, but obviously, they all have to get done by the time we get into full release.</p>
<p><strong>You initially talked about wanting the Path of Exile 2 early access phase to last one year. Now we're a little further in, does it still feel like a realistic goal to reach the state you want for 1.0?</strong></p>
<p>I am definitely very keen to get it done this year. I would be very disappointed if we weren't able to.<br>
It's not 100% guaranteed. We might slip. I'm still very much hoping that we're not going to. Looking at the content of this particular expansion, there's a lot of stuff going on here and a lot of it is reactionary to the problems that we saw with the game, but in the background, we've still got artists and people all working on other acts. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on in creating the rest of the content. We might have released more of that stuff if it hadn't been for the fact that we felt like we had to add a lot of in-game features. Can we get it done this year? I think it's possible.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to change gold so it isn't a drop item but rather an auto-pickup on kill, like expedition artifacts received that QoL in Path of Exile?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely not. I think it's nice that you pick it up. It's got a relatively large pickup radius; you just run over it. I don't have any particular problems with this myself at this point.</p>
<p><strong>What changes to the trading system can players expect during the Path of Exile 2 early access?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have anything to announce about this, but I do have some things I want to try and improve here. Obviously, currency is much easier to trade. There are other things people want to do with trading. There are things that I would potentially change,&nbsp;and we definitely want to make sure we're testing those changes before the end of early access because it's one of those things that can affect the economy pretty significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Will the new update implement more cosmetics people have unlocked in POE1?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is yes. I don't have a list of them, but we're continuing to move through that list and add more things, so yes, more of them will be added.</p>
<p><strong>Will you please clarify if this update is a league on its own or if there will be several leagues before the next major content update?</strong></p>
<p>Every new update we do will contain a new economy. In this particular case, we decided not to put any of the content exclusive to the new economy, but in the future, we may decide to do that before early access is over. But generally speaking, there's probably going to be more content in these Path of Exile 2 updates than what you would have seen in Path of Exile 1 leagues in the past, just because we're finishing the game at the same time. That should result in a lot. In this particular case, our focus was really more on endgame and making sure there were lots of new encounters to find there. While we did add the wisps throughout the game and we've also added a strongbox&nbsp;and things like that, we didn't think it quite rose to the level of being able to make it exclusive to the league and to be able to call it a challenge league in the way that we would have done in the past.</p>
<p>The wisps were the closest thing to a new league mechanic here, but as I said, we decided not to make them exclusive this time. I am keen to do exclusive challenge league content for future expansions before the end of early access just because when we do that, we can also decide whether we want to remove them, change them, or mess around with them. That's our plan, but honestly, we'll see because, ultimately, everything comes down to the degree to which we want to feel like we're addressing the concerns that people have online.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, having plus level link levels to skills feels like a must since it gives such a large power boost for one mod. Is it intentional? Are there any changes coming to it?</strong></p>
<p>It is intentional and it's exactly the same as having increased physical damage on weapons. There are certain mods that are more powerful than others; that's part of the fun of finding them. It's one of those things, just like how you need run speed on boots. There are certain things that you want to be able to find. You need chase mods in order to make the bad mods feel better. It's just part of the design.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans to add a higher difficulty mode for existing acts?</strong></p>
<p>No, because even the fact that we have two difficulties right now is not the final stage. We'll be removing that difficulty the moment we have the rest of the campaign. The higher-difficulty content is the endgame content, which is already done. While it all looks unique, it technically remixes all the act content and reuses the bosses in different ways. It's not like you don't have high-level content to do; it's just that it's done in a way that feels different from the campaign.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There is actually a chance of not being able to add all classes in time. I suspect we're probably not going to have all of them for full release, but we'll see. It depends on how things go and where things end. Obviously, I'd like to get them all in, but they do take a long time to make. The most important thing for the full release is that we have the full campaign and there's all the content that we need. It's not like we've got a shortage of classes. If we didn't have one or two of them for the full release, that wouldn't be the end of the world. We'll try to get them all in, but if we don't, then whatever.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will all the remaining classes be added to early access before release, or could some&nbsp;be held back for the full launch of Path of Exile 2?</strong></p>
<p>There is actually a chance of that. I suspect we're probably not going to have all of them for full release, but we'll see. It depends on how things go and where things end. Obviously, I'd like to get them all in, but they do take a long time to make. The most important thing for the full release is that we have the full campaign, and there's all the content that we need. It's not like we've got a shortage of classes. If we didn't have one or two of them for the full release, that wouldn't be the end of the world. We'll try to get them all in, but if we don't, then whatever.</p>
<p><strong>The last time, you mentioned that Path of Exile 1 will continue receiving updates as long as it has players. Are the current player numbers sufficient to justify ongoing development?</strong></p>
<p>So it absolutely is. The issue with Path of Exile 1 development really just comes down to studio bandwidth from the perspective of designers who know how to make Path of Exile. We don't have a huge number of them. Obviously, we have a bunch of people who work on the game, but in terms of game director tier people who are able to lead a project like that, we don't have enough to the point where we can just be, okay, you just go off and you do your thing.</p>
<p>Mark and I have to keep an eye on it. For that reason, it's been a challenge to get the structure in place so that we can actually get both games rolling. Right now, I think we're getting to that point, but it certainly was a bit rough around the launch of Path of Exile 2's early access where POE 1 stuff got quite paged in order to make POE2 happen. We're going to continue to do that stuff.</p>
<p>With regard to your question, our company had both games in the top 20 player concurrency for Steam at one point a few weeks ago. I'd certainly say that both games have their place with<br>
regard to player popularity. It's definitely worth continuing to support Path of Exile 1.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any mana cost changes?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I don't even know what they are because, as I said, everything's just been rebalanced. Some will go up; some will go down, and some will go sideways. For the specifics, you're going to have to wait for the patch notes to see.</p>
<p><strong>Will Path of Exile 2 and its predecessor alternate new seasons from now on, or will there be another Path of Exile 2 season after Dawn of the Hunt?</strong></p>
<p>There will be another Path of Exile 1 season between Dawn of the Hunt and the next Path of Exile 2 season for sure. As for how it works going forward, we're keen to alternate them, but it's going to come down to the realities of development and what happens. Certainly the eventual goal by the time everything is rolling and working smoothly, it will definitely be the case that they're going to alternate like that, but I can imagine scenarios during early access of POE 2 where POE 1 might end up with a delay here or there.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans for the endgame map to have an option to place bookmarks or better navigation changes?</strong></p>
<p>We actually do have plans for this. Unfortunately, they didn't make it for this update. We have UI designs. I have a feeling you might see them in 0.21. We definitely know that that's an issue, but our UI guys were quite busy. We'll get to it.</p>
<p><strong>With the Atlas tree expanding, are we going to have more points for the Atlas tree?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you are. Actually, I don't remember the number now. Both the corrupted Nexus objective and the unique map objectives get you Atlas points. Both the tree and the points have expanded.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Grinding Gear Games has unveiled Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt, a huge free expansion to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed action RPG title</a> currently in early access. The expansion launches next week on all platforms; don't forget to also check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press roundtable Q&amp;A with Game Director Jonathan Rogers</a>, who revealed even more details about the expansion and the game's future.</p>
<p>Dawn of the Hunt introduces the first new class since the early access of Path of Exile 2: the huntress. She is a spear-wielding warrior born into a society with strict traditions. She was exiled from her homeland after using her powers to defend her. She specializes in both melee and ranged combat, dashing into and out of battle. Spears have extended range and a short dash, but unlike other melee weapons, you can also throw them. In order to make a hybrid ranged/melee character work, the developers had to think about ways to make it fun to both enter and exit the melee range. The first skill players will get as a Huntress is Whirling Slash.</p>
<p>As well as striking in a circle the player, the skill creates a whirlwind that blinds enemies. Leaving the whirlwind will make it explode, and the more Whirling Slash is used, the bigger the explosion gets. Once out of melee, the Huntress can follow up with something ranged. She can whip the spear around to shoot twisters towards foes. These twisters bounce off walls and can hit enemies multiple times. Twisters can also be thrown inside a whirlwind to shoot out extra tornadoes that do way more damage. In her off-hand, the Huntress will hold a buckler which allows her to Parry.</p>
<p>While holding that down, the character will counterattack any incoming attack from nearby monsters, stunning them. Additionally, the monsters will take extra attack damage from your follow-up strike. Some of the specific class skills have been designed to be used after a Parry.</p>
<p>Disengage is a skill that does a quick jump back, damaging enemies in front of you. It can be used to interrupt other actions like dodge roll. If you use it against a parried enemy, it causes an explosion and gives you a frenzy charge. However, the Huntress cannot Parry too much, lest they get stunned and possibly killed.</p>
<p>The Huntress also has a variety of elemental spear throw attacks. Lightning Spear bounces lightning between your foes. Explosive Spears can be thrown into the ground and detonate after a while, incinerating anyone caught in the blast. All spear throws can also be empowered by frenzy charges. For example, Explosive Spears will cause an even larger explosion and leave fire on the ground. These empowered versions can activate even more combos. Using Whirling Slash off a ground fire will suck it into the whirlwind, adding fire to the explosion. Using Twisters inside a fire whirlwind will shoot out fire tornadoes as well, and you can do similar combos with ice and lightning, too.</p>
<p>A key aspect of hunting is exhausting your foes by causing blood loss. Rake dashes towards your target and unleashes a deadly slash opening up wounds on your enemies. You can follow up with Disengage and watch them bleed out as they run towards you. On the monsters health bar, you can see how much blood loss the enemy has experienced. The Huntress has skills to take advantage of this: for example, using Blood Hunt will thrust forward and cause a bloody explosion. the more blood loss, the bigger the explosion. Thunderous Leap will allow you to jump onto and explode any Spears either in the ground or in your enemies.</p>
<p>As well as hunting animals, the Huntress also has the ability to work with them. While fighting any beast, you have the ability to tame it and use it as a companion. You can only have one companion at a time, but it will keep the mods that were on it. Try to find a rare beast with good mods to take full advantage of your ability to tame. There's a huge amount of synergy between ranged and melee options. There are a total of 22 new skills available for the Huntress.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ritualist-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The first Ascension class you could choose is the Ritualist, which has embraced the darker side and harnessed the power of animal sacrifice and plague. The Corrupted Life Force skill causes all enemies around you to grow volatile blood boils on their skin. When those enemies are slain, the boils will burst, spreading corrupted blood to all enemies around them. The Ritualist also excels in taking advantage of magical trinkets. The Unfurled Finger skill allows you to equip an additional ring on a finger. Taking Mystic Attunement increases the bonuses of all the rings and Amulets you have equipped. You can even cut your own hand sacrificing some of your own blood to empower yourself.</p>
<p>The Amazon Ascension is for those looking to hunt more than just beasts. Trained as a guard to the most important Elders, the Amazon will use more traditional fighting techniques mastered to perfection. The Predatory Instinct skill will cause you to reveal weaknesses in the defenses of rare and unique enemies, allowing you to deal more damage. You can see those weak spots represented on their life bars. While using Elemental Infusion, any charges you consume will infuse your weapon with elemental power, causing any projectile attacks to explode on impact. The Critical Strike skill is as simple as it sounds: it takes your accuracy and gives it to you as Critical Strike chance.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt also brings three new Ascendancy classes for other classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lich (Witch) -</strong> The Lich tears their own soul apart, becoming a master of undeath and chaos. The Lich is a master of Chaos and Curses who can use her own life to enhance her Energy.</li>
<li><strong>Smith of Kitava (Warrior) -</strong> The Smith of Kitava forges weapons of destruction in fire and suffering. Embrace sheer power and take Smithing skills to greater heights by resonating with the insatiable one - Kitava.</li>
<li><strong>Tactician (Mercenary) -</strong> The mercenary Tactician brings military-grade brutality to the battlefield. As a former trained Blackguard Elite, the Tactician is able to decimate the monsters of Wraeclast while earning a healthy income at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The expansion also adds two new skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raise Spectre -</strong> This skill lets you trap and summon the souls of almost any monster in the game. With hundreds of monster variants in Path of Exile 2, expect endless experimentation to find the perfect undead army.</li>
<li><strong>Summon Rhoa Mount -</strong> Call forth a Rhoa to fight by your side or mount it to move at full speed while attacking. But beware, taking too much damage can knock you off, leaving you vulnerable to a brutal fate.</li>
</ul>
<p>This expansion also brings a massive overhaul to character development by adding over 100 new Support Gems to enhance build diversity. Support gems add a variety of interesting effects to your existing skills, modifying them in game-changing ways. For example, Haemocrystals turn bleed effects into explosive Vaal crystals, and Caltrops allow your existing skills to litter the battlefield with slowing hazards.</p>
<p>A big focus of the expansion is to expand on the endgame. There are over a hundred new unique items, ensuring high-level characters have more thrilling bounty to chase. New crafting tools have also been introduced as rewards across many areas of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 20 new runes have been added allowing you to craft new mods onto your gear</li>
<li>Runes now scale with multiple tiers, allowing for stronger mods that remain viable in the endgame.</li>
<li>We're expanding crafting options further by introducing more specialized socketable mods, with the first wave arriving in an upcoming content update.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more. The so-called Azmeri Spirit has made itself present in Wraeclast. When approached, these wisps will flee, and monsters coming into contact will be infused by it, making them more powerful. Wisps will also find and possess Rare or Unique monsters, granting them powerful new abilities, and powerful new rewards. There are twelve distinct types of wisp, each with their own mechanics and rewards.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt adds eight new Maps to the game, offering fresh challenges and rewards. In each case, players will have interesting new encounters to look forward to, such as&nbsp; being forced to fight mirrored Rare monsters in a shifting, warped reality in The Fractured Lake, or being thrust into the wild Ezomyte Forests of The Phaaryl Megaliths where rune-carved stones surge with energy. Survive the storm-fueled gauntlet of deadly boss waves, and you’ll earn full boss rewards and exclusive Runes.</p>
<p>The update introduces four new Unique Strongboxes, each with deadly mechanics and valuable rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ogham's Legacy features a rune-carved stone and a slain creature that, when activated, revives as a powerful Rare. Each defeat triggers another resurrection with added modifiers making the fight progressively more difficult, but also more rewarding.</li>
<li>Ixchel’s Torment harnesses ancient Vaal thaumaturgy, unleashing Chaos-empowered guardians to protect a powerful artifact. Victors will be rewarded with a unique item featuring a specific Corrupted outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essences also received major upgrades, with four new Corrupted Essences - Hysteria, Delirium, Horror, and Insanity - offering new combat mechanics and powerful new crafting outcomes, such as guaranteed double Enchantments when using a Vaal Orb on belts.</p>
<p>Corruption has continued to spread throughout Wraeclast and has formed into larger and larger zones. In the center of each one lies a Corrupted Nexus, the home of three new terrifying bosses, amalgamations of Corruption itself. Upon defeating these bosses, any remaining areas within the zone of Corruption will become cleansed. Cleansed Maps have additional new monsters, a new boss, and their own set of Modifiers and rewards.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt also introduces Rogue Exiles - others like you who have been exiled and are openly hostile. They will challenge you in a fight to the death. These NPCs have the ability to Dodge Roll and avoid your abilities with smart pathfinding, smart targeting, and much more action-packed gameplay. Rogue Exiles use the same skills available to players, and even the same items. They aren't just dressed up in those items; they know how to take advantage of the Uniques they are using, which, of course, will be available for players once they have prevailed.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's a significant rebalance of the endgame. The number of towers has been drastically reduced, but they have been made much more powerful. Tablets now affect twice as many areas and running higher tier Maps in Towers increases this number further still. In addition, each Tower will be able to consume up to three Tablets at once. These changes greatly reduce the amount of busy work required in the endgame while improving the player's ability to use them. On top of that, Towers can now spawn with all mechanics, and have their own new Bosses.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt will launch on Friday, April 4.</p>
