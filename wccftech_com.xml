			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' launch has been extremely successful in the United States, where it became the best-selling game of the month of February and the current best-selling game of the year in a single day of availability.</p>
<p>According to data shared today by Circana (NPD), the latest entry in the series by CAPCOM was the overall best-selling premium game in the United States, topping the sales charts of every platform it has released on - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam - followed by two other February releases, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">Civilization VII</a>. While the game sold great on all platforms, it was a smashing success on Steam, as the PC ecosystem accounts for more than half of the title's total dollar sales.&nbsp; With the game also being the current best-selling game of the year in the United States, it definitely looks like the first proper, simultaneous PC and console release for the series paid off big time.</p>

That Monster Hunter Wilds has been a smashing success, there was no doubt, as CAPCOM itself reported to have sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">eight million copies in only three days</a>, becoming the fastest-selling game in the publisher's long history. A success that is completely deserved, as the game is, despite some shortcomings, incredibly fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide.</p>

			<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 Pro upgrade is among the largest we have seen so far, according to a new in-depth analysis of the soon-to-be-released new entry in the series.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the one thing that elevates the Assassin's Creed Shadows experience on the PS5 Pro over the base model is how Performance Mode leverages the power of the system to deliver 60 FPS gameplay, though with some drops in certain scenarios, with the ray-traced global illumination available only in Quality Mode on the base system. As seen in the footage below, RTGI makes quite a bit of a difference, even when, on both base and Pro systems, the game features similar image quality, internal resolution, which is only marginally higher on PlayStation 5 Pro, and graphics settings. Other than sporting RTGI in Performance Mode, Assassin's Creed Shadows on PlayStation 5 Pro features substantial improvements from added specular detail from additional ray tracing. Interestingly enough, the Playstation 5 Pro version also doesn't seem to be using the PSSR upscaler, as it exhibits visual artifacts more in line with analytical upscaling than machine-learning-based upscaling.</p>

<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't push the boundaries of the series' open-world RPG formula first seen in Origins, it delivers solid enhanced by some of the best visuals seen in open-world games that is worth experiencing for all fans of the series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
