			<p>Immediately after Donald Trump announced his proposed tariffs that will go into effect this coming Saturday, April 5, and then a second wave on Wednesday, April 9, there was speculation across the video game industry as to how this would impact games.</p>
<p>So far, the sentiment is that these tariffs will have a huge impact on the video game industry, and the latest report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/esa-trump-tariffs">Game File</a> reveals that the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) expects the tariffs to have "<em>a real and detrimental impact on the video game industry.</em>"</p>
<p>Game File spoke to Aubrey Quinn, senior vice president at the ESA, who said that gaming hardware, for example, will be hit on multiple fronts, not just from the tariffs levied against countries like Vietnam, China, and Cambodia.</p>
<p>"<em>Any one product that a consumer would buy is likely to be subject to many of the tariffs announced, all compounded on top of one another,</em>" said Quinn.</p>
<p>It was already speculated that the tariffs on Vietnam and Cambodia, in particular, could potentially impact the pricing of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but Quinn's point is that there's more to gaming hardware that comes from other countries beyond Vietnam and Cambodia, which means that the base 10% tariff levied against all imports to the United States will only add on to the already high tariffs on specific countries.</p>
<p>Quinn did add, though, that the ESA remains "<em>optimistic that there will be a solution that doesn’t damage U.S. industries, ours included, and doesn’t hurt U.S. consumers</em>."</p>
<p>As we previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad believes that Nintendo won't raise the price of its new console anytime soon, at least on the specific question of the pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we could still see things shift with these tariffs for the better, with the potential still remaining for a deal to be reached with exemptions for certain products, a lower tariff, or no tariffs at all being levied. Those deals, however, will take some time to set up with each impacted country, and in the meantime, we could still see the video game industry take a serious hit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-isnt-dead-and-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2025-rumor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to two reliable leakers for news about Apex Legends, the long-awaited Titanfall 3 is not dead, and it is currently in the works at Respawn.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/YOROTSUKI_/status/1907780125996745064">Yorotsuki</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Osvaldatore/status/1907780126626164993">Osvaldatore</a>, two leakers with a solid reputation for Apex Legends leaks, took to X to reinvigorate players' hopes that Titanfall 3 is not lying in a ditch somewhere (or the digital equivalent on EA's servers).</p>
<p>Yorotsuki was a little clearer than Osvladatore, claiming that Respawn is working on the game and that it will be revealed during The Game Awards 2025 showcase set for December 2025. Osvladatore simply posted a graphic of the game's alleged logo.</p>
<p>The Titanfall franchise is arguably one of the best franchises in video game history that got dealt the worst hand possible. The first Titanfall game definitely wasn't perfect, but it brought a new and exciting flavor to the FPS genre that was dominated by Call of Duty and Battlefield.</p>
<p>Then, Titanfall 2 stepped everything up, and if EA hadn't aided in Titanfall 2 being overshadowed by Battlefield 1 launching right beside it in EA's effort to keep up with Call of Duty launching its annual release, Infinite Warfare, in 2016, then there's a solid chance Titanfall 2's story ends differently.</p>
<p>It still has what is regarded as one of the best single-player campaigns, not just in a first-person shooter, but in any game in gaming's history. And the rise and sustained popularity of Apex Legends continues to be proof that there's no other franchise that has mastered movement in a first-person shooter quite like what Respawn was able to accomplish with Titanfall.</p>
<p>That's just a part of what has made Titanfall 3 a topic its fans bring up nearly as often as Bloodborne fans cry out for a sequel or remake. It's also why Respawn's chief executive officer and one of the original creatives behind Titanfall, Vince Zampella, has had to answer questions about Titanfall 3 time and again.</p>
<p>Even though Zampella has previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-id-love-it-but-it-has-to-be-the-right-thing-at-the-right-time-says-respawn-ceo/">stated that the studio is not working on Titanfall 3</a>, the reality of the video game industry, of which EA is no exception, is that things can change on a dime. Just last month, another multiplayer FPS game Respawn was<a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/"> incubating was canceled</a>, so it's entirely possible that the cancelation of that project has led to Titanfall 3 being kicked up again, which is where today's rumor comes from.</p>
<p>There are plenty of unknowns here, but crazier things have happened during The Game Awards than a franchise that's beloved by millions coming back from the dead.</p>
