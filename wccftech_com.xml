			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/">La Quimera</a> is a new story-driven, sci-fi co-operative shooter from the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, now known as Reburn. We now have a release date set for this new shooter.</p>
<p>It'll be arriving on PC on Steam at the end of this month, on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2025</strong>, though anyone who is keen to try the game as soon as possible can request to be a part of a closed beta test the studio is hosting for 24 hours beginning this Saturday, April 12, 2025. You can register your interest for the beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>La Quimera takes players to a dystopian version of Latin America in the year 2064, where most of the global systems we know today have collapsed, and humanity continues on in fractured segments around the world. It's a confusing and chaotic time, but it's also the golden age for private mercenary forces, which is where you come in.</p>
<p>That setting is also what lends the game to its cooperative experience while also being a story-driven game. You can play through the story with two friends alongside you, taking advantage of all the futuristic gadgets you'll have, like exoskeletons that make you stronger and faster and weapons that are unlike any of the killing machines we have today.</p>
<p>Along with announcing the release date, Reburn also revealed a new gameplay trailer, which you can check out below.</p>

<p>Dmytro Lymar, Reburn's chief executive officer and co-founder, also added in the announcement that "<em>Our Reburn team can't wait to finally share our hard work and vision for La Quimera on April 25. </em><em>[...] As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn't be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we're profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience."</em></p>
