			<p>Today, Hazelight Studios announced that their highly anticipated new adventure game Split Fiction will be playable through crossplay across all platforms. This greatly enhances any player's ability to play with their friends since Split Fiction, like Hazelight's prior games, is co-op only.</p>
<p>But there's more. While the studio's previous games also implemented free passes for friends, enticing a casual gamer to play with a more hardcore gamer who bought the game, this time there's an evolution of that.</p>
<p>Through the Friend's Pass Trial, even if neither player owns a copy of Split Fiction, they can still experience a trial version using the Friend's Pass. Once they both download and launch the Friend's Pass version of the game, they will unlock the opportunity to invite each other to play the opening stages of the game together. If they like the game, they can progress if just one of them purchases a full copy of the game, which will be priced at $49.99 when it launches on March 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app.</p>

<p>Josef Fares and his team garnered widespread acclaim, especially with their latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won several Game of the Year awards. Split Fiction is also about a duo, although a very different one.</p>
<p>This time, players will step into the roles of Mio and Zoe. They're both writers, although one writes sci-fi, and the other fantasy, and they have wildly different personalities. They both find themselves trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. Relying on each other to escape with their memories intact, they work together to master a variety of skills and overcome various challenges as they jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds in what Hazelight promises will be an unexpected tale of friendship. The full PC system requirements for Split Fiction are available below.</p>
