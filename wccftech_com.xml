			<p>The FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/06/ftc-sends-126-million-refunds-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items-reopens-claims?utm_source=govdelivery">announced today</a> that it will send refunds to players who made unwanted purchases in Fortnite, with the refunds totaling over $126 million. The agency will also reopen the process for players and their parents or guardians to make claims for further compensation from now until <strong>July 9, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This latest batch of refunds is a follow-up from the 629,344 refunds issued in <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-users-refunds-are-being-issued-by-the-ftc-following-settlement-of-fortnite-case/">December 2024</a> over what the FTC described as "<em>deceptive</em>" practices from Epic that led to players making unwanted purchases in the first place.</p>
<p>While the agency disclosed the average refund amount in December to be $114 per person, it does not disclose what the average refund will be this time around, perhaps due to the fact that there's still time for people to submit claims. Beginning today, however, either through PayPal or a check, the FTC will begin delivering <strong>969,173</strong> refunds.</p>
<p>If you selected to receive a check on your claim form, the FTC recommends you cash it within 90 days. PayPal recipients should redeem their refund within 30 days.</p>
<p>Including today's batch of refunds, the FTC has now provided players with more than <strong>$200 million</strong> as part of the FTC's punitive action against Epic Games.</p>
<p>This claims process began in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-announces-claims-process-fortnite-players-who-were-charged-unwanted-items">September 2023</a> and is part of the $245 million Epic was fined for its practices regarding microtransactions in Fortnite. The first claims process lasted from September 2023 to January 2024, though if you missed that window, you now have an extra two weeks to get your cut of the refunds from Epic Games.</p>
