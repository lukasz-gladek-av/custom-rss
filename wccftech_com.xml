			<p>A few hours ago, renowned developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed it was forced to perform a round of layoffs. However, the new Tomb Raider game project is unaffected.</p>



<p>Here's the whole message that was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Today, we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.</em></p>



<p><em>To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.</em> <em>To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision.</em></p>



<p>The studio had been collaborating with The Initiative on the Perfect Dark remake that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> last month, so this could still be related to that decision taken by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics, a studio headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been in the industry for over 33 years and is known primarily for Legacy of Kain, Gex, and of course, Tomb Raider. More recently, it released Marvel's Avengers, which largely failed to gain any traction despite the IP.</p>



<p>In April 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the studio was working on a new installment in Lara Croft's franchise, powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Crystal Dynamics' proprietary Foundation Engine. A few months later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Amazon Games would publish the new title. Amazon later acquired the movie and series rights, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">vague goals to create an interconnected universe</a> that would also include the new games. We now know that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been brought on to write and produce the series that will eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air on Prime Video</a>.</p>



<p>As for the new Tomb Raider game, we last <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-shown-in-the-not-too-distant-future-says-amazon-games-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> something official from Amazon Games head Christoph Hartmann, who said it wouldn't be too long before the project was shown to the public. That was in June 2024, though. Hopefully, we will get at least a trailer at the upcoming The Game Awards in December.</p>
