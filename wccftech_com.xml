			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">laid off</a> around 9K employees in the latest round of cuts, affecting 4% of the company's total workforce. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Seattle Times</a>, this is all part of the company's mandate to trim and make room for increased spending in AI infrastructure. </p>



<p>The report says it's not quite like one game developer from Halo Studios reckoned last week when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Microsoft was doing its damnedest to replace personnel with AI agents. However, Microsoft is indeed cutting costs as much as possible to accommodate its planned expenditures of over $80 billion in this area, a $25 billion increase over the previous year. These investments are seen as more necessary than ever by Microsoft, with Open AI <a href="https://wccftech.com/sam-altman-says-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-as-openai-starts-eating-palantirs-lunch-and-grows-increasingly-territorial-with-microsoft/">showing its fangs lately in what has become a complicated partnership</a>.</p>



<p>However, the cuts are weighing heavily on the company's reputation in other areas, such as gaming. Microsoft spent dozens of billions on gaming acquisitions, such as Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, to expand its Game Pass subscription service library. Still, the user base didn't grow nearly as much as hoped, and analysts are now <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a> that Xbox might have bet on the wrong horse, since subscriptions do not hold the same appeal for gamers as they do for music or TV/film fans.</p>



<p>Moreover, the industry's reaction to these latest layoffs was more scathing than ever before. Fourteen months after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down Tango Gameworks</a>, which had released a successful and critically acclaimed game (Hi-Fi Rush), Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled</a> a promising online looter shooter from ZeniMax Online Studios, the makers of The Elder Scrolls Online, one of the gaming division's top performers. Former developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">railed against </a>the decision, saying that the project was finally heading in a great direction, and there have been rumors that even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a blast while playing a vertical slice of Project Blackbird</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>The only logical conclusion is that the executive did not wish to cancel the game himself, but may have received a mandate from above. Finishing Project Blackbird would have cost quite a bit, as it was just about to ramp up to production with an estimated late 2028 launch window, and Microsoft had other priorities - chiefly, bolstering its AI infrastructure. For gamers and developers alike, though, it's a shame.</p>

			<p>During the Anime Expo in Los Angeles, California, CD PROJEKT RED and studio TRIGGER <a href="https://x.com/edgerunners/status/1941255538047951061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 is officially in development. This is a major turnaround from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-isnt-getting-a-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement released in October 2022</a>. Edgerunners 2 will be a standalone anime series of 10 episodes set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>Hugo Award-winning writer Bartosz Sztybor, showrunner, story writer, and producer on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>David’s story might be over, but there’s plenty more to discover in Night City. And to again have the legendary animation studio TRIGGER along for the ride makes us at CD PROJEKT RED so excited to introduce a raw, real chronicle of redemption and revenge, something unlike what we’ve done before.</em></p>



<p>Sztybor will be joined by lead character designer Kanno Ichigo (Promare, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners) and Masahiko Otsuka (Gurren Lagann, Promare), who will be responsible for the screenplay adaptation. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 will air on Netflix at an unspecified date.</p>



<p>As you might recall, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners launched in September 2022 to rave reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it enjoys an enviable 100% fresh rating. More importantly, it was the first real spark to <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-continues-its-edgerunners-fueled-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reignite interest</a> in CD PROJEKT RED's Cyberpunk 2077. The studio wisely timed Patch 1.6 to launch alongside the Netflix anime series, which added the Wardrobe feature, cross-progression between different platforms, three new side missions (Gigs), five new melee weapons, and six new firearms, in addition to some light Edgerunners-related content and tons of fixes. Cyberpunk 2077 player numbers spiked, and the sentiment around the game started turning around.</p>



<p>It is presently unclear whether CD PROJEKT RED will go to the trouble of making more Cyberpunk 2077 content to go with this series. It seems unlikely, though, as they are now deep into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">production of The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For all the changes that <a href="https://duneawakening.com/">Funcom</a> has made to the world of Dune for the purposes of telling their own story in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">Dune: Awakening</a>, the large-scale multiplayer survival game is very faithful to plenty of key aspects of Dune lore.</p>



<p>The Fremen might have been eradicated in Funcom's version of Dune, but their technologies and impact are everywhere, as is the everlasting and iconic weapon, the Crysknife. </p>



<p>You can actually make your own Crysknife in Dune: Awakening, and this guide will show you how to do it. Unfortunately, this is one of the areas where Funcom made some significant changes to the lore that make the weapon more of a collectors item than anything else.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-how-to-craft-a-crysknife-guide">Dune: Awakening - How To Craft A Crysknife Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-ingredients-and-requirements">Ingredients and Requirements</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Before getting into the ingredients required for crafting your own Crysknife in Dune: Awakening, you'll need to have completed the Fourth Trial of Aql. Even if you have the ingredients, the option to craft an Unfixed Crysknife (which is the only kind you can craft) will not appear. Once you've completed the trial, the option to craft a crysknife will appear in your crafting menu.</p>



<p>The basics of crafting a Crysknife are easy, since you only need two items. One is Plant Fiber, the basic grass you pick up practically anywhere on Arrakis in order to craft healing items, and a bevy of other useful pieces of kit. The other, you might've been able to guess if you're a fan of the Dune universe, is the tooth of a sandworm. </p>



<p>That is a little more difficult to acquire, but not too much more difficult. All you need to do is get swallowed up by Shai-Hulud himself. When you respawn after giving yourself up to the worm and dying, you'll find the tooth of a worm in your inventory. It's possible that you'll need to do this twice, since there is also a cutscene that you'll see if you've never died to a sandworm before. </p>



<figure></figure>



<div><p>Critically, though, before you head out to into the desert to jump on some drumsand, make sure you've stored everything in a chest or storage unit in your base. Make sure you have absolutely no equipment on you whatsoever, not in your backpack, not on your person, nothing. You'll respawn, but the equipment you had on you when Shai-Hulud grabbed you for a snack won't. That will stay in his belly and will be lost forever. </p><p>This does not apply to quest items, though, so you don't need to run around emptying your inventory of items you can't be rid of without completing quests if you're hankering to make yourself a Crysknife as soon as possible. Everything else besides quest items that you can't take out of your inventory or off your person, is viable to be lost if you leave it with you when you go out worm-tooth gathering.</p></div>



<p>Once you have 1 Plant Fiber and 1 Worm Tooth, you'll be able to craft a Crysknife.</p>



<h3 id="h-sadly-the-crysknife-is-not-a-viable-weapon">Sadly, the Crysknife is not a Viable Weapon</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the one hand, the Crysknife is one of the most powerful weapons in the game, living up to the reputation it is given in the original Dune books. It deals 191.6 points of damage, which is sure to spill the water of anyone willing to stand in your way while you wield the ancient weapon.</p>



<div><p>The problem is that it's incredibly fragile, which is where Funcom's changes come in. It will break after that first swing. It has absolutely no durability and cannot be repaired. This is even the case for any potential Crysknives you may obtain after certain story beats, which is all I'll say without going into spoiler territory. Dune-heads will know that Crysknives are praised for their durability in the books, but that's not the case here. </p><p>It's an incredibly powerful weapon, living up to the legend, but, in Funcom's version of Dune, due to the eradication of the Fremen, it seems that no one knows how to make one that can withstand more than one strike. Or perhaps making it incredibly brittle is just Funcom's way of ensuring you're not walking around with a weapon that does 191.6 damage fairly early in the game. Or, it's a bit of both.</p></div>



<div><p>So yes, you can craft a Crysknife, and just like in the lore, it's not permitted to leave your side, meaning that it'll become a fixed item in your backpack until it's destroyed. Yes, it will still look cool, and yes, it's nice that Funcom has them in the game at all. </p><p>Unfortunately, it's not really something you use unless you want to deliver a powerful one-shot blow to an enemy, whether at a particularly significant moment in Dune: Awakening's story, or if you have some personal vendetta against an enemy that's made you particularly annoyed. You could try it in PvP scenarios, though, due to how hairy those can get, you're better off not leaving yourself unarmed after one strike.</p></div>
