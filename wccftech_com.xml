			<p>A new update for Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">pushed to all platforms today</a>, adding an FOV slider for console players, stability and performance improvements for all platforms, UI, audio, visual, gear refinements, and more.</p>



<p>As the latest entry in Gearbox's shooter series, even with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical acclaim from multiple outlets</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/">major commercial success right at launch</a>, the story of Borderlands 4 isn't about everyone grabbing their own copies and having a blast. </p>



<p>It's about the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-developer-says-fixing-pc-performance-is-top-priority/">poor technical performance at launch</a>, Gearbox boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">Randy Pitchford's bizarre approach of antagonizing players upset at the state of the game</a>, and, as of two days ago, how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game has been indefinitely delayed</a> while Gearbox works on the versions already in players' hands.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today's update, and every update that'll come after it, is slowly trying to chip away at that narrative and turn it around from 'Borderlands 4 is broken but fun' to 'Borderlands 4 is fun.'</p>



<p>Starting with stability updates and performance improvements, which are key elements of today's update, and will likely remain key elements of every update going forward. Character animations have been updated, issues of frame rate hitching and crashes have been addressed, and several issues where players didn't get the rewards they were owed from completing an objective have been fixed. </p>



<p>For console players, an FOV slider has finally been added, and for all players, there's a series of balance changes for each of the Vault Hunters and several gameplay elements.</p>



<p>It's all a start, of course, but the work on Borderlands 4 is far from done. Hopefully, it doesn't take Gearbox too much longer to fix the myriad of issues the game launched with. Though with how many problems the game had, it feels like we're in this for the long haul.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-debuts-battlefield-6-campaign-trailer/">we got our first look at the campaign mode</a> in Battlefield 6 during Sony's State of Play presentation. Today, gameplay from the upcoming Portal mode in Battlefield 6 has appeared online, and it's a major showcase of just how far players will be able to push this new Portal.</p>



<p>If you're unfamiliar, the Portal in Battlefield 6 is where players can access other player-made game modes and levels that drastically change everything about what it is to play Battlefield 6. It's a full-blown creative mode where you can make seemingly anything you can think of using assets and models already in Battlefield, and this year's version of it seems to be more expansive than ever before.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer for the mode from EA and Battlefield Studios that was <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1971228205387317485">posted to X (formerly Twitter)</a> shows a bit of what this new tier of level-crafting potential looks like, with quick shots of the editor and how granular players can get.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6RGo76uyTk&amp;t=5s">YouTuber JackFrags</a> shows off some of the Battlefield Studios-made modes that really show off how you can just create whatever you want in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. Want to recreate Counter-Strike? Check. Want to create your own Battlefield version of Call of Duty Zombies? Check. Want to make a version of Only Up where you're competing against other squads to race to the top and hold that position? Check. Racing F-16s, creating your own conquest maps, re-drawing out-of-bounds lines, adjusting every detail of the gameplay experience? Check.</p>

<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Portal Gameplay and Impressions..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6RGo76uyTk?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's far more freedom than we've seen in previous Battlefield games, and while the modes created by Battlefield Studios shown in the video are just a few of the more obvious options (like a Zombies mode or racing vehicles), you can only imagine the kinds of modes players will make once they get their hands on it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to find out, as Battlefield 6 arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming October 10, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-baby-steps-sworn-and-more-among-the-10-new-titles-joining-geforce-now-library.1308942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's yet another GeForce NOW Thursday, with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-mecha-break/">a new batch of games announced</a> as joining the ever-growing library of games available to stream through NVIDIA's cloud service. This week, 10 games are joining the cloud library, while two games already available get a boost by officially becoming streamable with NVIDIA's new RTX 5080 graphics cards powering them.</p>



<p>The highlights in this week's batch of new GeForce NOW games include Mecha Break from developer Amazing Seasun Games, with the multiplayer PvPvE title joining the service with support from DLSS 4, letting you enjoy the 3v3 or 6v6 matches at high frame rates.</p>



<p>Other highlights come from new indie titles on the scene, including Baby Steps, a game from the makers of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. Baby Steps released earlier this week on September 23, after the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">slightly delayed it in order to get out of the way of Hollow Knight Silksong's launch</a>.</p>



<p>If you've not heard of Baby Steps before, it's a physics-based hiking game where you take control of a 35-year-old man-child in a onesie. You control each of his legs separately, and find yourself on a treacherous hike while winding your way through a story that is as weird as it is hilarious. It was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Wccftech's highlights at a Steam Next Fest earlier this year</a>, and the demo is still available if you want to try it out before jumping in.</p>



<p>Another highlight in this week's batch is the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy collection, which includes all 14 episodes from the first three games. </p>



<p>As for the two games that can be played through NVIDIA's new RTX 5080 graphics card, those titles are Remedy Entertainment's excellent Alan Wake 2, and GSC Game World's Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to GeForce NOW this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aztecs: The Last Sun</li>



<li>Baby Steps</li>



<li>CloverPit</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2</li>



<li>Lost Right</li>



<li>Mecha Break</li>



<li>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>



<li>Precedessor</li>



<li>Renown</li>



<li>Sworn</li>
</ul>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-dying-light-the-beast/">13 games joined the cloud library</a>, including the new Claws of Awaji DLC for Assassin's Creed Shadows, Dying Light: The Beast, Jump Space, and Two Point Museum.</p>
