			<p>Today might be all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, but it's still another Thursday in a new week, which means another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday is here, with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-monster-hunter-stories/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud streaming service</a>. This week, seven titles enter the service for the first time, including two games from one franchise, and three games are added to the selection of titles that are RTX 5080-ready.</p>



<p>The two games from one franchise are Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection arriving on March 13, 2026</a>, you'll now be able to play through the first two games using GeForce NOW.</p>



<p>Two other notable games joining the service this week are two new releases, Skate Story and Death Howl, both two of the more interesting indie games to arrive towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining GeForce NOW for the first time this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skate Story (December 8)</li>



<li>Dome Keeper (December 9)</li>



<li>Death Howl (December 9)</li>



<li>RuneQuest: Warlords (December 9)</li>



<li>Everdream Village (December 12)</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as the three games that are now RTX 5080-ready, it's a good week for 4X strategy players and city-sim building players, with the three games being Age of Wonders 4, Cities: Skylines, and Cities: Skylines 2.</p>



<p>Speaking of the RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-adds-8-games-rtx-5080-servers-soon-to-be-live-worldwide/">they are still one region short of being available worldwide, according to the map of their initial rollout</a>. Stockholm has yet to be added, though it is expected to join the rest of the regions where RTX 5080 servers are already available "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, a final mention for The Game Awards, you can play a majority of the nominated games through GeForce NOW, including the heavyweight favourite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and the games that have a shot at stealing GOTY out from its grasp, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>

			<p>We are mere hours away from <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, and just like in previous years, that means there are at least a couple of announcements that have been spoiled right down to the wire. This year, it's IO Interactive accidentally posted a reveal that was almost certainly planned for tonight's show, with a new trailer showcasing one key, but until now, an absent part of 007 First Light - and any major James Bond story - the villain.</p>



<p>The initial post shared by the <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI">official 007 First Light X (formerly Twitter)</a> was quickly taken down, though not before <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/#post-148736176">users on ResetEra</a> were able to capture it and share it far and wide across the internet. Which is how we now know that Bawma, the villain in the James Bond coming-of-agent story in 007 First Light, is played by none other than Lenny Kravitz.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate for IO Interactive that what would have been a pretty solid reveal was shared early accidentally, and surely some poor intern or social media manager at IO Interactive is not having the best day. That said, the early reveal doesn't take away from the fact that 007 First Light appears to be shaping up to be a classic Bond story, through-and-through.</p>



<p>All the way down to Bond being dangled over a pool of some kind of carnivorous animal that the villain keeps as pets. You don't get more Bond than that, and at this point, it seems like all the game's story might be missing is a front shot of James or his love interest (or both) slowly rising from the water after a swim in the ocean and walking onto the beach. </p>



<p>For more on The Game Awards ahead of tonight's show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">you can check out the full list of nominees here</a>, which includes 007 First Light and its nomination for 'Most Anticipated Game.' Not that it'll win next to Grand Theft Auto VI, but it has a nomination all the same. You can also check out a list of every announcement that's been rumoured and/or confirmed to appear at tonight's show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">and all Game Awards information you might need at our full Game Awards hub, here</a>.</p>
