<p>In a recent Steam blog post, the Crosswind Crew also clarified that this is a survival adventure game first and foremost, and that's the focus of this playtest, while an MMO-like layer is planned to be added later.</p>
<p><em>The game's structure is as follows: 'A player-controlled world plus various shared zones'. Each player has their own world in which the main story unfolds. This is a large archipelago comprising a dozen islands, a variety of biomes, resources, enemies and secrets. Most of it is procedurally generated, but some of the key points of interest are hand-crafted. This means that your world won't be the same as your friend's. You have full control over who can visit your world. You can keep it private. Alternatively, you can invite your friends to explore, craft and build with you, or even fight alongside you.</em></p>
<p><em>The MMO part of Crosswind consists of shared zones for various PvE and PvP activities. As you progress through the main story, you will unlock the ability to travel to other locations. These are shared among players. For example, in the upcoming playtest, we will have an early prototype of Tortuga. For now, it's just a place to trade goods and meet other players, but in the future, we'll transform it into a bustling social hub where you can discover new activities, make new friends, and even challenge someone to a duel! Other zones and activities, such as a naval PvP zone, will be added later in the development process, thus expanding the MMO part of Crosswind. We see PvP as an additional way to enjoy the game. It will be optional and take time to implement properly.&nbsp;</em></p>
