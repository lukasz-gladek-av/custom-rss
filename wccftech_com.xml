			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-out-on-may-15-gets-pc-specs-80-price-no-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got its May 15 release date</a> and proper unveiling at the Xbox Developer Direct 2025, with id Software also providing lots more info to the press in a presentation and Q&amp;A that we reported on <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>So far, the game is officially slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. However, <a href="https://xcancel.com/eXtas1stv/status/1882945918074282253?t=4lqcSUs-rJfJsq3p-rVdoA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Spanish leaker eXtas1s</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages will also be released for the newly announced Nintendo Switch 2. According to him, this particular news is being withheld because Nintendo reportedly has to give the green light for any new game coming to the Switch 2 (rather than the original Switch) before an announcement can happen.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't at all surprising. After all, Microsoft has already shown no problems with supporting Nintendo's platforms and is all-in on increasing multiplatform support. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was just featured in a new video Q&amp;A published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Danny Pe√±a's YouTube channel</a>, where the executive once again teased more multiplatform games and expressed excitement for the Switch 2.</p>
<p><em>I want people to be able to experience the games that we build, the services that we offer, on as many devices as we can. Obviously, some of the devices out there, some of the platforms are closed. They don't allow everything that we do to show up on those platforms.</em></p>
<p><em>The thing that I've learned and continue to learn when I'm listening to creators not only our own studios but other teams building games is every creator out there wants to build a game that can</em><br>
<em>find as many players as they want and frankly there aren't many platforms out there that try to build connections to people on so many different screens. It's almost like single platform, single</em><br>
<em>device, single game, and that's kind of the history of our business. We're really taking an approach of we want people to be able to play Xbox on many different screens. Now, not every experience will be the same. </em></p>
<p><em>We obviously love the native experience we have on our own platform and our own hardware and that's something that will continue for us, but we're not going to put walls up around where people can engage with the great games our studios are building or where they can experience Xbox. [...] I</em><br>
<em>want everybody to be able to play on Xbox, and it does mean more of our games shipping on more platforms, not just PlayStation. We love the work that we do with Nintendo, we love what we do with Valve on Steam, and that's going to continue, we'll do more of it.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I was exchanging emails with the CEO of Nintendo. I gave him a big congrats. I said, my old eyes appreciate the larger screen. Nintendo with their innovation and what they mean in this industry, I just always applaud the moves that they make. I think they did like a little flash video. I know we'll get more details over time. I'm really looking forward to supporting them with the games that we have and I just think they're such an important part of this industry. </em></p>
<p><em>Who would ever bet against the success of that team? I mean, they are just masterful at what they do. The Switch is a massive success and I think the Switch 2 will be as well.</em></p>
<p>Really, the only doubt anyone could have about DOOM: The Dark Ages eventually getting on the Switch 2 is on a technical level. Then again, 2016's reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-switch-impressive-subpar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched on the original Switch</a> with the help of Panic Button, which also ported DOOM Eternal to Nintendo's hybrid console. As such, the rumor isn't farfetched at all.</p>
<p>Of course, Switch 2 users won't be able to enjoy all the bells and whistles. On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a>. We still have to wait for confirmation from Nintendo, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to rumors</a>, the Switch 2 should support NVIDIA DLSS 2 Super Resolution plus Ray Reconstruction (3.5) but not Frame Generation.</p>
