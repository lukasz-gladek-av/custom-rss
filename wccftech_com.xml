			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-trailer-gorgeous-eva/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> won't just look like a modern game, but it will also play as one without taking away what makes the original unique, according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>
<p>Speaking with Play magazine, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-dev-says-that-konami-wants-to-make-the-remake-feel-familiar-but-not-old-our-whole-goal-is-to-make-sure-that-it-still-feels-like-the-game-that-you-played-20-years-ago/">GamesRadar</a>, the series producer commented on the remake, saying that their whole game while remaking the third entry in the popular stealth series was to make sure it still felt like the original game without making it feel like an old game. Modernizing gameplay was also somewhat forced by the improved visuals, as some of the original gameplay elements did not fit well with the remade graphics.</p>
<p>The new control scheme featured in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater plays a rather important role in this regard, giving players the chance to experience the game like never before while allowing users to also experience the remake as if it were the original. Any other change was deemed unnecessary, as it would have taken people out of the original experience. The best outcome for the remake, according to Okamura-san, is for long-time fans to still feel nostalgic while playing it.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is still scheduled for a 2024 release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, although at this point, it's clear the game will not be released this year. We will keep you updated as soon as possible on when the game launches, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/?dm_i=2AEH,217EC,AMZC5B,7CM2V,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting is now open</a> for Ultimate Game of the Year and Best Game Adaptation in the Golden Joystick Awards. If you've been wanting an opportunity to vote for your favorite game this year, the Golden Joystick Awards is the perfect opportunity. There are plenty of categories to vote in this year, and you can choose from categories such as Best Indie Game, Studio of the Year, and New Best Audio Design. In total, there are<a href="https://wccftech.com/voting-is-now-open-in-the-42nd-golden-joystick-awards/"> 21 categories</a> to vote in this year, and as mentioned by Daniel Dawkins, this year has seen the most votes ever in their initial round of categories.</p>
<p>In a statement made by Daniel Dawkins, the Content Director of Games, Video, and Digital Events, he said that there has been "a record ten million+ votes in our initial round of categories... Ultimate Game of the Year is our most prestigious award which sits in its own voting window from November 4 to November 8, allowing the judging panel more time to assess the big winter releases."</p>
<p>Although this year has been somewhat quiet in terms of big releases, it has also seen the release of iconic games such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Tekken 8, and even games like Balatro and Satisfactory becoming big hits. In a world where people didn't have faith in the Silent Hill 2 remake, it was released and was done justice by Bloober Team and Konami, who knocked it out of the park.

<ul>
<li>Animal Well</li>
<li>Astro Bot</li>

<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
<li>Satisfactory</li>

<p>In addition to the Ultimate Game of the Year award, you can now vote for the Best Game Adaptation, where you've seen your favorite characters and franchises come to life on the big screen. Here are the nominations for that category in the Golden Joystick Awards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borderlands</li>

<li>Halo Season 2</li>

<p>The Golden Joy Stick Awards will be taking place on November 21, where it will be live via YouTube, Twitch, Steam, Facebook, X, the Future Games Show, GamesRadar, PC Gamer, and TechRadar Gaming, offering you a multitude of places to watch it. If you don't want to sit through the awards, the winners will be announced on social media as the ceremony progresses, so you don't have to miss a beat.</p>
