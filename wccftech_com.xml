			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1891487774571626904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> via the official Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 social channels that the game has sold over two million units in the first two weeks on the market. It had only taken one day to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break one million units sold</a>, although that was obviously with the help of pre-orders.</p>
<p>We don't have an official platform breakdown of the sales. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1771300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Steam data</a>, owners on the largest PC platform are estimated between 1.46 million and 1.72 million, making up the vast majority of the user base. When it comes to the concurrent player peak, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has reached 256K concurrent Steam users, which is just enough to get it on the All-Time Top 50 chart ahead of Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZ_GnoOjxU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week's live-streamed Q3 2024/25 earnings call</a>, Embracer Group CEO Lars Wingefors publicly praised developer Warhorse for their achievement, which is surpassing the publisher's expectations:</p>
<p><em>I'm just so happy and pleased with Warhorse and what they have executed. They <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Embracer in 2019</a>, they had their vision to create a sequel of a fantastic game and we have been allowing them to pull off their vision that they wanted to do and have given them more time and the freedom to really create a masterpiece. The sales are exceeding our expectations and even my a bit higher expectations, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is actually achieving that, so I think it's a 'well done'. I'm really happy to see it. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and the first one for that matter as well, will continue generating substantial revenues for us for many years to come.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Warhorse is <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to release mod tools soon, which should undoubtedly increase the game's longevity on PC. Moreover, there's a whole 2025 roadmap that they already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communicated</a>: barbers, horse racing, and Hardcore Mode in Spring; the Brushes with Death premium DLC in Summer; the Legacy of the Forge premium DLC in Autumn; and the Mysteria Ecclesiae premium DLC in Winter.</p>
<p>For our detailed review of the game, featuring a perfect score from Chris Wray, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to this article</a>.</p>
