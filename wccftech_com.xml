			<p>NIS America has announced that Ys X: Proud Nordics will launch outside of Japan on Nintendo Switch 2 and PC sometime in early 2026. It first launched exclusively in Japan for Nintendo Switch 2 this past July 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics is the "<em>definitive edition</em>" of Ys X: Nordics, according to NIS America, which launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/ys-x-nordics-is-out-october-25-in-western-countries/">last October outside Japan</a>. The most recent Ys release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-review-a-classic-reborn/">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana,</a> which arrived earlier this year. </p>



<p>Ys X: Proud Nordics follows Adol, accompanied by Norman Karja, standing against an undying force called the Griegr. It's then up to Adol and Karja to bring a group of adventurers together to defeat the Griegr, and save the Obelia Gulf.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Proud Nordics will also launch with "<em>improved graphical performance and quality of life updates</em>," and include "<em>new mechanics and content"</em> not previously available in the original version of the game from last October.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Ys X: Nordics</a> last October, he called it "<em>one more memorable adventure</em>" in the long-running series. </p>



<p>"<em>While some of the changes made to the formula the series employed for 15 years may not sound too exciting on paper, they come together really well in Ys X Nordics, making it the first proper step forward for the franchise in quite a while. The increased focus on the narrative may put some long-time fans of the series off, as may the slight increase in complexity of its system, but if they manage to look past these non-issues, they will find an extremely solid ARPG and a worthy continuation of the long-running series by Falcom."</em> </p>

			<p>James Gunn, who has been leading the comeback for DC alongside Peter Safran, spends most of his time focused on upcoming DC films, like the recent Superman movie he directed. His role does also involve him overlooking upcoming DC games, and on that subject he's admitted that there is "<em>one thing in particular</em>" that he's excited about, but the biggest projects all remain in "<em>early stages</em>."</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/dc-tv-shows/after-years-of-silence-dc-boss-james-gunn-teases-dcus-gaming-plans-theres-one-thing-in-particular-im-excited-about-but-it-does-take-time/">GamesRadar</a>, Gunn vaguely spoke about what's to come for DC games, which is one of the four pillars along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, and Game of Thrones that WB Games</a> is focusing its efforts on.</p>



<p>"<em>There's been some slight movement on different things,</em>" Gunn began. "<em>We have a couple of little DC games coming out. But we also have talked about – and in early stages of planning – some bigger things. One thing in particular I'm excited about, but it does take time. There's been some changes in Warner Bros Games, and so we're dealing with new people.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, some of the changes Gunn is referring to include the restructuring of WB Games to focus on just four major franchises, along with the closing of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and the cancellation of the Wonder Woman</a> game that was previously in the works.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the next major game featuring a DC character is <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, which was announced earlier this week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>, and will arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.  </p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss has announced Edania, a new region for Black Desert Online that's available across all servers right now, at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>Edania's launch adds a new main story questline titled The Society of the Equilibrium, which will be available only to players at level 60 or higher. It'll also introduce seven branching questlines with the Edania Adventure Log, for players to further map their journey into the demon realm.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are also new PvE weekly challenges and a new PvP challenge that players can earn after they've defeated a regional boss. The update also adds new gear, enhancements, artifacts, consumables, and new enemies to fight across new lands to explore. The Azure Battlefield, Nymphamaré Castle, and Orbita Castle are the three new lands, each with unique enemies to fight and a regional boss to defeat.</p>

<p>"<em>Edania is a high-risk, high-reward destination for the boldest of Adventurers," </em>Pearl Abyss writes in a press release. "<em>Whether you're a master of combat, a skilled craftsman, or a sovereign in the making—your legacy in the Demon Realm awaits.</em>"</p>



<p>Pearl Abyss added <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-reveals-black-desert-march-content-roadmap-including-games-first-hardcore-server/">Black Desert Online's first hardcore servers</a> earlier this year. Beyond Black Desert Online, Pearl Abyss is also working on Crimson Desert, which it recently delayed into <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">Q1 2026</a> ahead of the studio making an appearance at Gamescom 2025 with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">Crimson Desert demo</a> for attendees at the convention to try for themselves, just like they did last year.</p>



<p>The next major update for Edania will arrive on September 11, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team-cherry-is-already-working-on-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-new-report-details-why-silksong-took-six-years-to-make.1277433/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry, developer of Hollow Knight and Hollow Knight Silksong, the latter of which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">finally have a release date for</a>, is already working on DLC for Silksong, the team confirmed in an interview that went live alongside Silksong's launch date news. The report also delved into why Team Cherry took as long as they did to make Silksong, with the answer more or less being that they were having too much fun working on the game.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, the studio's co-founders, Ari Gibson and William Pellen admitted that "<em>We’ve been having fun</em>. <em>This whole thing is just a vehicle for our creativity anyway. It’s nice to make fun things</em>," said Pellen.</p>



<p>Gibson added that the team never hit a wall with development. Silksong's long journey to release wasn't a result of a complicated development process that involved them overhauling the game and having to re-do major parts of it, like what <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/">BioShock 4</a> is currently going through. Instead, it came down to the fact that they just kept adding more to the game, and the more they added, the more work was involved in ensuring it was at a level of polish on par with their standards and everything else in the game. </p>



<p>Also, Team Cherry never expanded to a massive team, and keeping things small also played a key part in how long everything took.</p>



<p>"<em>Even at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of </em><em>Hollow Knight</em> or probably exceed it,<em>" </em>said Gibson. "<em>And then because of how we work, obviously the world ended up being just as big or bigger. And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.</em>"</p>



<p>Another key part of why Silksong took as long as it did is that Team Cherry had all the runway it needed for six, seven, or even 15 years, with Hollow Knight confirmed to have sold <strong>over 15 million copies</strong> since its launch in 2017. That kind of indie success can keep a small team working and fed for a long time, with Gibson and Pellen even admitting that they're only finally launching the game "<em>for the sake of just completing the game."</em></p>



<p>"<em>I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," </em>Gibson continued. "<em>Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’</em>"</p>



<p>And if you're remembering the times where we were sure that Silksong was ready, only for it to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/">delayed</a>, Gibson and Pellen say that at the time, they truly believed it would have been out, if not for the fact that, as previously mentioned, their small team and amount of content required they take their time to ensure everything was at their standards. In fact, the last two years of the game's development have been spent just on polishing and bug squashing, pun intended.</p>



<p>All together, Bloomberg's report is the exact kind of story you'd want to hear about an indie studio like Team Cherry. Instead of being burnt out, they're just as excited as they were six years ago to keep working on the game. That's why they already have DLC in development. They've only been so quiet about the game because they didn't want to "<em>sour"</em> any excitement around it, since any update we could've gotten was that they were still working on it.</p>



<p>Also, if after all this time and all this excitement, you still feel cautious about Silksong and wanted to wait for reviews on it, know that you'll be waiting well after release, since Team Cherry thought it would be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">"<em>unfair</em>"</a> to those who backed the game on Kickstarter years ago if critics got the chance to play it ahead of everyone else, and won't be sending out pre-release codes for reviews.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong will be out on PC, current and last-gen consoles in just two weeks, on September 4, 2025.</p>
