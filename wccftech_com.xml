			<p>One of the biggest technical surprises when it comes to the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console was that it would support features like HDR (High Dynamic Range displays) and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate). However, as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by a ResetEra user</a>, any mention of VRR being available when setting the console in docked (or TV) mode has been removed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canadian</a> websites.</p>
<p>The description used to say:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR, VRR, and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>Now, though, it has been modified to:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-More-details-about-features-2790188.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British website</a> still features the original description, hence the confusion. Needless to say, we'll reach out to Nintendo to try and get clarification on the subject. It would be very underwhelming if docked mode truly lacked variable refresh rate, which would be critical for a smooth gameplay experience when playing at 4K on the console.</p>
<p>This does not affect handheld mode, which has built-in NVIDIA G-SYNC through a native DisplayPort 1.4 connection. The speculation is that variable refresh rate might be lost in the conversion from DisplayPort to the HDMI output needed for docked mode.</p>
<p>In other slightly weird Nintendo Switch 2 news, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild nor The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will support the cloud save backup feature</a> that is included with the Nintendo Switch Online premium membership. To clarify, it will still be possible to transfer saves from the original Nintendo Switch, but users won't be able to create new cloud saves in these versions.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World fans will want to tune in to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated Direct stream later today</a>.</p>
