			<p>A new Dark Souls 3 mod now in development promises to rejuvenate the game's multiplayer mechanics in the same way a similar mod does in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/">Elden Ring.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukeyui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LukeYui</a>, the developer behind the Elden Ring Seamless Co-op mod released a while back, is currently working on a similar mod for the third entry in the now classic FromSoftware series, which will allow players to enjoy the entirety of the game together with friends from beginning to end with synchronized progress, no resummoning and optional invasions, essentially removing every vanilla multiplayer restriction. You can check out the seamless multiplayer experience coming in the future to Dark Souls 3 in the video below.</p>

<p>Despite the game having been released a while back, the Dark Souls 3 modding community continues to be extremely active and is continuing to introduce all sorts of improvements to the game. Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the excellent Bloodborne Remastered Project, recently released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-visual-overhaul/">visual overhaul mod</a> that carries over much of the work made on the emulated PlayStation 4 game to offer improvements that are worthy of an official remaster.</p>
<p>Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game by checking out our review.</p>

			<p>During the latest Letter from the Producer LIVE broadcast, the next patch for Final Fantasy XIV was revealed, with the <a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full patch</a> being named Patch 7.2: Seekers of Eternity. In the broadcast, Producer and Director <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-producer-naoki-yoshida-reiterates-the-studios-committment-to-xbox/">Naoki Yoshida</a> walked the audience through the additions that will be released with this patch, including a continuation of the Main Scenario Quests, a new Unreal Trial, and more. Below is an archive of the stream, but it is in Japanese only.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Letter from the Producer LIVE Part LXXXV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVQWDewBrfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Letter from the Producer, Yoshida also mentioned upcoming content named Cosmic Exploration, which is a new activity coming to Final Fantasy XIV, which is designed for crafters and gatherers. You can team up with other players and explore uncharted stars together while gathering supplies that you may need. There are also new field operations named the Occult Crescent.</p>
<p>The Occult Crescent is a large-scale battle-oriented duty, where you have to explore unmapped terrain and explore a mysterious isle while having to battle against the inhabitants that live there as you try to uncover the isle's secrets.</p>
<p>This new patch for Final Fantasy XIV is set to bring something for everyone. Whether you're a player who solely does the MSQ or you also like to do some of the more challenging group content, everyone will be well-catered to. Speaking of group content, there will be a new dungeon added in this patch, named The Underkeep. The next tier of the Raid will also be released, called The Arcadion: Cruiserweight Tier. Recollection is the newest Trial to be added to the game, available on Normal and Extreme difficulty if you find yourself wanting a challenge.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new Unreal Trial has been added, where you can revisit Hells' Kier and take on Suzaku, one of the Four Lords at level 100.</p>
<p>While there is a focus on adding new group content to Final Fantasy XIV, there will also be new Allied Society quests, where you'll be able to assist the Mamool Ja. There will also be new Hildibrand quests to take on if you find that you have completed all of the pre-existing ones in the game.</p>
<p>Series 8 of PvP will be beginning in this new patch, including several new actions for large-scale PvP encounters, as well as adjustments to the pre-existing actions. Frontline (Secure) makes a return to the PvP rotation, but this time it comes with some map improvements.</p>
<p>Before this patch goes live, a final minor patch will be released prior, which will be released on February 25. While there is no set date for the Seekers of Eternity patch, it was mentioned by Yoshida that it will be released some time in March.</p>
