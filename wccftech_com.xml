			<p>More than half of the total CAPCOM software sales for the first half of the current fiscal year have been on PC, according to the publisher's latest financial report.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/explanation/2025/2nd/1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> covering the first half of FY25, the Japanese publisher confirmed that sales, operating income, and Digital Contents segment are all down 25%, 39%, and 35%, respectively, over the previous fiscal year, which is not surprising, considering the publisher launched mostly minor titles in the first six months of the current fiscal year. Still, the publisher confirmed it is still on target to achieve its annual forecast thanks to a second half of the year that will be stronger than the first, thanks to the upcoming launch of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>This fiscal year's sales also highlighted a growing trend for CAPCOM, as of the 20.025 million units of software sold, 54% were sold on PC, with console sales shrinking from 51% in FY20 to 40% in FY25. The publisher's focus on the PC market is definitely paying off, and it will be interesting to see how much Monster Hunter Wilds will sell on PC compared to consoles, which don't seem will deliver the best way to enjoy one of the most anticipated games of 2025, judging from <a href="https://wccftech.com/monstewr-hunter-wilds-display-modes-consoles-120-hz/">impressions</a> from the PS Plus exclusive beta which began today.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will feature multiple display modes on consoles, as well as a 120 Hz output option, judging from the PS Plus exclusive beta that is now live worldwide.</p>
<p>As shown in a screenshot shared on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-ot-born-to-be-wild.1020882/post-130805709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, the next entry in the series, launching in a few months, will allow players to either prioritize resolution or framerate, as well as enable 120 Hz output for VRR-compatible displays. Unfortunately, according to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-ot-born-to-be-wild.1020882/post-130807878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, both display modes have to make some heavy compromises in terms of framerate and image quality, and performance is not very stable in either mode, dropping heavily in some areas so much that VRR is disengaged, but thankfully, there's still some time before release, and things could be improved further in time for release.</p>
<p>While image quality and performance may not be amazing, it definitely feels like Monster Hunter Wilds will be a massive step forward over its predecessors thanks to some of its new features, which include the Focus Mode gameplay mechanics and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lobbies-100-players/">100 player lobbies</a> that promise improved interactivity with other hunters.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th, 2024. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">preview.</a></p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/">Horizon Forbidden West</a> patch introduces an image treatment solution that delivers better image quality from what we have seen so far of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> discussed this new image treatment solution, saying that it delivers a pristine image quality that is close to what NVIDIA DLSS can deliver on PC and considerably better than what we have seen PSSR do so far. This solution, which is reportedly in development for Guerrilla Games' next project, is likely a compute-based solution that doesn't use the machine learning hardware of the PlayStation 5 Pro, so it could potentially run on the base console, where it could deliver much more impressive results, considering the only upscaler available on the regular PS5 is AMD FSR, which delivers some middling results, as we have seen over and over in the past few months.</p>
<p>Although the great image quality delivered by this image treatment solution could be thanks to the high base resolution (1440p / 1584p to 4K), it could also be another great option for developers, as it could allow Guerrilla or any other developer using the Decima engine, like Kojima Productions with Death Stranding 2, to use the PlayStation 5 Pro machine learning hardware to do other things.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #186: Teraflop War OVER, Killzone Dead, Alan Wake 2 PS5 Pro, Silent Hill 2 Patched!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RrGDYXvKBk?start=6024&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The superior image quality delivered by Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 5 Pro, thanks to this new image treatment solution, could be matched by any other game using PSSR with a high enough base resolution, as the games using the upscaler seen so far had a much lower base resolution than 1440p. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to see for ourselves what the AI-powered upscaler will be able to do under the right conditions, as the console launches next week, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>
