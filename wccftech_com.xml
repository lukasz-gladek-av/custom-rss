			<p>Yesterday, Blizzard <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2355027128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted a developer live stream</a> to reveal many new details about Diablo IV Season of Witchcraft, scheduled to go live on public servers on January 21 at 10 AM Pacific Time. Arguably, the biggest addition is the long-awaited Armory feature, which allows players to seamlessly change from different saved builds when they are in towns. The Armory is character-bound rather than account-bound, and each character can save up to five different loadouts. On the Armory screen, players will see right away a specific build's Equipment, Skills, selected Paragon Nodes and Glyphs. Notably, switching between loadout slots with different Paragon loadouts is free. If an item saved in the player's Armory loadout is no longer available because it has been sold, traded, or salvaged, an icon will indicate the item is missing in the loadout preview.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The Armory is available in both Seasonal and Eternal Realms. Eternal Realm players can also rejoice, as Blizzard made the Welcome Back Booster (which lets players boost an Eternal Realm character to Level 50, complete with Legendary Items and pre-set class skills) a permanent fixture.</p>
<p>Diablo IV Season of Witchcraft focuses on the Coven of the Witches of Hawezar. These protectors of the Tree of Whispers have noticed that several heads have mysteriously disappeared. They recruit players to track down the missing heads as part of a new seasonal questline that also unlocks three kinds of witchy powers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eldritch - Wield magic that harnesses destructive energies.</li>
<li>Psyche - Use the defensive powers of the mind and spirit to create visions, focus your attacks, and cause madness in your enemies.</li>
<li>Growth &amp; Decay - Wield living magic that both heals and harms, increasing health and resources. These spells can create terrible diseases and disruptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players may even discover powers that have been Lost to the Coven. To unlock them, they'll have to find Forgotten Altars, which can be located in random dungeons. Additionally, Occult Gems have been added. These seasonal socketables provide additional affixes and add Witchcraft tags to the player's Skills, complementing the new Witchcraft Powers. Occult Gems are crafted from materials earned by completing Whisper Bounties and returning Fugitive Heads from Headhunts.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Diablo IV Season of Witchcraft adds three new Legendary Runes for owners of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred expansion</a>. Nagu generates 100 Offering, asking the player to maintain at least 1 active Summon for 5 seconds, gaining Offering for each up to 6 Summons. Igni generates 25 Offering and stores Offering every 0.3 seconds; players must cast a non-basic skill to gain the stored Offering (up to 500). The last one is an Invocation Rune called Chac; it costs 25 Offering to invoke Druid Lightning Bolts, striking a nearby enemy for 220% weapon damage.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 leaked clock speeds, which look rather legitimate, further suggest how the system is powered by an 8nm chip, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> leaked clock speeds</a> of the new system, highlighting how they look reasonable enough for the type of system the Nintendo Switch 2 will be, although with some caveats, such as the handheld GPU clock speed looking a little low for the type of cooling the system has, and the CPU clock speeds, which are not particularly low for an 8nm CPU sporting eight Cortex A78 cores, being higher in portable mode than docked. The latter is particularly interesting, as it suggests there is still something we do not know about how the system works in this case, as it might disable cores in portable modes to save battery, or could have different CPU frequency modes in docked mode. Still, everything considered, these clock speeds are definitely in line with what an 8nm chip can achieve, further suggesting that it is the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the system. Speaking about the specs, one point of concern could be the low memory bandwidth in portable mode, especially if the system uses a 1080p screen as rumored. The reveal trailer, unfortunately, did not specify if the screen sports a higher resolution than the one of the original system.</p>
<p>What the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer also failed to show is how the system will take advantage of the T239's Ampere architecture. The short Mario Kart footage was not at a very high resolution, and it looked aliased as the vast majority of Nintendo games, and in no part, it showed evidence of using NVIDIA DLSS or any other advanced feature that the architecture can deliver. Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS, Digital Foundry rightly highlights during the podcast how the Nintendo Switch 2 could be able to use the new Transformer Model, but its viability remains a question, considering the new model is computationally heavier than the current CNN model and wasn't developed for a mobile system that's essentially a few generations old at this point. Considering the recent patent essentially details a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">lightweight DLSS</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2, we are unlikely to see the same identical desktop Transformer model running on the system due to computational limitations.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. More information on the console will be revealed in a dedicated Direct scheduled for early April.</p>
