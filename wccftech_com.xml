			<p>Hideo Kojima was as surprised as anyone learning this week that he was offered to develop a video game project based on the Matrix franchise, as no one ever told him such a conversation took place between the Wachowskis and Konami.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the legendary game designer and creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series clarified<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-matrix-creators-wanted-kojima-make-a-game-on-the-ip-konami-refused/"> the statements made a few days ago by Christopher Bergstresser</a>, the Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and business Development at Konami between 1996 and 2002. </p>



<p>In his post on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907">X</a>, Kojima-san confirmed that, back in 1999, he and the Wachowskis exchanged emails as mutual fans, and later met when they traveled to Japan to promote the original Matrix movie for its Japanese release. Kojima-san believes he met them three times, but the offer never came up in any of the conversations he had during these meetings.</p>



<p>"<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">At that time, I was already extremely busy with MGS2 and probably couldn’t have accepted the offer right away. But if someone had told me, maybe there could’ve been a way to make it work,</em>" Hideo Kojima concluded.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had “offered me a Matrix game project!” back in 1999. In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails. The Matrix hadn’t been… <a href="https://t.co/4P10P9eEfT">pic.twitter.com/4P10P9eEfT</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It is a real shame a Matrix video game project developed by Hideo Kojima never came to be, if the offer had indeed been made, as it would have been a match made in even. Although the franchise's popularity is not what it was in the early 2000s, such a game project would have incredible potential even today, as none of the games based on the franchise have captured what makes it special.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation Portal handheld system may be about to get a highly-requested feature soon, judging from a PS App leak.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1ohdvol/streaming_owned_games_imminent/">PlayStation Portal official subreddit</a>, user GetTheWetsOn shared a screenshot captured from the PS App of the Deliver at All Costs store page, which seemingly confirms that cloud streaming of purchased digital games could be coming to the PlayStation Portal for PS Plus Premium subscribers. The user also stated that the same confirmation, which has since been removed, could be found on the Dead Space remake store page.</p>



<p>While there's no indication this new PlayStation Portal streaming option is indeed coming, its confirmation on the store pages of two different games is unlikely to be a mistake, so there's a high chance it will eventually arrive on the system. </p>



<p>Ever since the system's release and its surprising popularity, Sony has repeatedly iterated that the company is looking into <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming/">expanding the system's functionality</a>. Allowing streaming of owned digital PlayStation games without having to download them first on their home system would be the perfect way to do so.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal is a Remote Play focused handheld device which launched back in 2023 worldwide. While not the successor of the PlayStation Vita many have been expecting for a long time, the system does what it does exceptionally well. You can learn more about it by checking out Kai's<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/"> review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It was practically a given following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the mass layoffs at Amazon Game Studios</a>, but we now have confirmation that New World, the MMORPG developed by the team based in Irvine, California, is effectively on life support.</p>



<p>Amazon has clarified that Season 10: Nighthaven, which launched earlier this month, will be the last content update because further development 'is not sustainable'. The servers are, however, guaranteed to remain up throughout December 31, 2026 at the least. Complete closure of the servers will likely follow shortly after that date, although Amazon said it will notify players at least six months before that happens.</p>



<p>For now, the game and its in-game currency remain purchasable on all platforms, and New World also remains playable on PlayStation 5 for PlayStation Plus subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers. Again, when that changes, Amazon will send a notice.</p>



<p>The MMORPG was the first big project financed by Amazon as part of its gaming initiative. <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-reveals-breakaway-new-world-crucible-at-twitchcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was originally revealed at TwitchCon 2016</a> alongside the MOBA Breakway and the third-person shooter game Crucible, which however were canceled before or shortly after their launch.</p>



<p>New World, on the other hand, kept going, albeit with a few delays. The original vision was for a sandbox-style PvP focused MMORPG, but the team pivoted to a more traditional PvE game with dungeons and story missions while still retained some PvP elements from the previous design.</p>



<p>As someone who followed the game throughout its entire development and then spent a couple of hundred hours playing it, I can say that this confusing design was among the game's biggest failures. While a lot of people were hyped for its release in September 2021 as the first Western-made AAA MMORPG to launch since 2014's The Elder Scrolls Online, leading to a strong debut that <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even Jeff Bezos praising the team</a>, it became immediately clear that there wasn't nearly enough PvE content to keep PvE players interested. On the other hand, the PvP limitations (optional flagging, no looting, etc.) that were introduced to cater to those PvE players ensured that even the PvP niche was not satisfied.</p>



<p>The game could only keep me and my guild interested for two months before boredom inevitably set in. Overall, players left in droves. To their credit, the developers started working on more PvE content, as evidenced by the following updates, the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year's Aeternum rebrand and console launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, it was simply not enough to turn the tide. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final attempt with Season 10: Nighthaven</a> actually caught the interest of MMO fans, allowing the game to rebound and bringing back long server queues, but it was probably too little, too late at that point, as Amazon had already decided to close down the project.</p>



<p>So far, Amazon has not clarified what will happen to The Lord of the Rings MMO project, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revived two years ago</a>. It is most likely dead, too, but we have asked for an official statement on the matter.</p>
