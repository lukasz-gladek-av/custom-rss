			<p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/">announced</a> that it will officially end its PlayStation Stars loyalty program. As of today, the program will not be accepting new members, and those already part of the program will see no new campaigns or rewards added and will no longer be able to earn points after July 23, 2025. Players who choose to leave at any point after today will not be able to rejoin the program and will lose all their points.</p>
<p>"<em>At Sony Interactive, we’re always experimenting with new and exciting ways to bring our community of players together to share the joys of gaming and create lasting memories,</em>" Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty, and licensed merchandise at Sony, began on a PlayStation Blog post.</p>
<p>"<em>That’s why three years ago, we created PlayStation Stars, a loyalty program to celebrate our players. The unique program includes playing games to earn rewards – including our unique Digital Collectibles that pay homage to incredible games and our PlayStation legacy. The program has helped foster a deeper connection with fans around the world.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this program, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings.</em>"</p>
<p>The loyalty program was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-introduces-playstation-stars-loyalty-program-brings-digital-collectible-rewards-and-loyalty-points/">announced and launched in 2022</a>, and the first reaction from players was that PlayStation Stars potentially began its life as an NFT program, but was pivoted into what we ended up with when PlayStation caught wind of how incredibly unpopular NFTs had become.</p>
<p>What ended up being the best part of the program was the fact that, for a while, it was possible to earn enough points to collect $25 and $5 worth of credit on the PlayStation Store. Players did everything they could to 'game' the system, and Sony took steps to rebalance how points were dolled out to curb those efforts.</p>
<p>Players who still have points they'd like to redeem will be able to do so until November 2, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-show-off-its-mid-to-endgame-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom confirmed that there will be an official Dune: Awakening live stream on Wednesday, May 28, at 6 PM CEST via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Funcom/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> to discuss the game's mid-to-endgame. The Norwegian developer has promised that there will be plenty to do for PvE and PvP players alike, but the specifics will be unveiled next week.</p>
<p>For now, we know that players will form clans and then affiliate themselves with either the Atreides or the Harkonnen Great Houses. They will compete against one another mainly in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Desert PvP map</a>, which is said to be absolutely gigantic in size (around 500 square kilometers, according to Funcom Game Director Joel Bylos) and capable of hosting hundreds of players simultaneously. The map will be refreshed each week (the lore explanation for it being the Coriolis sandstorms) to provide continuously interesting points of interest to explore. The ultimate goal is, of course, to harvest Spice, but there's also the mostly hazy Landsraad politics system where players will be able to vote on things that could impact the whole world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Thank You for Playing the Beta Weekend" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m_TgFDrLM7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many thousands of players recently tried the early game during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Closed Beta Test weekend</a>. This part of Dune: Awakening consisted of 20-25 hours, or 25% of the Hagga Basin map, so it only scratched the surface of what players will find in the massive survival multiplayer game. Even in this brief time and limited content, players amassed some impressive numbers in the beta. There were 107K deaths by Shai-Hulud (the sandworm), while 214K vehicles were crafted to aid players in moving throughout the desert. Nearly 10 million scavenger enemies were killed; 151K liters of water were consumed; 8.7 million liters of blood were extracted from defeated foes; 10K vehicles were lost in sandstorms, and more than 65K players withered away in the sun, dying from exposure to the deadly elements of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening launches on June 10 for PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-other-rtx-updates-shown-off-for-upcoming-and-existing-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support</a>. Pre-order customers who purchase the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition can start playing on June 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty.1195347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>April 2025 was another Xbox-focused month on the sales charts and the active player numbers charts, with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered ranking as the best-selling game on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and Call of Duty leading monthly active users on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>The latest monthly data comes from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo3w2xuc2e">Circana</a> executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who posts some of the charting information Circana collects each month.</p>
<p>Five of the top 10 best-selling games for April 2025 were Xbox games, and three of those five were all in the top-five best-selling games for the month, with Oblivion Remastered at the top, followed by Forza Horizon 5 in the number two spot, and Minecraft at the number four spot. The other Xbox games in the top-10 were Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered has also already become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-dominate-ps5s-download-charts-for-april-2025-oblivion-remastered-already-the-uss-third-best-selling-game-of-2025/">third-best-selling game of 2025</a>, trailing only Monster Hunter Wilds and Assassin's Creed Shadows. On PlayStation specifically, four of the top five best-selling games for April 2025 in the US were all Xbox games.</p>
<p>In terms of monthly active users, Microsoft-owned Call of Duty led both Xbox and PlayStation platforms. Oblivion Remastered was the fifth most-played game on Steam, with the number one spot held by Schedule I.</p>
<p>So Xbox and Microsoft are very clearly dominating software sales, though on the hardware side, PlayStation has stayed in the lead, even with hardware spending falling overall compared to the sales in the US for April 2024.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Handheld Will Be Powered by Custom Low-Power APU from AMD – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-will-be-powered-by-custom-low-power-apu-from-amd-%E2%80%93-rumor.1195278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Contrary to what recent findings seemed to suggest, the yet-to-be-officially revealed Xbox handheld will not switch to the ARM architecture, but will be powered by an AMD APU.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/qualcomm-job-posting-suggest-the-next-xbox-will-be-based-on-arm.1684130/post-270428048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoGAF forums</a>, known AMD leaker KeplerL2 commented on the handheld, saying that it will be powered by a custom low-power APU from AMD. The Xbox-branded handhelds, on the other hand, will use whatever APUs are available to OEMs, including Z2E from AMD, Lunar/Panther Lake from Intel, X Elite 2 from Qualcomm, and N1 from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Though it was expected for Microsoft to go with AMD again for its next-generation systems, including the dedicated handheld, which has been teased multiple times in the past, a job ad that surfaced online last week<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-xbox-arm/"> suggested</a> that some of the next-gen Xbox products could make the switch to the ARM architecture. This choice could have made sense somewhat for a handheld system, as the ARM architecture provides better power efficiency, but it would have led to issues in terms of compatibility with current software, and not having access to a large part of the Xbox library wouldn't really fit with the current strategy of making Xbox games available on as many devices as possible.</p>
<p>With the Xbox handheld likely far from release, we will get to see the first glimpses of the company's handheld strategy with the aforementioned branded handhelds. The first one, known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">Project Kennan</a>, is being developed in collaboration with ASUS, will run Windows, unsurprisingly, and feature an interface reminiscent of the Xbox consoles. This handheld should be released before the end of the year.</p>

			<p>A new Red Dead Redemption 2 mod is now available for download, introducing enhanced ambient occlusion and other visual improvements that bring the game's visuals closer to the quality seen in pre-release trailers.</p>
<p>The WOW... That's Beautiful mod, which is now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/6335?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces enhanced ambient occlusion, more vibrant colors, finer texture details, better environment shading, and disables pedestrian light to enhance the game's visuals and bring them more in line with those seen in pre-release trailers. The end results are incredible, making it a great download for those who want to experience Arthur Morgan's story like never before.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 launched on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One back in 2018 and was later ported to PC in 2019. While the game was never properly updated for current generation consoles, a new PS5 and Xbox Series X|S patch is <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-upgrade/">reportedly</a> in the works, together with a Nintendo Switch 2 port that could be released before the end of the year. Though unconfirmed, these new releases would definitely help Rockstar Games and Take-Two's release schedule for the second half of the year, especially after Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed to May 2026.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about one of the best open-world games ever released by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review.</a></p>
