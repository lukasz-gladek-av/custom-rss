			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-would-like-to-add-a-map-editor-a-single-player-experience-and-more/">1047 Games</a>, the studio behind Splitgate and Splitgate 2, whose co-founder boldly proclaimed from the Summer Game Fest 2025 stage that Splitgate 2 will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">"<em>make FPS great again</em>,"</a> admitted that they have <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/building-the-splitgate-you-deserve">launched Splitgate 2 "<em>too early</em>,"</a> and have announced that the studio will undergo a massive overhaul of the game before re-launching sometime in early 2026. Alongside this announcement was the reveal that the studio is laying off more members of the development team, and the servers for the original Splitgate are getting shutdown next month.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 officially launched on June 6, 2025, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and though it'll still be playable for the foreseeable future and will still get the upcoming Chapter 3 update, 1047 Games has effectively announced that it has 'unlaunched' the game, and is bringing it back to a beta state. </p>



<p>"<em>We've heard your feedback, and we agree with you,</em>" the studio writes in its statement, which was published on its website and to the game's official account on X and attributed to co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian. "<em>We launched too early. We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly, we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with. So we're going back to beta. We'll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>That means reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more, which we'll share soon</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To the Splitgate community,</p><p>We believe in Splitgate 2. This game means everything to us – it's been our life for almost 10 years, starting in our dorm room, and we're more committed than ever to delivering the incredible experience you deserve.</p><p>We’ve heard your feedback, and we…</p></div>— Splitgate 2 (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The statement goes on to confirm that the studio is laying off more staff, with 45 people <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown?utm_source=threads,twitter">reportedly</a> losing their jobs at 1047 Games, and so that the cuts don't impact the team too heavily, OG-Splitgate is getting its servers shut down "<em>in a month.</em>" </p>



<p>1047 Games says that though it would love to keep those servers online, "<em>it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team.</em>" It is however "<em>exploring the possibility</em>" of creating an offline mode and/or peer-to-peer matches, so that dedicated fans of the first Splitgate game can still play it beyond the shutdown.</p>



<p>The studio also promises to have "<em>a dedicated experience in Splitgate 2 that delivers on the promise of the original,</em>" when Splitgate 2 re-launches in 2026. </p>



<p>"<em>We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes,</em>" the statement reads as it begins to conclude. "<em>But we've learned a lot and</em> <em>are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up. We love this game and we love this community too much to ever quit. So we won't</em>."</p>



<p>After 1047 Games launched with all the confidence in the world, it's clear that it was sorely misguided when Splitgate 2 officially launched last month, which players knew without the studios' co-founders having to admit it. There are still plenty of questions regarding what the changes will be exactly, how the game will still be playable, whether it will now appear as 'Splitgate 2 - Open Beta' on consoles and PC, and when exactly the OG-Splitgate servers will be taken offline.</p>



<p>It's all together not at all what 1047 Games envisioned when they were looking ahead at Splitgate 2's launch earlier this year. By the time the studio is ready to re-launch the game next year, it'll be interesting to see if anyone is still waiting around for 1047 to "<em>make FPS great again</em>," and if anyone will even care that it's back after what's been a mixed bag of a first launch, to say the least.</p>
