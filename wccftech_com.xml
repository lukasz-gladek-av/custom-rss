			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler has made some nice progress lately, so much so that it now reportedly always delivers better image quality than TAA, temporal anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa-rtgi-shader-compilation-taa-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> regarding the revamped version of the Anvil Engine that powers Assassin's Creed Shadows, Engine Technical architects Nicolas Lopez and Pierre Fortin and Project Lead Programmer Rendering Sébastien Daigneault commented on why the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game currently doesn't support the PSSR upscaler, saying that, at the time of shipping the game, they found better results with TAA.</p>
<p>However, after an in-depth collaboration with Sony over the past few months, many issues have been addressed, especially regarding moving vegetation and water, issues that have been found in other games as well. As such, PSSR now always delivers better image quality than TAA, and support will be added in the future. Alongside PSSR support, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will also get ray-traced reflections in Balanced Mode, providing better visuals at a higher framerate than Quality Mode.</p>
<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly looks great on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game's visuals truly shine on PC, especially on system configurations that can handle all the ray tracing features the game has to offer. Even without all the bells and whistles, the latest entry in the series is definitely worth playing for fans of the franchise's open-world RPG approach, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>The development of Half-Life 3 may be close to completion, as the unannounced game suspected to be the third main entry in the series has entered the optimization phase.</p>
<p>The latest news of the game known by its HLX codename, which was discovered in recent updates for other Valve games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, have been shared in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gabe.follower">Gabe Follower</a>, who detailed plenty of other recent discoveries, such as groups named hlx, hlxaudio and hlxartists having been found in Valve's internal systems, the introduction to the code of console commands related to optimization and NPC behavior adjustments, dynamic navigation mesh, deformable props, improved dynamic hair systems and more. All of this suggests not only how this HLX game is nearing completion but also how it is going to be a complex game, which is making people believe it could indeed be the long-anticipated conclusion to Gordon Freeman's story.</p>

<p>As Valve stated multiple times in the past it is not working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-steam-deck-software/">Half-Life 3</a>, this HLX game may not be Half-Life 3, so we shouldn't get our hopes up too much. For all we know, it could be another spin-off in the vein of Half-Life Alyx, which was released back in 2020 and took some time to become playable even without a VR headset with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-8k-ultra-settings-rtx-4080/">mods</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the silence from Valve regarding Half-Life 3, fans of the series still got something new to try out this week with the release of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a>.
