			<p>This morning, Korean publisher <strong>Kakao Games</strong> shared its updated release schedule during the Q4 2025 earnings report, including two highly anticipated MMORPGs: <strong>ArcheAge Chronicles</strong> and <strong>Chrono Odyssey</strong>. </p>



<p>Both games have already been delayed; they were originally slated for 2025, but got pushed to 2026. Now, Chrono Odyssey has been moved even further away, to <strong>Q1 2027</strong>, whereas Archeage Chronicles is still holding fast to its <strong>Q4 2026</strong> window. This is slightly surprising, because ArcheAge Chronicles <strong>still hasn't hosted any Closed Beta Tests in Western countries</strong>, yet Kakao Games is confident it will debut globally before the end of this year. </p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-ii-gets-stunning-debut-trailer-and-first-info-confirmed-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> as <strong>ArcheAge 2</strong> in November 2022. However, developer <strong>XL Games</strong> (a subsidiary of Kakao following the <strong>$100 million acquisition made in February 2020</strong>) <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> nearly two years later that they had decided to <strong>rework the project from a straight MMORPG sequel of the "sandpark" ArcheAge to a more intimate online action RPG experience</strong>. Hence, the title change. XL Games is also attempting to reach a wider global audience by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-trying-to-reach-a-wider-audience-by-focusing-on-pve-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focusing more on PvE</a></strong> (Player-versus-Environment) content, whereas the previous installment featured prominent large scale PvP features.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-qa-one-of-our-key-goals-for-the-game-is-that-it-feels-as-good-playing-solo-as-it-does-in-a-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>exclusive Wccftech interview</strong></a> we published last August, XL Games revealed that those territorial conquest features were completely removed from ArcheAge Chronicles because <strong>they didn't translate well to the action combat system and new direction</strong>. PvP is now structured, opt-in, and controlled through formats such as arenas, battlegrounds, and zone-based competitive events. <strong>Trade runs remain, but the scale and mechanics have changed</strong>, although they can still be done solo or with others.</p>



<p><strong>Housing</strong> supports shared spaces and neighborhoods where players can live alongside each other, but the focus shifted from territorial ownership toward personal expression and meaningful community-building, partly to avoid the land rush issues that were common in the first ArcheAge.</p>



<p>Endgame is now <strong>PvE-driven</strong>, focused on exploration, challenge, and meaningful progression. <strong>Instanced PvE experiences are built around teams of two to five players instead of large raid groups</strong>. Endgame includes dungeons with narrative-driven experiences, as well as crafting, trading, life skills, housing, and exploration. Overall, ArcheAge Chronicles aims to respect player time with flexible playstyles that don't feel like a second job, which was admittedly an issue in the previous title.</p>



<p>As for the other MMORPG in Kakao's schedule, Chrono Odyssey, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already hosted a limited-time Steam Closed Beta Test in June</a>. However, its reception was mixed, leading the developer, Chrono Studio, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-revamp-pretty-much-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to revamp nearly every aspect of the MMORPG</a></strong>. That's the main reason behind the new delay. <strong>Both games will be released on PC and consoles</strong>, by the way, presumably with cross-play functionality.</p>



<p>In the Kakao Games earnings call, an executive explained the reasons behind the games' long development timelines:</p>



<p><em>Regarding ArcheAge Chronicles and Chrono Odyssey, our overarching approach is to further enhance the completeness of the game build. In the process of conducting the test and going through the optimization process, we wanted to make sure that we fully reflect all the enhancements that is required. So once again, we made certain adjustments because we wanted to further expand on the validating of the development. So through these efforts, basically the timeline has been adjusted so that we could minimize the operational risk as much as possible.</em></p>

			<p>The <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">God of War</em> series is one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tentpole PlayStation franchises,</strong> and one that represents the <strong>brand's identity best</strong>. Moving from the <strong>character-action experiences</strong> of the first three entries in the series, the franchise starring Kratos has evolved into a compelling <strong>action-adventure series</strong> with the latest two games. Such a drastic departure in gameplay and tone is obviously making fans of the series curious about the <strong>franchise's future</strong>, but as of now, not much is known about how<em> God of War</em> will evolve in future games.</p>



<p>Before a new main entry in the series, however, it is rumored a smaller <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2.5D Metroidvania-style God of War </strong></a>will be released, possibly to bridge the gap between<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War Ragnarok</strong></a></em> and its sequel. Although there's the chance this game will be revealed during tomorrow's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">State of Play</strong></a>, the game's official announcement may be accompanied by another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">surprising revelation</strong>, judging from what a known insider recently said.</p>



<p>Replying to a user's question on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2021355822207598991#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a></strong>, insider Nate the Hate, who has an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">excellent track record</strong>, revealing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 announcement date</strong></a> ahead of an official confirmation, among other things, said something interesting about this <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War</em> spin-off.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"All I can say is this: When talk of the 2D God of War first started last year, I heard whispers that it was being considered for a multiplatform release,"</em> the insider said. Unfortunately, it is not yet known if this consideration "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">evolved into an active plan,"</em> so it remains to be seen if this project will become the first entry in the series to enjoy <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a multiplatform release</strong>.</p>



<p>As the insider did not specify what kinds of&nbsp;multiplatform whispers&nbsp;were circulating last year, the safest bet would be on&nbsp;a <strong>simultaneous PlayStation 5 and PC release</strong>, if such plans are still in the works, a strategy that was previously reserved for certain titles, such as the live service game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></strong>. At the same time, considering some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">smaller PlayStation games</strong> did release on other consoles and PC in the past, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-horizon-adventures/">LEGO: Horizon Adventures</a></strong>, it wouldn't really be surprising to see the game launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> as well, whose hybrid nature would be well-suited for a Metroidvania game.</p>



<p>Without any official information on this <em>God of War</em> project, however, <strong>a multiplatform release remains pure speculation</strong>. However, if the game is finally shown this week, we won't have to <strong>wait</strong> <strong>much longer</strong> to learn what it's about and whether non-PlayStation players will be able to experience it as well.</p>

			<p>Speculation <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already running rampant</a> on which games will be featured in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomorrow's <strong>State of Play</strong></a>, and one of the most anticipated PlayStation games of the year is certainly <strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong> from <strong>Insomniac Games</strong>. However, the studio has just dropped a tidbit hinting that <strong>it might not be featured at the event</strong>. <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2021332733998612529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Replying on X</a> to a user who asked when they'd release more information, <strong>the developers said it's happening at some point this Spring</strong>. Obviously, we are not in Spring yet.</p>



<p>It's possible they might still show off a brief new trailer without any further details about the game, but <strong>the more likely outcome is that they'll just save everything for a later showing</strong>. Perhaps they could even get their dedicated broadcast in April or May; after all, the <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> franchise has done wonders for Sony, so Marvel's Wolverine could get a special spotlight.</p>



<p>It also makes sense from a schedule perspective. Marvel's Wolverine <strong>isn't due until sometime in the Fall</strong> season, whereas another game from a Sony-owned studio is coming out much sooner. I'm referring to <strong>Housemarque's Saros</strong>, which will launch on PlayStation 5 <strong>on April 30</strong>; it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally planned for March 20</a>, but the Finnish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a <strong>slight delay</strong></a> a while ago.</p>



<p>Saros could get a deep dive at the State of Play, but it might not be the only PlayStation Studios update featured there. Insider Shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot48-has-ot48-been-hijacked-by-ot47-ot46-and-ot45-to-the-detriment-of-48-ots-of-history.1329010/post-151107211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he wouldn't be surprised if Sony Santa Monica was ready to reveal the long-awaited game led by <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>. As a reminder, following the massively successful 2018 <strong>God of War reboot</strong>, Barlog transitioned into the role of Creative Director and Producer for <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was directed by <strong>Eric Williams</strong></a>. We don't know a lot about this new project, except that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, <strong>it was going well as of July 2025</strong>, and it's not technically a new IP but might feel like one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon Gets New Gameplay Footage & Impressions from Chinese Event; Bungie: “Each Season Is Like a Roguelike Adventure”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-new-footage-impressions-chinese-event-seasons-roguelike/</link>
            <guid>1431997</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following a recent <strong>Marathon</strong> hands-on event organized by <strong>Bungie</strong> for Chinese media, new gameplay footage and impressions are now available online. The event reportedly <strong>took place in Shanghai earlier this month</strong> and was the first held outside North America.</p>



<p>The most impressive aspect reported by attendees was the <strong>significant expansion of worldbuilding and narrative depth</strong>. The tutorial and faction introductions now provide clear origins and motivations for the playable characters, creating a more coherent story framework for the extraction shooter game. Players can discover Dr. Strauss's will; he's a pivotal figure who connects multiple narrative threads from the original Marathon trilogy.</p>



<p>The PvE experience of this Marathon build <strong>proved quite challenging</strong>, according to multiple impressions. AI enemies continuously call in reinforcements over time, and environmental hazards are aplenty, including poison gas vents, perimeter turrets, and landmines scattered throughout the maps.</p>



<p>Resource management adds an extra layer of difficulty, as <strong>medical supplies and shields are fairly expensive at vendors</strong>. By the end of the play sessions, some testers couldn't afford these items without selling all their buffs. <strong>The high-risk environment apparently discourages early combat or PvP engagements</strong>, which typically result in net losses, pushing players to focus on missions to upgrade base stats instead. At least one map confirmed support for 18 players (6 teams of 3), though there are also smaller maps that support 12 players (4 teams of 3). </p>



<p>Since the Alpha version, <strong>Marathon has received a significant visual upgrade</strong>. Environments now convey a darker, more mysterious atmosphere reminiscent of Bungie's <strong>Pathways into Darkness</strong> (1993) and the original Marathon trilogy. <strong>The UI has also undergone a major overhaul</strong>, though some aspects still feel somewhat awkward according to the event's attendees. Perhaps that's just a matter of getting used to them. </p>



<p><strong>Skill distribution across all classes appears to be well-balanced</strong>, allowing flexible team compositions. Several Shells feature movement abilities, enhancing mobility options. Each runner has six base appearances tied to their respective faction.</p>



<p><strong>The weapon arsenal includes 28 guns, each with two or more skins</strong>. Some even change the entire weapon model. Every weapon features one charm slot and three sticker slots that unlock through challenge completion. Overall, <strong>impressions of the gunplay are very good</strong>, but then again, that's an area where Bungie always excelled. The cosmetic shop and battle pass were, unfortunately, unavailable during the event.</p>



<p>The footage is <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LrFZz6EGC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 10-minute video</a> available on the Chinese video sharing website Bilibili featuring <strong>Lockdown</strong>, a large scale PvE event that can trigger on the <strong>Abyssal Swamp</strong> map. Around 15 minutes later, a Point of Interest (POI) may be locked down and surrounded by red bubbles. To trigger this event, players can use the 'HEC' consumable. This allows them to enter the red bubble without taking damage for 45 seconds, during which time they can press a switch to close it. </p>



<p>After activating the switch, <strong>three waves of enemies will appear, with the final one featuring a boss</strong>. Defeating the boss provides the first wave of loot and a keycard. The locked-down area will then move to another area (it could be 'Algae Pool', 'Isolation Zone', or 'Comprehensive Facility'), and this process will repeat up to 3 times. Each time, Marathon players will need to use a keycard from the previous level to increase the difficulty level.</p>



<p>Bungie Game Director Joe Ziegler was also <a href="https://www.ali213.net/news/html/2026-2/998177_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Ali123</a>. In the conversation, <strong>he shared the studio's vision for Marathon seasons</strong>: </p>



<p><em>Each season in Marathon will be a fresh start. We envision each season as a months-long "roguelike adventure ." Each season, players will start with limited resources and must gradually grow stronger through various means, forging their own unique path to growth. To implement this concept, each season will incorporate new content and systems, substantially reshaping the seasonal gameplay. That said, some content will be retained at the player account level. For example, cosmetic items acquired through unlocking or purchasing will continue to be retained across seasons.</em></p>



<p>After several delays, Marathon <strong>will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 5</a></strong>. In less than a month, we'll know if Bungie turned around the mild reception of the previous testing phases.</p>
