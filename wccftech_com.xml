			<p>Next-generation Xbox products may be based on the ARM/Snapdragon platform, a new job listing spotted online suggests.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/job-listing-hints-at-next-generation-xbox-to-be-arm-snapdragon-based.1190199/">ResetERA forums</a>, a <a href="https://jobs.abven.com/companies/nuvia/jobs/50821791-director-sales-surface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualcomm job ad</a> for a director of sales that was posted online two days ago mentions that the position will involve supporting the <em>"sell-in activities for the next generation of Surface and Xbox products built on Snapdragon solutions,</em>" suggesting that the ARM/Snapdragon platform will power one or more offerings of the next generation of console by Microsoft. Given how the platform would provide great benefits in terms of power efficiency, it's likely that the yet-to-be-revealed Xbox handheld will be the next generation product that will be based on it, though it could create quite a few problems with compatibility with currently available games built with the x86 architecture that has powers the Xbox One and the Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Microsoft has yet to officially outline its next-generation plans, although there's no doubt that a handheld system will be part of it, as Xbox head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-once-again-teased-by-phil-spencer/">teased</a> such a system multiple times in the past. According to an earlier report, these <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation Xbox plans</a> include not only this yet-to-be-announced full-fledged handheld but also a successor to the Xbox Series X as well as another <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">handheld gaming system </a>known as Project Kennan in the vein of the Steam Deck that will run Windows and feature an interface reminiscent of Microsoft's other systems. This handheld, which should launch this year, is reportedly being worked on in collaboration with ASUS.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 poised to become another <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">massively successful console</a>, it's not surprising that both Microsoft and Sony are planning to enter, or re-enter, in Sony's case, the handheld market. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">PlayStation 6 handheld system</a> is rumored to be in the works alongside a home system that will be able to run PlayStation 5 games natively, though it won't be as powerful as the current generation console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is pushing its developers back into the office and phasing out its remote work policies, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN</a> reports.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts chief executive officer Andrew Wilson told employees in an email that hybrid work will now mean at least three days in the office, and that the company would not be hiring for any more locally remote roles.</p>
<p>In a separate email, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele clarified that these changes will not take effect immediately and that employees currently working remotely who are being asked back into the office will have a minimum of 12 weeks' notice to make the transition.</p>
<p>EA is also introducing a new 30-mile/48km radius around its offices, which will set the ground rules for what work model employees will fall under. If you live within that radius and currently work remotely, you'll transition to the newly defined hybrid model of three days a week in the office.</p>
<p>If you live outside of that radius, you'll continue to work as you are until EA designates that you have to transition either to a hybrid or an on-site model, the latter meaning you'd have to be in the office five days a week.</p>
<p>A final key change with this push back to in office work is that all future remote work hires and any exemptions to the hybrid or on-site models as they are now defined will have to go through the approval of EA's top executives, which means it'll be up to EA Entertainment president Laura Miele or Andrew Wilson to approve an employee's remote work request.</p>
<p>In Wilson's email, IGN reports he said that working in an office allows for "<em>a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players</em>."</p>
<p>That all sounds wonderful, but game studios proved, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that remote work models can be successful for teams. The pandemic proved even further that the video game industry's biggest studios could be successful with remote work models. It's not like anything Wilson describes is exclusive to working in an office.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, EA employees are not all too happy with the push, and some who anonymously spoke to IGN expressed concerns around whether they'd be able to move closer to the office in the transition period, and how needing to return to the office, even just three days a week, means a complete uprooting of their lives.</p>
<p>These new changes will undoubtedly cause talented developers who, for their own valid reasons, can't make it into an EA office three times a week to leave the company. It's a way of making cuts that doesn't have to involve EA saying they are laying people off, and without having to pay severance to those who are forced to leave due to these changes. EA's balance sheet might be better off in the eyes of Wilson and the company's bean counters, but that gain does not offset the loss of key talent.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA laid off 300-400 developers,</a> 100 of them from Respawn, and canceled another project it was incubating, which was reportedly an extraction shooter set in the world of Titanfall.</p>

			<p>We know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-skipping-pc-lose-40-sales/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> will have a massive impact on the video game industry when it launches, so it's no surprise that its delay into next year is also having a huge impact on the industry in 2025.</p>
<p>Analytics firm Ampere Analysis has lowered its revenue and sales forecast for the video game console market, specifically for PlayStation and Xbox, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/i/163618942/gta-delay-could-mean-fewer-xbox-and-playstation-console-sales-this-year-ampere-analysis">The Game Business</a> reports. Ampere's Piers Harding-Rolls expects PlayStation and Xbox to sell <strong>700,000</strong> fewer consoles than they would have if GTA VI were still being released this year.</p>
<p>Harding-Rolls and Ampere also estimate that 21 million fewer game sales will be made, and that between hardware and software revenue, the console market is missing out on approximately <strong>$2.7 billion&nbsp;</strong>in revenue.</p>
<p>Of course, the knock-on effect of all this is that expectations for 2026 are that much higher, but we're not yet halfway through 2025, and the year already looks drastically different from the one the video game industry thought it would have in January 2025.</p>
<p>Without GTA VI in the holiday lineup, the one platform that will benefit, Harding-Rolls suggests, will be Nintendo. Harding-Rolls and Ampere Analysis also aren't alone in this suggestion, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">DFC Intelligence reports</a> that in its estimates, it sees Nintendo benefiting from Grand Theft Auto VI's delay, while PlayStation and Xbox have a much more muted year.</p>
<p>Overall, Ampere now estimates that the industry will only grow by 0.9%, with a bigger 2.2% jump coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Shortly after the news of Grand Theft Auto VI being delayed was announced, it was reported that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">game had no chance of actually releasing in 2025</a>. Unfortunate as that might be for fans hoping to play it this year, the delay doesn't seem to have really <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">impacted excitement</a>, as eager fans continue to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">salivate</a> over the small bits of the game we have seen.</p>
