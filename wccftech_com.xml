			<p>After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">full gameplay reveal</a> for EA Sports FC 26 last week, EA followed it up with a gameplay deep-dive today.</p>



<p>Today's gameplay deep-dive starts out confident, as EA proclaims that its focus this year has been to respond to a request, or more accurately, a demand from players, to "<em>make gameplay better</em>." The entire gameplay experience is getting an overhaul, and EA promises that this year's gameplay is "<em>responsive, rewarding, and powered by your feedback</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>One of the biggest changes, is that there are now two gameplay presets for players to choose from, Competitive and Authentic mode. Competitive is the preset that'll be attached to the online game modes like Football Ultimate Team and Clubs, and focus more on responsive player movement and player control for a more competitive game feel.</p>



<p>Authentic mode is what you'll be preset to for offline game modes, like manager mode and player career, and lean more towards a realistic gameplay experience. Within these two new presets are also a refinement of gameplay fundamentals like tackling, pace, passing, saves, player physicality, shooting, agility - essentially, every element of gameplay has been touched up, or changed in a significant way.</p>



<p>"<em>Responsiveness, consistency, and control</em>" are the three pillars on which the Competitive gameplay preset is built, while Authentic gameplay is the simulation-style gameplay. While offline and online modes will have their presets, you'll still be able to swap between Competitive and Authentic to suit your preferred gameplay experience.</p>



<p>Regarding the gameplay fundamental changes, EA went through common complaints that players have, and went through what they changed in EA Sports FC 26 to fix the issues players are having. Some examples boiled down to gameplay producer Paul Parsons, who was narrating the video, reading off a complaint before claiming "<em>we made it better</em>" this time around, but it at least represents EA is trying to fix certain pain points with the game that players have been nudging EA to fix for years.</p>



<p>We'll see if EA is actually delivering on these big promises when EA Sports FC 26 arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC, on September 26, 2025.</p>

			<p>Wildgate, the PvP shooter that goes between ship-to-ship battle and boots-on-the-ground first-person shooting from Dreamhaven, a team made up of former Blizzard developers is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>



<p>The studio debuted a new trailer for the game alongside the launch, which shows off more gameplay and the Sea of Thieves-like gameplay with a sci-fi setting that Wildgate features.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The launch also came with a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3504780/view/530978642895831122?l=english">development blog</a> with patch notes and changes to the game based on feedback from players who had checked it out in open beta format, ahead of the full launch. </p>



<p>The patch notes include changes to player cards, and the introduction of new methods of progression, including an Infamy System, Streaks, and Milestones. It also includes the announcement of a new game mode, changes to ship balancing like updates to the health, design, and interactions between ships. There were also weapon, equipment, and loot updates, as well as balances to the combat overall, like adjusting the respawn time to 16 seconds for dying outside your ship and 12 seconds for dying on your ship.</p>



<p>Then there were also user interface changes, quality of life updates, and of course, several bug fixes to help make the launch run smoothly.</p>



<p>"<em>The response to Wildgate's open beta was incredible,</em>" said co-founder of Dreamhaven and chief executive officer Mike Morhaime, in a<a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/22/wildgate-the-crew-based-space-shooter-from-dreamhaven-and-moonshot-games-available-now/"> press release</a>. "<em>It was truly inspiring to see so many players teaming up, jumping in, and having fun. Wildgate represents what Dreamhaven believes games can be: rich, imaginative, and deeply engaging. We're just beginning to open the gate to a galaxy full of wonder, strategy, and discovery, and we hope the game resonates with players of all kinds</em>."</p>



<p>When<a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-first-look-and-hands-on-a-sci-fi-sea-of-thieves-by-former-blizzard-devs/"> Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Wildgate</a> earlier this year in March, he wrote "<em>The game definitely shows a lot of promise. I do feel there's more that could be done to improve PvE encounters, perhaps with bosses and the like. It would be especially useful if PvE-only modes were eventually to be added. Still, the game already has a solid core that could entice a lot of players to quickly jump in with their friends and have fun</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the game is out for everyone, hopefully it's able to live up to that promise.</p>
