			<p>Obsidian has <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1923067990796361892">announced</a> the 2025 roadmap for Avowed, which consists of three big updates for the rest of the year, the first of which is out now with update 1.4.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, Avowed will include a new game-plus mode, a photo mode, NPCs will have new abilities and behaviors, players will get new character presets, Godlike features, weapons, and the ability to change your appearance in the world. But that's all to come in the Summer and Fall 2025 updates.</p>
<p>As for today's Spring 2025 update with patch 1.4, Obsidian has added an arachnophobia mode, mouse and keyboard support for Xbox console players, fog of war improvements, more gold and crafting materials, and a slew of bug fixes and other tweaks that Obsidian gets into in the<a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-14-notes/"> full patch notes</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/1-4-update">blog post</a> about the roadmap and today's update on its website, Obsidian also called out that it is working to add localized language versions of Avowed for Korean, Japanese, and French-speaking players. The studio doesn't say when those versions will be available, but is "<em>committed to delivering these updates as soon as they are ready, and we deeply appreciate your patience and support as we make sure they meet the quality you deserve.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo</a> enjoyed Avowed when it arrived earlier this year, saying in his review that Avowed "<em>marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds</em>."</p>
<p>And soon we'll know just how significant it is with direct comparison to Obsidian's next game, The Outer Worlds 2, which is due to release on June 8, 2025.</p>

			<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that the first of three story expansions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is out now on all platforms, alongside the game's latest 1.3 update patch, which brings a few quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and a new horse racing feature.</p>
<p>Brushes with Death is the first of three story DLCs that players can jump into if they're looking for more Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and if you bought the Gold Edition of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, or just bought the Expansion Pass separately, then when you update Kingdom Come: Deliverance II on whatever platform you own it on, the Brushes with Death DLC will be a part of that update.</p>
<p>If you just bought the base game, then you'll be able to pick up Brushes with Death individually for $5.99 USD.</p>

<p>The Brushes with Death story sees Henry enlisted to help "<em>a mysterious artist uncover his enigmatic past.</em>" You'll travel across both maps in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's world, speaking to and occasionally fighting several new and some familiar characters throughout a number of quests to help this artist figure out his past.</p>
<p>Just last week, Warhorse Studios announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/">Kingdom Come series had surpassed 13 million copies sold</a>, with the first game breaking 10 million, and its recently released sequel surpassing 3 million copies sold.&nbsp;It's a massive milestone for Warhorse, who can easily be regarded as one of the best makers of open-world games.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,</a> our reviewer, Chris Wray, didn't have enough nice things to say about the game, saying that it is "<em>a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>
