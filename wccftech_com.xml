			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is due out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in just ten days from the time of this writing, on November 14, 2025. Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-game-ready-driver-black-ops-7-ffvii-rebirth-adds-frame-generation/">graphics card drivers are already being pushed ahead</a> of its arrival, Activision has already put out a launch trailer for the game, and more importantly, has finally put out a PC specs chart, including a small word on the specs for handheld PCs.</p>



<p>The new trailer is mostly a cinematic look at the various modes you get in Black Ops 7, with action shots of the campaign, the multiplayer, and zombies.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The PC specs are the more intriguing part of today's reveal, if only because they're not too demanding. Here's the minimum specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 1400 or Intel Core i5-6600</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 470 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 / 1060 or Intel Arc A580</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;3 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>The recommended specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 1600X or Intel Core i7-6700K</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;12 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or Intel Arc B580</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>And the specs for players that want to play at 4K:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update)</li>



<li><strong>CPU:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i7-10700K</li>



<li><strong>RAM:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Video Card:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 9070XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 / 5070</li>



<li><strong>Video Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong>&nbsp;SSD with 115 GB&nbsp;available space at launch</li>
</ul>



<p>Here's the full specs chart:</p>

<p>The most unfortunate part of this specs chart is how little is said about PC handheld optimization. On the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/ca/en/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-handheld-systems">Call of Duty blog</a>, Activision writes, "<em></em><em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;ships fully tuned for supported PC handhelds, including the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. The developers enhanced UI legibility, scaled every screen for smaller displays, and optimized the game to deliver smooth performance without sacrificing image quality. With native control support, it’s easy to drop in and start playing right away."</p>



<p>That's nice to hear but it lacks any real specifications about how the game will run on PC handhelds, like the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">which you can check out our review for here</a>). Hopefully, we'll get a better sense of how it runs ahead of launch, though, with how close we are to that, it seems PC handheld users will either get a great experience on launch, or the lack of details here is a sign of poor performance to come.</p>

			<p>While we're still waiting on a proper update in the legal battle between Nintendo and Pocketpair regarding Nintendo suing Pocketpair over Palworld and its alleged infringement on Nintendo patents, we do have an update on some of the patents in question, thanks to <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">Games Fray</a>, who has been reporting in-depth analysis on the case as it develops.</p>



<p>Spotted by Games Fray, the US Patent Office, specifically the director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), John A. Squires, has initiated a re-examination of Nintendo's patent number <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">12,403,397</a>. You might not recognize that patent by its number, so to give you a refresh, it's the one regarding summoning characters and making them battle, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-new-patent-should-not-have-happened-says-lawyer-palworld/">the one that IP and patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon said "<em>should not have happened, full stop</em>."</a></p>



<p>The patent being re-examined, especially in this case where Squires has kicked off the re-examination himself, is "<em>rare</em>," according to Games Fray, and this re-examination could result in the patent being revoked. It's possible that the patent is upheld, but with how uncommon this step is from the USPTO, that could already be a sign of trouble for Nintendo.</p>



<p>As Games Fray speculates, it could be that the public attention this case is getting has helped move it up the priority docket, with Squires examining it more closely to initiate the re-examination in the first place, but for now, we'll have to see if the re-examination bears any fruit.</p>



<p>Regardless, the fact that the USPTO is looking even more closely at Nintendo's patents likely spells more trouble for Nintendo's case against Pocketpair. It was already trying tactics that Games Fray <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">described as a "<em>hail mary</em>."</a> This case is far from over; there's still a lot that needs to play out, but more and more it is looking like Palworld maker Pocketpair will be able to come out the other side of this with a win.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima attended Lucca Comics 2025 this past weekend and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN2yGExts_c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a special panel</a> with two actors from Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Luca Marinelli (who played Neil Vana) and Alissa Jung (who played Lucy).  A lot of the panel focused on the experience of working on the game, including having to shoot remotely during the pandemic. However, Kojima also shared that he makes games partly with the hope of giving people the energy to live on and be happy.  </p>



<p><em>I grew up watching movies or reading books. When you're a child, you feel so dark about the world sometimes, but for me, there weren't really good role models around me, so what helped me was movies. The characters, or the dialogues, or the theme of the movie really cheered me up. I thought that gave me energy to live on. So I want to return that and that's one of the reasons I create games. If someone plays my game and, after a few years, feels like, I want to live on because I played this game and it cheered me up. That would be the happiest thing that I would feel because I've put that thought when creating the game. There's so many things in entertainment, but games are so immersive, and you play like hundreds of hours on games. So if I ask the person to spend hundreds of hours of their life and they are relieved of stress or whatever, that's fine too, but I also want to give them something through my game. Like, through Luca and Alyssa's relationship and the characters of the game, you feel something. You could use that in your real life and become happy. That's my goal. And of course, I haven't reached that point, but that's how I think when I create my games.</em></p>



<p>The sentiment isn't shocking for those who have come to know Kojima and his unique mentality throughout the years, and without a doubt, at least some of his games have definitely touched a few players.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launched on June 26 for PlayStation 5 to widespread critical acclaim. Given that rights of the franchise have returned to Kojima Productions, we can expect to see the game on PC and probably even on Xbox Series S and X at some point in 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just like the previous installment</a>.</p>
