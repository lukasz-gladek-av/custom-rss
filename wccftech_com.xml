			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> publisher and developer Rebellion has announced that their new post-apocalyptic adventure in the British countryside has attracted more than <strong>2 million players</strong> within the game's first month.</p>
<p>Rebellion also shared a few in-game statistics about how players have been interacting with Atomfall, like the fact that players have killed more than 5.9 million enemies with cricket bats, ordered over 250,000 pints of beer, drunk 500,000 cups of tea and died from rat swarms more than 420,000 times. Rebellion also pointed out that 'tin of meat' is players' preferred in-game food choice, with more than 14.1 million tins of meat being consumed so far.</p>
<p>In the game's opening weekend, Atomfall surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/">1.5 million players</a>, so it's not surprising that it went well past 2 million within its first month of launch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It should also be pointed out that part of Atomfall reaching the audience it has is due in part to the game being available on Xbox Game Pass from day one. Still, even considering its inclusion in Microsoft's subscription service, 2 million players in weeks for a brand-new game is still an incredible feat.</p>
<p>Just one year ago, at the time of writing, there were no Fallout-esque games that took the adventure across the pond to the United Kingdom. Now, with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a> last July and Atomfall, we have two of them. This brings up an interesting point as to whether we'll start to see the same kind of post-nuclear apocalypse setting happening outside the United States more often.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">review</a> of Atomfall, we said, "<em>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, and encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</em></p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will use the power of the PlayStation 5 Pro to offer an enhanced experience over the base hardware running at native 4K resolution.</p>
<p>In a new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, it has been confirmed that the excellent game developed by MachineGames, launching on Sony's consoles next week on April 17th, will be a PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced game. The optimized console performance on the system will offer higher and more consistent frame rates, native 4K resolution, and advanced ray tracing. Sadly, no other detail has been provided, but it's definitely impressive to learn that the power of the mid-generation refresh system allows for native 4K resolution gameplay in a demanding game such as this.</p>
<p>While Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will likely play best on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game will be perfectly enjoyable on base hardware as well. Besides featuring faster streaming and loading with frictionless loading and SSD optimization, the game will take advantage of the system CPU and GPU to achieve stable 60 FPS with high-quality resolution. Completely new to all versions of the game will be support for the DualSense controller features, such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and unique usage of the controller's lightbar, which will provide visual feedback about Indy's current status with different colors.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">Minecraft movie</a> is the latest video game adaptation to find wild financial success that goes beyond any realistic expectations viewers and industry professionals might have had for it. So it's no surprise that the film has also continued the trend of an adaptation, leading to more game sales.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/what-does-the-minecraft-movie-and">The Game Business</a>, following the launch of the Minecraft movie, daily active users in Minecraft rose 9% week-on-week, according to Ampere Analysis data. Minecraft sales, particularly on Nintendo Switch, went up 25% per Nielsen/GfK data before the movie was released and another 8% after the movie launched.</p>
<p>The Game Business then goes on to show how the Minecraft film is participating in what's now become a trend with film and TV adaptations of video games. Regardless of whether the adaptation is good, engagement and game sales get a nice spike. Some are smaller than others, but the point is that the line goes up in every case.</p>
<p>Even without financial success, like in the case of the Borderlands movie. Critics have panned the Minecraft movie, but it's a major box office success, so game sales and engagement both getting a bump makes sense. Critics also panned the Borderlands film, and it was also a box office failure. It still led to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-may-have-bombed-but-it-still-helped-sell-more-games/1100-6527626/">bump in sales</a> for the Borderlands series. However, as The Game Business does, it should be noted that a 90% discount on Borderlands 3 at the time also helped.</p>
<p>The Fallout TV show led to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-sales/">bump in sales for Fallout 4,</a> and HBO's The Last of Us led to a massive spike in sales for both The Last of Us games. The Super Mario Bros. movie increased the sales of Mario games and Nintendo merchandise. As The Game Business points out, the Gran Turismo movie, the Halo TV show, and the Five Nights at Freddy's film all boosted game sales and engagement for the games they were adapted from.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Minecraft movie is the latest to participate in this trend, and it is another sign that the video game industry is very interested in keeping these adaptations going, just as Hollywood is excited to have finally found a way to mine a new bevy of popular series that'll help fill seats in movie theatres.</p>
