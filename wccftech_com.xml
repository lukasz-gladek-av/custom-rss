			<p>EA has announced that it will not release F1 26 in the coming year; instead, EA Sports F1 25 will get a major expansion meant to cover the 2026 Formula 1 season, with the series returning to its regular mainline release in 2027 with EA Sports F1 27.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">announced in a blog post on the EA website</a>, in which EA claims the decision was made "<em>as part of a strategic reset for the F1 franchise</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following on from F1 25’s commercial and critical success - with praise from players, media, content creators, and F1 drivers alike - the team is building on the experience through a paid expansion," </em>the post reads.<em> "The premium content update will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The decision to offer a premium content update for F1® 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1® Franchise. In 2027, a new game will be released that looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 ANNOUNCEMENT 🚨</p><p>EA SPORTS will release a paid expansion for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/F125?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#F125</a> in 2026, with the current game serving as the foundation for the 2026 season.</p><p>Additionally, 2027 will see the release of a new, reimagined EA SPORTS F1 title, that looks, feels, and plays differently.</p><p>📕 Read… <a href="https://t.co/Rk8hOmT1Yw">pic.twitter.com/Rk8hOmT1Yw</a></p></div>— EA SPORTS F1 (@EASPORTSF1) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSF1/status/1990813568325857352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Codemasters senior creative director, Lee Mather, added, <em></em><em>"We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world.</em>"</p>



<p>With Codemasters taking a year off in many ways to get ready for the next full release in 2027, it'll be interesting to see what the jump between F1 25 and F1 27 looks like. Also, regarding next year's big paid expansion for F1 25, meant to cover the 2026 F1 season, the price that expansion releases at will likely make or break the success of this experiment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after Krafton <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-owner-krafton-outlines-plans-to-transform-into-an-ai-first-company">affirmed its commitment to becoming an "<em>AI-first</em>" company</a>, the latest pre-trial document in the legal dispute between the co-founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds alleges that Krafton's chief executive officer, Changham Kim, looked to ChatGPT to see if there was a way out of paying developers at Unknown Worlds their <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus</a> that started this whole debacle.</p>



<p>The saga between the co-founders of Unknown Worlds (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) and Krafton is one of 2025's longer and more surprising stories. It's doubtful that anyone could have predicted that we'd get the most legal drama from a case that has everything an onlooker could ask for; high financial stakes, the concept of a big company versus a small band of creators, and a fandom caught in the middle, unsure of which side to believe.</p>



<p>Krafton has made several claims about the co-founders, including that they abandoned their roles at Unknown Worlds, that they had stolen from Krafton and from Unknown Worlds, that they would have willingly sabotaged the reputation of the studio they founded just to receive a big payout.</p>



<p>The co-founders have hit Krafton with allegations of their own, like alleging that Krafton management was purposely sabotaging Unknown Worlds to delay Subnautica 2's early access launch in the hopes of Unknown Worlds missing its window to earn the $250 million bonus, and that CEO Changham Kim even admitted to the co-founders that it would be "<em>disastrous</em>" and <em>"hugely embarrassing</em>" for Krafton if it were to pay Unknown Worlds the massive bonus.</p>



<p>There's a full recap of events at the bottom of this article, with bullet points listing everything that has happened so far, with links to our coverage of it all if you want to catch up. For now, we'll stick with what's new, which deals in particular with that last allegation from the co-founders about Krafton CEO Changham Kim.</p>



<p>Though Krafton denies that Kim admitted it would be a financial disaster for Krafton should it have to pay the bonus, the pre-trial brief (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-accused-of-forming-secret-taskforce-project-x-to-seize-control-of-unknown-worlds">publicly available via Game Developer</a>) alleges that Krafton took direct steps to avoid paying the bonus not just for financial reasons, but because Kim felt it would be "<em>a professional embarrassment</em>" and that he and Krafton would be seen as "<em>a pushover</em>" if it paid the bonus. </p>



<p>The attempt to avoid the bonus was allegedly called "<em>Project X,"</em> and the brief also alleges that firing the co-founders was part of Kim's attempts to avoid paying the bonus. Kim even went so far as to ask ChatGPT if there was a way out of paying the bonus, which tracks considering Krafton is trying to front itself as an AI and Generative AI-forward company.</p>



<p>"<em>Desperate to avoid such a professional embarrassment</em>," the pre-trial brief reads, "<em>Kim obsessed over finding a way to avoid Krafton's obligation to pay the earnout. [Maria] Park told Kim that 'it seems to be highly likely that the earn-out will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be 'difficult to cancel the earn-out.' But Kim was undeterred</em>."</p>



<p>The brief goes on to list Krafton's milestone check-ins with Unknown Worlds as the first step in what Kim believed to be the solution to his alleged problem, delaying the launch of Subnautica 2. Krafton would allegedly use the check-ins as the foundation to start its campaign that the game should be delayed.</p>



<p>That was only the beginning of 'Project X,' though, as the brief further alleges that Krafton's executive class was essentially planning a coordinated campaign to avoid paying the earnout by any and all means available to them, including seizing control of Unknown Worlds' website and social media channels and embarking on a "<em>Take-Over Scenario</em>" backup plan if the co-founders did not agree to Krafton's attempts to alter the earnout deal.</p>



<p>The brief also goes after one of Krafton's main claims about the co-founders, which is that they were allegedly abandoning their posts. Krafton has tried to use Charlie Cleveland's involvement in filmmaking as proof that he wasn't doing his job, but the pre-trial brief includes Slack messages that allegedly prove Krafton was fully aware of Cleveland's filmmaking efforts and was even considering making them an official part of his role <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/subnautica-2-could-be-getting-a-tv-show-or-movie/">as the potential for a Subnautica film grew</a>.</p>



<p>Suffice to say, nothing in this pre-trial brief from the co-founders' legal team looks good for Krafton, though that's also what it's supposed to do. For Krafton's part, <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-chatgpt-2000644792">in a statement shared with Kotaku</a>, the company denies the claims in the pre-trial brief and claims that its first commitment has always been to deliver "<em>the best possible game to Subnautica fans</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>At the heart of every decision Krafton makes are the fans who deserve the best possible experience. Krafton made leadership changes at Unknown Worlds when the now-former executives focused on other priorities rather than </em><em>Subnautica 2</em>," the statement reads<em>. "Despite Krafton offering to extend the former executives’ earnout period if they returned to their positions, the former executives refused to return to work, and improperly retained hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents both just before and after they were terminated." </em></p>



<p>"<em>Additionally, they failed to preserve certain files after their employment ended. Through this court process, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to </em><em>Subnautica</em>’s fans. Krafton will continue to present the evidence proving that the former executives did not comply with their duties as the legal proceedings move forward."</p>



<p>Needless to say, this will be an extremely interesting case to follow once it gets to trial. We'll keep you updated on it as it continues to evolve.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you need a recap on this whole saga, here's a timeline with everything save for today's news to catch you up:</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton.</li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>.</li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>



<li>On September 19, a report revealed that the court denied two of Krafton's motions, and Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemingly U-turned on one of its key arguments</a> regarding why the co-founders were fired in the first place.</li>



<li>On September 24, new motions from Krafton alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-subnautica-blueprint/">the founders stole what Krafton called "<em>effectively, a blueprint</em>"</a> for Subnautica in an attempt to further its argument that the co-founders intended to release Subnautica 2 on their own.</li>
