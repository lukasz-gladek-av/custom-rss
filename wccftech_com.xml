			<p><strong>Remedy</strong> has delivered <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-remastered-pc-update-2026/">a new update</a> for <strong>Alan Wake Remastered</strong> on PC, and it is arguably one of the most significant updates the game has received in a long time, because this update finally adds <strong>HDR</strong> to the PC version.</p>



<p>The addition of HDR is the big highlight, but it's not the only one in terms of visuals and some much-needed quality of life updates. For speedrunners and anyone who simply loves the game and is playing it again for the umpteenth time, you can now <strong>skip the intro cutscene</strong> to get into the game faster. Not that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-remastered-the-plot-thickens/">Alan Wake</a> is a game where you want to be skipping cutscenes (especially if you're playing it for the first time), but for veterans it's a much-welcomed addition.</p>



<p>Update version 1.33 also includes improved <strong>DLSS</strong> support, fixes an issue with FOV scaling, unlocks the framerate further so you can now play it at <strong>240FPS</strong> if you've got the right hardware, and fixed some polygonal rendering errors and depth buffer issues which, according to the patch notes, "<em>has <strong>greatly reduced the amount of visual glitches</strong></em>."</p>



<p>The update also brings some fixes for ultrawide users, improves the DX12 rendering path, and introduces some UI fixes. The star of the show though for this update is, once again, the addition of HDR, particularly because it comes from one of the video game industry's biggest HDR advocates.</p>

<p><strong>Filippo Tarpini</strong> is a veteran graphics programmer who has worked in the video game industry for years and is a huge advocate for HDR implementation in video games, many of which still arrive without support for the feature.<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/"> </a>Wccftech spoke<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/"> </a>with Tarpini this past December about HDR and the state of the feature as it relates to the video game industry, and how he's trying to push for it to be adopted more broadly.</p>



<p>"<em>I believe that somehow gamers aren’t aware of the value HDR adds to the gaming experience," </em>Tarpini told Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo.<em> "Marketing pushes you to care about having the hottest GPU, but nobody is advertising HDR, given there's no single producer behind it. GPU manufacturing companies often approach game studios with proposals to implement Ray Tracing or features exclusive to their GPUs, but none of that happens for HDR. For the reasons above, developers are under the impression that HDR is a niche technology and isn’t worth the effort. As of late 2025, that stance is very outdated!</em>"</p>

			<p>Yesterday, we learned that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-splinter-cell-far-cry-veteran-assassins-creed-hexe-creative-director-has-left-ubisoft/">Clint Hocking</a></strong>, the creative director on <strong>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</strong>, <strong>Far Cry 2,</strong> <strong>Watch Dogs: Legion</strong>, and most recently, the creative director behind the upcoming <strong>Assassin's Creed Hexe</strong>, had left <strong>Ubisoft</strong>. The newly named head of content for Assassin's Creed and former <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</strong> creative director, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-taps-senior-assassins-creed-black-flag-devs-to-lead-assassins-creed-future/">Jean Guesdon</a></strong>, is stepping in to fill his role on the project, which, according to a reliable Ubisoft insider, is showing a lot of promise within Ubisoft.</p>



<p>So much so that it's even the project that "<em><strong>everyone</strong></em>" across the company is looking to work on "<em>because of <strong>how good it's shaping up to be</strong></em>." The insider in question who made that comment is <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/2026713095071047980">Tom Henderson</a>, who noted it alongside Insider-Gaming's coverage of Hocking's departure. </p>



<p>"<em>Some folk will be wary of this change</em>," Henderson writes, "<em>but Assassin's Creed Hexe is the one project that everyone at Ubisoft wants to work on because of how good it's shaping up to be</em>."</p>

<p>So far, we know very little about Assassin's Creed Hexe. It was<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/"> announced in 2022</a> alongside a slew of upcoming titles for the series, and in the time since, all we have to go on about what to expect from the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-hexe-magic-powers-possession-fear-system/">are a few rumours</a>. Back in 2024, we heard that <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-servies-assassins-creed-red-hexe-in-2026/">it had been pushed into <strong>2026</strong></a>, but after Ubisoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> that was revealed last month, it could have easily been one of the projects that was pushed back further while Ubisoft works through this transition.</p>



<p>Regardless, Henderson's record when it comes to reporting on Ubisoft lends a lot of weight to his comments. Whether you're more pessimistic and figure that 'everyone' at Ubisoft wants to work on Hexe because they see it as a life raft to not get laid off during a tumultuous time for the company, or because they think it might be one of the best games Ubisoft has in the works right now, neither could be possible if it wasn't, as Henderson says, "<em>shaping up</em>" so well.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear more about Hexe soon.</p>
