			<p>After EA and Battlefield Studios teased <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-studios-ea-tease-naval-warfare-on-the-horizon-battlefield-6/">that they had heard players loud and clear</a> on requests for things like naval warfare, the return of Little Bird, platoons, and more coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/">Insider-Gaming</a> claims that at least when it comes to naval warfare, it's already in development and on its way into Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Insider-Gaming has based its report on datamined files it obtained, which include references to two boat vehicles. Unless these boats have wheels, or the files refer to boat skins that'll go on a tank, it's a clear indication that naval warfare is in the works.</p>



<p>The two files in question, per Insider-Gaming, are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_JetSki</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_RHIB</li>
</ul>



<p>'Glacier,' if you didn't already know, is the codename for Battlefield 6. 'MP' should be pretty self-explanatory as multiplayer, and the rest is obvious.</p>



<p>With naval warfare already being heavily teased by EA and Battlefield Studios, if/when it does arrive in Battlefield 6, it'll be yet another point towards how this latest iteration of Battlefield is shaping itself more like what players loved in Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and getting away from what we saw in Battlefield 2042, which, most Battlefield players would probably agree, is not at all a bad thing.</p>

			<p>Today, Archetype Entertainment has shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNkmV0gBClM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new EXODUS Founders Q&amp;A video</a>, which includes plenty new details about the game, and several new screenshots. Additionally, the game is now available for wishlisting on all major platforms: <a href="https://exodus.game/71y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://exodus.game/r3h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://exodus.game/3us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://exodus.game/rbn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>.</p>



<p>In the Founders Q&amp;A video, Studio Co-Founder &amp; General Manager Chad Robertson and Game Director Chris King answered several questions fielded by EXODUS fans. Regarding inspirations and influences, they admitted that Mass Effect was at the forefront for its deep narrative, branching choices, and continuity across sequels, but also mentioned Guerrilla's Horizon series for its elemental combat interactions and even Retro Studios' Metroid Prime when it comes to exploration, spatial puzzle solving, and the feeling of isolation.</p>



<p>When designing weaponry for the game, the studio employed the Swiss Army knife concept: Travelers don't have unlimited space for gear in their long voyages, so they must bring versatile multi-tools with them. For example, the so-called Recycler is both a salvage tool and a base gun. It can accept scavenged materials as ammo and transform for different purposes, giving players flexibility without managing many resources. </p>



<p>Archetype confirmed that stealth is a fully supported option in EXODUS. Players can stealth through encounters, go loud, or solve conflicts by talking. Ultimately, player agency was the studio's top priority, so multiple playstyles (including companions specialized for stealth and unique Aegis suits) are supported. In combat, players must observe, plan, and execute, but they must also often improvise as needed. Early game encounters will feature human factions and Celestial Constructs (robotic guardians of lost technology). After acquiring a spaceship, though, threats grow more complex and dangerous. For example, the 'Rot' is eventually introduced as a corrupting force for technology and the environment, not to mention a primary story antagonist affecting both enemies and planetary life.</p>



<p>As you would expect from a game inspired by Mass Effect, side quests were designed not to be filler missions. They deepen relationships with companions, offer skill upgrades, and enhance immersion in the universe of EXODUS. Protagonist Jun Aslan was created to be relatable, starting from modest origins and being initially unaware of their full potential. The studio aims for the player to see themselves in Jun. The protagonist's narrative progression will become more and more meaningful as their significance to humanity becomes clear.</p>

<p>At the heart of the story prepared by Archetype Entertainment there are powerful and mysterious Ancient Remnants artifacts. At first, Jun Aslan is driven to seek them to save their homeworld, but throughout the story, Jun will have to make difficult, morally complex decisions about their use. These moral choices are central and were written to be weighty, prompting reflection from the player's side.</p>



<p>It had been a while since we heard about EXODUS, following the debut of the first gameplay trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in December 2024</a>. However, the developers have promised more news and updates before the end of the year. We may see the game once again at The Game Awards: after all, <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was first unveiled there in 2023</a>. </p>

			<p>As individual games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-more-than-two-times-concurrent-players-on-steam-than-hades/">Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> break their own personal concurrent player count records on Steam, Valve's platform keeps breaking its own total concurrent player count records. In September 2024, Steam <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/">surpassed 38.4 million concurrent players</a>, breaking all previous records. Now, it's exceeded that record high by three million players, surpassing <strong>41.6 million concurrent players</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/steam-has-hit-a-new-all-time-record-with-over-41-million-ccus/">DSOGaming</a>, it seems that a mix of Battlefield 6 having a stellar launch between concurrent player counts on Steam and units sold, paired with the last Steam Next Fest event of the year kicking up, and chart-topping regulars like DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike staying consistent all helped push the PC gaming platform to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">41,666,455 concurrent players, per SteamDB</a> on October 12.</p>



<p>Since breaking the record, the player count hasn't gotten back to 40 million, but after first reaching 41 million players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/#1y">earlier this year in March</a>, it shows how Steam numbers are staying consistent, and with big releases like Battlefield 6, are pushing past previous records, even with <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-global-games-market-consoles-lead-growth-nintendo-switch-2/">analysts pointing towards console games as leading the video game industry's growth</a> in the near future.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the year's big releases continue to push concurrent player counts on Steam, and in the case of Battlefield 6, see if Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is able to match, if not best, the shooter series' major comeback. For more on Battlefield 6 ahead of Black Ops 7's launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-performance-benchmarks-wreck-havoc-break-stuff-with-solid-performance-on-all-gpus/">you can check out our benchmarking tests to ensure you're playing at the best settings for your setup</a>. </p>
