			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is still scheduled to be revealed and released this month, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, extremely reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">rumored</a> to launch yesterday, confirming that, as things stand, the game will still be released this month. Plans can obviously change, but with the insider's track record, it is safe to say that chances are high that we will soon be able to return to Cyrodiil soon, and experience it like we never did before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As things stand, yes.</p>
<p>â€” NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1907919010387370215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake has yet to be officially announced, we have known it has been in development in some capacity for <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">almost two years</a>, when the game's existence was revealed in an FTC investigational hearing held with Xbox's head Phil Spencer. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">rumors,</a> the remake is being developed by Virtuos in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> and will feature many new features and improvements over the original, including combat mechanics changes, some of them inspired by modern action games, HUD improvements, and more. If all of these changes will indeed be implemented in the final game, they should make for a far more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Those who haven't experienced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ahead of the remake still have the chance to do so on PC, as the GOTY edition, including all additional content, is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. Console players, unfortunately, have no other option at the moment other than playing the game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-explains-why-the-switch-2-has-an-lcd-screen-first-info-on-game-download-size-is-promising.1155126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-explains-why-the-switch-2-has-an-lcd-screen-first-info-on-game-download-size-is-promising/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen features&nbsp;<span>many advancements compared to the Switch 1. It's larger (7.9 inches versus 6.2) and has a higher resolution (1080p versus 720p). It also supports High Dynamic Range and Variable Refresh Rate (the latter through NVIDIA G-SYNC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as confirmed yesterday by NVIDIA</a>), with a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz</span>.</p>
<p>However, it is not an OLED screen, which means <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-oled-model-feels-like-more-than-a-toy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch OLED</a> users (who were also blessed with a larger 7-inch screen) may feel like it's a bit of a downgrade when it comes to the lack of infinite contrast and truly inky blacks. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-decided-to-go-from-the-switch-oled-to-an-lcd-screen-for-switch-2-after-a-lot-of-consideration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>,&nbsp;Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager of the Technology Development Division and Senior Director of the Technology Development Department at Nintendo, explained:</p>
<p><em>Now there's a lot of advancements that have been made in LCD technology during development. We took a look at the technology that was available to us now and after a lot of consideration we decided to stick to LCD.</em></p>
<p>In all honesty, many fans are simply convinced that Nintendo is waiting to release a more expensive OLED model a couple of years down the line. On the upside, at least there's a cheaper LCD model available with this approach.</p>
<p>On another note, as spotted <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/preeliminary-switch-2-game-file-sizes-revealed-mk-world-23-4-gb-donkey-kong-bananza-10-gb.1155054/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on ResetEra</a>, the Japanese My Nintendo Store already includes preliminary information on how much space will be needed to install Nintendo Switch 2 games on the new console.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Kart World - 23.4 GB</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Bananza - 10.0 GB</li>
<li>GameCube Nintendo Classics - 3.5 GB</li>
<li>Super Mario Jamboree Switch 2 Edition - 7.7 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>There's definitely an increase when it comes to the required install space compared to the Switch. However, we are nowhere near the size of most PC, PlayStation, and Xbox games, which approach or even surpass 100GB nowadays. On the flip side, those platforms have much larger drives available, whereas the Switch 2 only has 256GB (albeit expandable with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microSD Express format</a>).</p>

			<p>As promised, CAPCOM has released the first major Monster Hunter Wilds update today. On Steam, the update is a 6GB download or 16GB if you have high-resolution textures installed. There are a lot of bug fixes, of course, but the main highlights are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>New monsters can now be hunted after meeting certain in-game conditions.</li>
<li>Mizutsune has been added. Reach HR 21 to unlock an extra mission that can be started by speaking to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp. Complete the mission to unlock Mizutsune.</li>
<li>Tempered Mizutsune has been added and will appear when you are HR 41+ after completing the Mizutsune extra mission.</li>
<li>Zoh Shia has been added as a high-rank monster. Reach HR 50 to unlock a story mission that unlocks Zoh Shia.</li>
<li>New story, extra, and side missions have been added to Monster Hunter Wilds.</li>
<li>New weapons, armor, and skills have been added.</li>
<li>The upgrade limit has been increased for armor of rarity 5 and above.</li>

<li>The following features have been added to the Grand Hub: Barrel Bowling; the Diva; Arena Quest Counter; the Canteen; the Arm Wrestling Barrel.</li>
<li>The Expedition Record Board has been added to the Grand Hub, along with rankings for time attack quests.</li>
<li>Arena Quests have been added.</li>
<li>Challenge Quests and Free Challenge Quests (Challenge Quests with no equipment restrictions) have been added and will be made available at a later date.</li>
<li>New status ailments have been added.</li>
<li>New voice lines for Alma (the Handler) have been added.</li>
<li>An arena log page has been added to hunter profiles.</li>
<li>The Change Appearance menu in the camp now has an option to change Alma's outfit.</li>
<li>New pop-up camp gear options have been added.</li>
<li>New limited bounty categories have been added.</li>
<li>New voice lines, pose sets, and gestures have been added.</li>
<li>Preparations have been made for the Festival of Accord, planned to run from April 23 to May 6.</li>
<li>The following features will be temporarily modified during the Festival of Accord: the Handler's Outfit; Seikret decoration; the Diva's song list; the Grand Hub decorations; the Canteen's menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a limited-time Event Quest where hunters can head to the Ruins of Wyveria and face a Guardian Doshaguma in "Anguish and Atrocity". Successfully completing the quest will see them earn extra Hunter Rank Points. The Event Quest is available until April 8 at 4:59 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>By the way, the developer warned players of a known issue where the game crashes when talking to Nata and selecting Sekka to trade items at the Village Intermediary. The current workaround requires waiting a certain amount of time or resting at the BBQ Menu.</p>
<p>CAPCOM has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds broke the publisher's all-time records for first-month sales, with over 10 million units sold across all platforms. It is, therefore, well on its way to surpassing its predecessor, Monster Hunter World, which currently leads with 21.30 million units sold; still, the developer's continued support with patches and DLCs will be critical to reaching that objective.</p>
