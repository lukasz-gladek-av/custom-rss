			<p>Since December, or more accurately, since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, there’s been a feeling that Xbox has turned a corner for the better. Following up MachineGames' excellent Indiana Jones adventure was Obsidian, with a more than solid outing in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a>. Which, in a few days from the time of publishing, will be followed up by Compulsion Games’ latest, <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/">South of Midnight</a>, which hopes to keep that momentum going.</p>
<p>South of Midnight is the third game in the studio’s history since its founding in 2009 and the first full game the team has made primarily under the Xbox banner after it was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. After the studio’s last batch of DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-happy-fews-last-dlc-we-all-fall-down-is-out-on-november-19th/">We Happy Few</a>, the six years since have been spent crafting Hazel and her mother Lacey’s story, complete with stop-motion animation. The Southern gothic tale begins with a hurricane far worse than anyone in her small fictional town of Prospero could have predicted and a fight between Hazel and Lacey.</p>
<p>After storming out of the house, Hazel looks on in horror as she watches the hurricane take her home, with her Mom in it, down the river. While chasing after the floating house to try and save her Mom, Hazel is chosen to become a new Weaver. A Weaver is a person who is able to see the strings and strands that make up what the game calls the Grand Tapestry. Basically, it is the fabric of life and the world, and it’s now Hazel’s job to help untangle the knots caused by the tragedy and pain we experience in life, either by choices of our own making or at the hands of evil people.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-1.png"></a></figure>

<p>The story in South of Midnight is a bit of an odd thing. Hazel’s journey toward understanding her Mom better and how their story plays out is kind of the least interesting part. At the same time, the game’s story is one of its strengths, and that all comes from the people you meet along Hazel’s journey to finding her Mom. South of Midnight’s story constantly surprised me because, from the outside, you wouldn’t guess that this game is nearly as dark or serious as it is. In each chapter, you’ll be charged with helping someone put the pain of their worst memories to rest by untangling the knot the bad parts of their lives caused.</p>
<p>And in each chapter, I was taken aback with just how intense and tragic all of these memories were. It was actually what helped to keep the story grounded, especially in the moments where Hazel is wall-running on a floating wall that looks like it’s been ripped off the side of a building.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>That’s not to say the relationship between Hazel and her Mom was boring or entirely uninteresting, just that it was out-shined by every other story told, whether in a short scene of a memory you witness or an old journal entry you find along the path. It also didn’t help that, more often than not, Hazel’s first words just after witnessing the memory of an extremely tragic event rarely fit the moment, with too many of her lines sounding like generic barks you might hear in any video game where the protagonist is constantly commenting on the world around them.</p>
<p>But there are a few moments of real, excellent storytelling with strong performances from the entire voice cast, including the voice behind Hazel, Adriyan Rae. This only made it all the more upsetting when Hazel would have a line that felt like she wasn’t paying attention to the events she just witnessed. Still, even with those disappointing moments, South of Midnight delivers an emotional story that packs a heavier punch than its bright visuals and stop-motion animation might have you expect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of its visuals, the art design and the look of South of Midnight is arguably the best part of this game. I don’t mean that as a slight towards other aspects, or that it’s not worth playing. It often feels like if the best thing you have to say about a game is that it looks nice, then it probably has little to offer beyond that. Not the case with South of Midnight, as it definitely brings more to the table, but the design of this game and the detail poured into every corner is absolutely spectacular.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stop-motion animation effect did not agree with my eyes, and I did have to turn it off after playing the opening few chapters with it. I think your mileage with that effect may vary since my issues with it could also be traced to the number of stuttering bugs I witnessed during my playthrough. I was playing an early build of the game on my Xbox Series X that did not include the day-one patch, so I can only hope that the issues I have will be sorted by the time everyone else can jump in for themselves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of jumping, good as the story and performances are, the main gameplay of South of Midnight is what’s unfortunately lacking. The platforming isn’t bad. But it also isn’t great, and even though it evolves somewhat throughout the 14 chapters of the game’s story, particularly with the sections that have you running from a dark fog, it only starts to get interesting by the time you’re on the last couple of chapters. And by that point, these sections had been so repetitive that I was more peeved than excited to go through another one. Even if the design of these sections was starting to get good, which shouldn’t be the case in chapter 12 of a 14-chapter game.</p>
<p>The combat is, unfortunately, the worst part of the gameplay. Put simply, it’s boring and repetitive, and it wouldn’t detract from the game so much if you weren’t thrust into a combat arena every five minutes. The small skill tree you work through never adds to the combat in interesting ways; the best part about upgrading your skills is that it can help you move through these sections faster. A key issue is that there’s no flow to combat. Hazel doesn’t have a parry or a block mechanic, so all you can do is dash and dodge away from incoming attacks, which means you’re constantly pulling yourself out of the action in order to stay alive. And whether you’re locked on to a single enemy or not, the camera is awful at keeping pace with the combat, so you’re almost surely going to take a few hits that you just couldn’t prepare for because you didn’t see them coming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-4.png"></a></figure>

<p>Even when an enemy is in front of you, some attacks are more telegraphed than others, and you can only knock an enemy out of an animation by performing a ground-pound attack. It also doesn’t help that when you do take a hit, the knock-back effect makes Hazel so slow to react that you’re likely to take another hit before you can dodge to safety. That’s also where all the ‘challenge’ in the combat lies, not dying from hits you can’t see coming. Which makes any deaths you suffer frustrating for the wrong reasons. Even when you are performing well and not dying, the feedback on your attacks doesn’t feel satisfying, as you repeat the same set of animations again and again. And while the look of each enemy is interesting, what each of them adds to combat doesn’t evolve it in interesting ways or make you change your approach. This then feeds into the other issue that you don’t really get many different ways to approach combat. You’re mashing attack and dodge ad-nauseam, and when it’s over, you get a tragic, emotional scene about something awful that happened in a character’s life. The actions couldn’t feel more disconnected if they tried, which adds to combat feeling like a slog.</p>
<p>South of Midnight would be a tighter, more interesting game if the combat sections were instead replaced with gameplay akin to that of an adventure game or puzzle game, where you’re piecing together the past events to properly untangle what has become knotted. The gameplay there would also more easily weave into the game’s narrative instead of feeling like it’s trying to be an entirely different kind of game the moment combat starts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-6-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If there are any combat sections I could call out as good, it would be the few boss fights scattered throughout the game. But those sections aren’t good because the combat suddenly becomes fun, they’re good because of the scale of the bosses you’re fighting, and how well executed the presentation of each set piece is. So even though getting through to the end of a chapter isn’t all that fun with how many combat sections you have to get through, at least the set piece at the end was always visually stunning and a fun spectacle.</p>
<p>That’s also why I’d say the best of these chapter-ending set-pieces is actually one that members of the press, including Wccftech’s own Kai Tatsumoto, got to experience in <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-hands-on-preview-bottling-up-the-trauma/">previews</a>. How the music tied in with the story you had just witnessed, and the complete understanding you have about this giant tree that you’re climbing, still sticks out in my mind, days after seeing the credits roll. It was really beautiful, and I wish more of the game was able to weave gameplay and narrative as strongly as it was done there.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-7-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lastly, speaking of the music, that is the final aspect of the storytelling that really makes South of Midnight special. The original songs written for each of the key characters from Prospero that you meet and help out are all so well done. It’s something you really have to experience for yourself, and it’s a big part of why I’d still recommend that you play South of Midnight. On top of the other visual and storytelling aspects I’ve already talked about, the music wraps it all together so beautifully.</p>

<p>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan.1154244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As excited as we all were to see the new features and specs for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and, of course, the games that Nintendo has in store for it, the price of the console was always going to be the biggest talking point coming out of Wednesday's Nintendo Direct presentation.</p>
<p>Which it certainly has been, due to just how high the price ended up being. $449.99 USD (or $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>) was not what gamers around the world wanted to read. Unless you happen to live in Japan, however, since Nintendo also revealed it will be selling a cheaper, Japan-only Switch 2 that's region-locked.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">VGC</a>, the 'Japanese-Language System' version of the Switch 2 will be available at <strong>49,980 yen</strong>, which works out closer to&nbsp;<strong>$334 USD.&nbsp;</strong>The version of the Switch 2 that supports multiple languages, which is the one everyone outside of Japan will be buying, will cost <strong>69,980 yen</strong>.</p>
<p>If you plan on going to Japan sometime after June 5, 2025, and have no trouble reading and understanding Japanese, then it's not entirely clear if you could purchase one of these consoles at the cheaper, Japan-only price, and take it back to your home country and continue to enjoy it there.</p>
<p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/">reports</a> that the console will only be "<em>linkable to [Nintendo] accounts with their country/region set to Japan,</em>" so, presumably, as long as you meet that requirement (and again, can read and understand Japanese), you could get the Switch 2 for more than $100 less than you would have otherwise paid. Though surely the trip to Japan, or shipping the Japanese-only Switch 2 out of the country to wherever you live, will fill that gap quickly enough.</p>
<p>As to why Nintendo is adopting this two-tiered pricing model for Japan only, Ahmad has a few common-sense theories.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">To discourage reselling of the new system by foreign buyers who leverage the console’s lower price point in the country to resell the title to regions with a higher price – an issue faced by the first Nintendo</span></em> Switch," Ahmad writes.</p>
<p>He also adds, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">regarding the tariffs</a> announced by the United States and Donald Trump on Wednesday, that the difference in pricing between Japan and the United States particularly, is "<em>likely a calculated move on Nintendo’s part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen and local market conditions</em>."</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">Japan accounted for nearly 25% of global Nintendo Switch unit sales, with Nintendo offering a cheaper Switch 2 SKU in this market to stimulate early adoption and maintain</span></em> <em>momentum</em>," he continues.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.</span></em>"</p>
<p>At least Ahmad does end on a more positive note, saying that he does not believe Nintendo will raise the price of the console within the first five years of its lifetime.</p>

			<p>The full Monster Hunter Wilds 1.010.00.00 patch notes have been revealed, confirming the new content and changes coming to the latest entry in the series ahead of the patch's release in a few hours.</p>
<p>Besides highlighting the return of series' classic monster Mizustune, its Tempered variant, and the Zoh Shia high rank hunt, <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.010.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the patch notes</a> revealed some previously unknown balance changes, which include the increase in guild points rewards for investigations, the increase of points required for Wyverian Melding and Meld Decorations functions at the Melding Pot, and Mantles rebalancing, including the previously announced nerfing of the Corrupted Mantle.</p>
<p>Among the changes to weapons, most have been left untouched, except for the Lance, which receives a change that makes it easier to land thrust attack finishers after a focus strike, and the Bow, which sees nerfs to Dragon Piercer and buffs to Power Volley and Thousand Dragons, among other things. Sadly, the patch notes don't reveal any unexpected performance improvements, other than the VRAM usage improvements and upgraded DirectStorage version confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-pc-improvements/">last week.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The physical release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> won't require an additional download to run, as the entire game will be included in the cart.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, CD Projekt Red's Vice President of Business Jan Rosner confirmed the game will ship on a 64 GB cart that includes both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, so no additional download will be required to run the game. The game will launch the same day the Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide for the price of $69.99, €69.99.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available on June 5th. SRP is $69.99/€69.99. The game will be distributed on a 64GB game card (containing the game and expansion, no download required), as well as via digital download from Nintendo eShop for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>— Jan Rosner (@jan_rosner) <a href="https://twitter.com/jan_rosner/status/1907780644131799153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the time, we haven't seen much of Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition running on Nintendo Switch 2 besides the short trailer shown during yesterday's Nintendo Direct, but it seems like a high refresh rate experience is out of the cards, even in docked mode. Earlier today, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier confirmed, after a hands-on session, that the game runs at 40 FPS in Performance Mode with the console docked, which is definitely disappointing for those who expected a 60 FPS mode, but not completely unexpected, considering how demanding the game can be.</p>

<p lang="en">Some other Switch 2 observations:<br>
- The "Welcome Tour" app is surprisingly cool (one minigame reminded me of Mario Paint) and it is insane that Nintendo is charging for it<br>
- Metroid looks and feels fantastic<br>
- Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 40fps in performance mode while docked (oof)</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition launches on June 5th on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>
