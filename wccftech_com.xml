			<p>It's no secret that Marvel Games and PlayStation's Insomniac Games have a good relationship. We wouldn't have three <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man games</a> and one upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">Marvel's Wolverine game</a> without a strong relationship between both companies, and in a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/11/04/general-manager-sheds-light-on-future-of-marvel-games">Game Informer</a>, we got a bit more insight into just how good Marvel feels about the relationship.</p>



<p>General manager of Marvel Games, Haluk Mentes, spoke at length about the importance of Marvel Games and the studios it collaborates with being aligned in their approach to making anything with Marvel characters, and making something that is authentically Marvel.</p>



<p>"<em>The challenge is more complex: authenticity doesn't necessarily mean one-to-one fidelity to source or reference material, whether it's comics or animation or movies. It's much deeper in that we allow our collaborating teams to reimagine 'familiar yet original' incarnations of our characters based on their own creative DNA...We absolutely do not want to be derivative. Otherwise, what's the point of working with some of the best talent out there?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>There’s a great sense of responsibility at play here: Marvel is an almost 90-year-old creative brand, yet it’s as fresh as ever because during all that time, each new generation grew up with Marvel, ultimately became creators and left their mark, and then passed the torch to the next generation.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We also actively seek collaborators that want to take on the same mantle. As is usually the case, once we complete a project together, they, too, become “Marvel.” Marvel’s Wolverine with our dear friends at Insomniac Games is perhaps the epitome of this philosophy. We have been working together for more than a decade and developed such a shorthand across multiple Marvel’s Spider-Man games that when the time finally came to bring Logan back in spectacular and visceral fashion, it was obvious to everyone on our team that Insomniac was the perfect choice. It was our shared culture and values that brought us together, and we’re so proud to continue collaborating for many years to come.</em>"</p>

			<p>After it was first announced in April 2024, and after a public demo and beta tests, developer Loric Games has given its open-world airship-building survival game, Echoes of Elysium, an early access release date. It'll arrive on PC on Steam on December 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Loric Games confirmed the news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2644050/view/563639088757867952?l=english">in a post on the game's Steam page</a>, which also included a new trailer featuring some cinematic looks at gameplay.</p>



<p>"<em>Echoes of Elysium has been a dream project for us</em>," said Loric Games co-founder, Ray Soto. "<em>We wanted to build a world that feels alive, one where you can build, explore, and truly feel free in the skies. That moment when your ship lifts off for the first time...it's pure</em> <em>magic</em>."</p>

<p>Early this year, ahead of Echoes of Elysium participating in one of this year's Steam Next Fest events, I got the chance <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-hands-on-preview-the-skys-the-limit/">to preview Echoes of Elysium and check out the demo ahead of its public release</a>, and hear a presentation from the developers. I spent a fair bit of time with the game then, and while its sky-high setting felt like both a pro and a con, I went away looking forward to seeing the game evolve further. At the time, I wrote, "<em>If you like MMO survival crafting games and a bit of ship building, then it's worth your time to check out the demo when it's available, but for now, the sky being the only limit to Echoes of Elysium is both a bit of a blessing and a curse. Hopefully, one day it's just a blessing.</em>"</p>



<p>I wouldn't be surprised to jump in at early access and see it still struggling with some of the issues I highlighted in my preview, but the benefit of its early access state is that we know it'll evolve and improve over time. As I said before, if you're already into open-world survival games like this, Echoes of Elysium at least looks like one to keep an eye on.</p>
