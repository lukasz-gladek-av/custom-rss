			<p>Game developer and publisher Maximum Entertainment has announced a new first-person sniper simulation game titled Center Mass: Streets of Ramadi. It was developed in collaboration with Brandon Webb, a former SEAL Sniper course Head Instructor, to achieve a realistic gaming experience. As a SEAL sniper, you'll navigate high-stakes environments, operate lifelike weapon systems, and rely on your skill to complete dynamic, high-stakes objectives under pressure.</p>
<p>Players will have the opportunity to conduct advanced training in long-range shooting in various environmental conditions that influence the elevation and wind compensations. They'll also get to master tactical techniques such as milling, stalking, and creating hides.</p>
<p>They will perform authentic interactions with their sniper rifles, from manual scope adjustments to bolt operation and a full suite of ballistics influenced by weather, distance, and ammunition types.</p>
<p>Center Mass: Streets of Ramadi takes place in the titular city located in the Al-Anbar province of Iraq. Here, players will explore anything from urban enclaves to open farm grounds, with locations inspired by real operations made by the SEAL team. Mission types will include&nbsp;Special Reconnaissance, Area Surveillance, Overwatch, and High-Value Target neutralization.</p>
<p>Maximum Entertainment promises 'endless replayability' thanks to emergent events such as ambushes and IED discoveries. The game also supports an online cooperative mode where players team up with a spotter to communicate, strategize, and control the battlefield. While one player focuses on communications, intel, and firing solution calculations, the other executes high-stakes precision shots with no room for error. Over the course of the game, it will be possible to unlock new weapon systems, attachments, and equipment.</p>

			<p>This week, those who are interested are being given the opportunity to try out Escape from Tarkov: Arena. The free weekend will be starting on December 20 at 4 AM ET / 1 AM PT / 9 AM GMT and will finish on December 23. This gives you enough time to experiment and have fun in Escape From Tarkov: Arena and see if this is <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-standalone-game-gets-new-teaser/">a game</a> for you. If this is something you want to get stuck into, all you have to do is register on the <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and then install the launcher. From there, you'll be good to go and will get to participate in the free weekend.</p>
<p>As an additional gift for participating in the free weekend, players will all receive a unique Snowman T-Shirt, which is rewarded to players who complete the special quest given to them. Regardless of whether you own the game after the free weekend is over, the item will remain in your account permanently, which also includes being in the original Escape from Tarkov.</p>
<p>During this event, there will also be a small Twitch Drops campaign, which will allow you to get some free extra rewards by watching streams in the game's category. This includes rewards such as in-game currency and exclusive holiday-themed Oakley SI Gascan White Glasses and the Winter half-mask to wear while battling it out for survival in Tarkov's arenas.</p>
<p>Along with the free weekend, Patch 0.16.0.0 will be released for Escape From Tarkov. When this patch is released, all data on the server will be wiped. This is because the game will then be transferred over to the 2022 Unity engine, along with sound system improvements and a refresh of several locations within the game.</p>
<p>Once this has happened, the Winter Drops Event will take place, and players will be able to get their hands on some more goodies in-game to kit them out and give them the festive spirit.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't any details about the upcoming patch, but it's been confirmed that details regarding the patch and the full schedule for the Winter Drops Event will be announced soon so that you can keep up to date with what's happening in Escape from Tarkov.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Escape from Tarkov: Arena?</p>
