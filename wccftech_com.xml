			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft laid off 9,000 employees</a> across the entire company yesterday, with an unknown number of those cuts impacting the Xbox and gaming division. Part of these cuts are<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/"> reportedly directly related to Microsoft's push into AI</a>, and some of those impacted by the cuts are speaking out about how <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/">Microsoft is doing its "<em>damndest</em>"</a> to replace people with AI as fast as it can. </p>



<p>You might think, then, that at least for a day, possibly even a few days, Microsoft would post-pone any more pushing of its AI technology into the faces of developers, publicly or privately. Not the case, it would seem, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-gen-ai-idxbox-layoffs-npc-chatgpt-1851785609">Kotaku</a> spotted that Necrosoft Games director, Brandon Sheffield, shared the beginnings of an email he received from Microsoft and ID@Xbox, inviting him to a roundtable at Gamescom 2025 where Microsoft will be talking up using "<em>AI in our tools and processes to make the game development and publishing experience more efficient</em>."</p>







<p>Below Sheffield's post, other developers shared their response to getting the same invitation, with Toronto-based developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminrivers.bsky.social/post/3lt36vjygks2t">Benjamin Rivers saying</a> "<em>just get wrecked, mates</em>." Sheffield agreed, "<em>they really should</em>."</p>



<p>While reports of the total layoffs at Microsoft have the number at 9,000, the exact amount of people impacted in the gaming division remains unclear at this time of writing. Meanwhile, these layoffs have left the talented workers and developers out of a job due to poor decisions made by a c-suite of executives who, for some reason still have their jobs, despite the fact that thousands of layoffs is a clear sign they messed up along the way, and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/">pushed out veteran developers</a> who contain a wealth of knowledge that the AI tools Microsoft is pushing cannot hope to replace.</p>



<p>This is just a shot in the dark, but it seems like decisions that don't lead to wasting and mismanaging talent that has been in this industry for years would be the more efficient route towards successful game development, instead of AI tools that have, so far, proven capable costing a lot of money.</p>

			<p>Anthem is going offline forever next year, EA and BioWare have announced, as the failed third-person shooter will have its servers shut down on <strong>January 12, 2026</strong>, nearly seven years since it launched in 2019.</p>



<p>You'd be forgiven if you thought Anthem's servers had already been shut down. The response online shows several people expressing surprise that the game is still playable. Even Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo thought the game was six-feet-under by now. </p>



<p>That's not the case though, and in fact, we now know that the chances to play Anthem, should you wish to revisit <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">EA's failed attempt at forcing BioWare</a> to make a game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-was-a-key-lesson-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-says-bioware/">the studio even admitted was not its forte</a>, are numbered. </p>



<p>At one point, it looked like Anthem's failure to launch could be salvaged. Its<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/anthem-flying-high-it-doesnt-last/"> release was a mixed bag</a>, to say the least, with some aspects of the game being truly memorable, with most who were around to try it remembering how good the flying mechanics felt. The rest of the game, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-anthem-below-expectations-will-support/">did not reach those same heights</a>, and the extent to which BioWare was out of its element was almost palpable. Still, work was put in to try and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-2-0-shooting-looting-redesign-more-satisfying/">find a path forward for Anthem</a>, as EA couldn't seem to let it go as easily as it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard,</a> for example.</p>



<p>Development on Anthem 2.0 <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-next-cancelled/">officially stopped in 2021</a>, and since then, the game has sat on EA's servers, collecting dust, it would seem, until someone found it and was no doubt surprised to find it was still active. </p>



<p>"<em>We have an important update to share regarding Anthem</em>," EA began in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">blog post on the game's official website</a>. "<em>After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026. This means that the game will still be playable online for the next 180+ days. As of today, you can no longer purchase in-game premium currency, but you can still use your remaining balance until the servers go offline. We deeply appreciate your dedication, passion and support over the years and we'd like to thank you for that.</em>"</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Anthem is playable for another 193 days, to be exact. </p>
