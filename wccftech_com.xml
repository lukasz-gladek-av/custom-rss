			<p>Titanfall 3, the yet-to-be-announced new entry in the series by Respawn, will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will feature a wealth of play modes besides an Extraction mode that is said to be the game's main mode.</p>
<p>Earlier today, known Apex Legends leaker Osvaldatore revealed some additional details on the yet-to-be-announced game, revealing it will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and will feature, together with the aforementioned main Extraction mode, a single-player campaign and other play modes, including Team Deathmatch, Control, Arenas and all Titanfall 2 classic modes. Additionally, the game will see the return of characters from Apex Legends and feature a weather system and a live service approach to multiplayer with Battle Passes, which isn't surprising at all for a modern multiplayer game. As for when the game is releasing, the leaker did not say, but as development is almost complete, its release shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

<p>Titanfall 3 has been<a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-is-in-development-according-to-known-apex-legends-dataminer-rumor/"> rumored</a> to be in development multiple times since the release of the second entry in the series, but the game never actually materialized, making fans believe that the franchise was over and done. Hopes were reignited again<a href="https://wccftech.com/titanfall-3-isnt-dead-and-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2025-rumor/"> last week</a> when both Osvaldatore and Yorotsuki, another known Apex Legends leaker, revealed that the game is real and coming. According to the latter, the game will be revealed later this year during The Game Awards 2025 show, but hopefully, it won't take so long to learn if the series is indeed still alive and kicking.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-2-billion-year-revenue/">Xbox</a> and Microsoft have put a date on its summertime showcase, with the announcement that the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will be livestreamed on <strong>Sunday, June 8, 2025 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT.</strong></p>
<p>Similarly to how previous Xbox showcases have featured a Direct-like show on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-starfield-direct-breaks-viewership-records-for-xbox/">Starfield</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/">Call of Duty</a> immediately after the general showcase, it's The Outer Worlds 2's turn to get its own featured Direct following the rest of the showcase.</p>
<p>Beyond The Outer Worlds 2, Xbox isn't giving any hints yet as to what will be shown at this direct.&nbsp;<span>The June 8 date is, however, right towards the tail-end of<a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-comes-to-los-angeles-again-from-june-6-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Summer Game Fest 2025,</a> which takes place from June 6-9.</span> With how many bits of news and leaks happen around that time, we'll surely have a better idea of what this showcase will look like closer to the actual date.</p>
<p>Whether Microsoft tells us about what'll be shown or not, Xbox does mention that this Xbox Games Showcase will be just a digital live stream, meaning there won't be a physical show component to it as they've done in the past.</p>
<p>Xbox also clarifies that the games shown will be both from Xbox's "<em>first-party studios, in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe</em>," an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/">Xbox Wire</a> blog post reads.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is the sequel to the fairly successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 sci-fi roleplaying game</a> published by Private Division. This one, though, will be published by Xbox Game Studios, which means Obsidian will have enjoyed a higher budget during development. The expectations are certainly higher, especially after Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-is-looking-incredible-says-obsidian-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyped it up as something 'incredible'</a>.</p>
<p>Fans of the first game may be disappointed to learn that it will feature a new cast of characters. The journey will also take them to a new solar system.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-3-reload-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms.1159245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Atlus has announced that an extensive Persona 3 Reload demo is now available on all platforms. The demo allows would-be players to play through the story’s opening, leading up to the first major boss battle against a Shadow. It's a section of several hours, making it a rather meaty demo compared to the usual half-hour slice. Moreover, as usual with demos nowadays, you can play through the whole thing and then continue where you left off after you purchase the game.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload launched in early 2024 to critical and commercial acclaim. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 9 out of 10</a> by reviewer Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Persona 3 Reload is gorgeous; it looks like one of the more modern Persona titles, and it manages to bring this new visual overhaul without sacrificing what is one of the darker atmospheres you'll find in a game like this. It adds a fresh feel to the game while still keeping it familiar, which is something all remakes/reloads could remember to do. From brand-new models and portraits to new menus, ATLUS hasn't skimped.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, I want to say it plays immaculately on the Steam Deck. There are no hiccups; it is smooth, responsive, and looks fantastic. Overall, Persona 3 Reload is precisely as my title says: "a remake as it should be". Yes, aspects are missing from previous versions, so you couldn't arguably call this a definitive edition of Persona 3. Still, in my opinion, it's undoubtedly the best version of Persona 3 you'll find.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after the game's debut, Atlus <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-is-the-fastest-selling-game-in-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted</a> that it was the fastest-selling game in the whole Persona franchise. We know it has sold one million copies in its first week, though there haven't been any updated sales figures since.</p>
