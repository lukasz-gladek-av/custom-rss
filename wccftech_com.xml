			<p>Infold Games has confirmed that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/">cozy open-world adventure gacha game</a>, Infinity Nikki, will be making its way to Steam. This is an ongoing effort from the developers to help make the game more accessible to a wider audience, as well as continue its efforts to engage with its community. For those who are excited about Infinity Nikki, the game is already available to wishlist on Steam. At the moment, there isn't a set release date for when the title will be playable via Steam, but it will be coming in the future.</p>
<p>Since the game was initially released on December 5, 2024, Infinity Nikki has taken the gaming world by storm. Players worldwide have been gathering in Mirawish to unlock new outfits and complete the story. So far, there have been over 20 million downloads worldwide. With the release of the game on Steam, that number will surely grow, with more players being able to access Infinity Nikki for the first time. The Steam version will also include seamless integration with the Infold account system, which will allow players to access their accounts and continue their progress across all available platforms.</p>
<p>Once the game is released on Steam, players will have access to the full range of features, which includes achievements, controller support, and social integration. Thus far, there is no mention on the Steam page about whether this game will be playable on Steam Deck, or whether there will be plans to make the game compatible with the Steam Deck at a later date.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Infinity Nikki has been incredibly popular, receiving critical acclaim for the blend of gameplay, merging dress-up gameplay with open-world questing, platforming, and puzzles along the way. Players will get to explore the expansive world of Miraland, where there are beautiful landscapes providing many opportunities for virtual photography, along with some fun and simple combat. Players can also expect to solve puzzles to get Whimstars, get to fuss over adorable pets, and uncover some of Miraland's hidden secrets, such as the paper cranes and ghost trains.</p>
<p>Updates are released frequently for Infinity Nikki, adding new outfits, quests, and banners to pull from for those who engage with the gacha mechanics. The game is entirely free to play, with optional microtransactions that have the potential to provide you with more outfits and customization for Nikki.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Infinity Nikki once it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases on Steam</a>? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>Having the most powerful console is a message that no longer works in the current console market, according to the creator of Xbox, as it was a story that only worked in the past for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/?callback=in&amp;code=MZY2ZJDMZDUTOWJKMY0ZYMRHLWE4YZUTZDU1ZWE2ZMQ5YMMZ&amp;state=f568e241a61f4d22b9243c504e3ba67e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoGamer,</a> the creator of the original Microsoft console Seamus Blackley commented on how having the most powerful console back in the original Xbox and PlayStation 2 generation was important, but not so much nowadays, as in that console generation, we were still in the <em>"nascent stages of graphics,"</em> and taking a hit in the cost of goods of the cogs was critical to position the system against the Japanese consoles, one-up them in this regard, and bet on the games being better.</p>
<p>Despite the narrative that having the most powerful console may have helped, the reason to buy any console has always been about the content, and the Xbox creator thinks this hasn't changed at all. What has changed is that this battle for the content has moved away from any sort of technical achievement and is now centered on creating a sort of experience that gets people to want it, regardless of what sorts of visuals it can push. The Nintendo Switch is the prime example of this, as with its content, Nintendo managed to get people to purchase a console released in 2017 powered by underclocked 2013 hardware.</p>
<p>The Xbox creator's statements don't come as a surprise to anyone who has been keeping tabs on the gaming industry. With Microsoft pushing its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/">multiplatform strategy</a>, bringing former Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, and some developers suggesting <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-will-eventually-abandon-console-exclusives/">Sony may follow suit</a>, the importance of content over hardware is becoming increasingly clear, and with future home consoles unlikely to offer <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-smaller-performance-gains-higher-prices/">massive leaps in visual fidelity without significant price increases that could limit their appeal</a>, making compelling content is set to become more crucial than ever, regardless of the platform.</p>

			<p>Gears of War E-Day may not be too far from release, judging by how long it has already been in development.</p>
<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/VGTGamingNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGT Gaming News</a>, the game's Senior Level Designer revealed on LinkedIn that the new entry in the popular series has been in active development for five years and two months already. As such, its release may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Gears of War E-Day was announced last year during Microsoft's usual summer showcase, but very little has been said about the game since its reveal. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-playstation-release/">job ad</a> discovered shortly after the game's announcement suggests that the game could be headed to PlayStation 5 at some point, which has become less surprising since the ad has been discovered, as it has been highlighted multiple times by Xbox execs, including Phil Spencer, that<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/"> there are no red lines</a> regarding bringing Xbox games to other consoles and any game could be considered for a console multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Gears of War E-Day is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X|S. A final release date, or the launch on any other platform besides those that have been announced, has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>
