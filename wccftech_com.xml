			<p>The latest season of Rocket League is on the horizon, as announced in a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/rocket-league-season-18-springs-forth-futura-garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a>, and is set to begin on March 14 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 4 PM GMT. There are a lot of new changes coming with this approaching season, with a focus on a futuristic theme in the Futura Garden Arena, as well as other high-tech items that you can get to customize your car.</p>
<p>With a new season comes a new season pass, where you will automatically unlock the Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack Car Body. If you purchase the Rocket Pass, you'll also be able to obtain the Azura Car Body, Space Tower Antenna, Spaceship Topper, and Waypoint Trail. Those who log in during Season 18 will also unlock the Future Fashion Banner.</p>
<p>One of the major changes in this new Rocket League season is the new mutators that will be available to use in Exhibition Mode and Private Matches. Below is the full list of mutators that you'll be able to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jumps - From a double jump to an octuple jump, or no jumps allowed at all, the decision is yours.</li>
<li>Number of Balls - you can choose to have one, two, four, or six balls in play.</li>
<li>Ball Gravity - Options include low, high, super, and default gravitational pull.</li>
<li>Dodge Timer - Change the dodge timer.</li>
<li>Possession Score - Players can earn points by keeping possession of the ball.</li>
<li>Normal Goal Score - Increase the amount of points for each goal.</li>
<li>Aerial Goal Score - Increase the amount of points for each successful airborne goal.</li>
<li>Assist Score - Players can earn up to three points for each assist.</li>
<li>Enforce Territories: This mutator enables the Split Shot Wall, which dives teams across each half of the field. Those that touch the ground of the opponents' side of the field will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-16-out-now-adds-improved-post-demolition-camera/">demolished</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've ever been in an intense Rocket League match and thought you scored a goal, but you were off by just a hair, a new ping sound will echo throughout the arena. This will happen if the ball hits the crossbar or goal posts to ensure that you don't lose momentum and start celebrating too early.</p>
<p>To make sure that the game is being kept safe for the decent people of Rocket League, player reporting is now being expanded to include voice reporting. This means that as well as being able to block, mute, and report other players, you'll now be able to submit audio evidence if you suspect that they are violating the Community Rules. For those concerned about what that means for them, there is a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/voice-reporting-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed FAQ</a> that explains everything you need to know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the Community Shaders team has released a new major update to the Skyrim graphics framework mod. Following the introduction of features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physically Based Rendering</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skylighting, and dynamic cloud shadows</a>, Community Shaders version <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2.0</a> adds support (through an add-on) for AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, delivering a 60-70% performance uplift for most users. NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, which was implemented a couple of months ago, was also improved, although it remains an older version since the most recent ones do not support DirectX 11. Moreover, neither Multi Frame Generation nor Reflex are currently supported due to issues that NVIDIA should fix on their end. On the other hand, AMD Anti-Lag 2 should be supported.</p>
<p>According to the authors, the Frame Generation feature automatically optimizes Skyrim in a similar way to the extremely popular Display Tweaks mod. Therefore, Display Tweaks is not recommended to be used in conjunction, although it is still supported. The modders also note, as our readers already know very well, that frame Generation works best when your computer can already run the game at around 60 frames per second. The frame rate is then doubled to 120 frames per second, providing reliable frame pacing. Because of this, the feature only enables itself on 120Hz and higher displays, although it can still be forcefully activated from the Community Shaders panel.</p>
<p>The new Community Shaders release also brings several other improvements to Skyrim, such as a new grass shading model and improved grass collision, a parallax shading fix, mipmap LOD bias for TAA/FSR/DLAA to deliver sharper textures, the latest transformer model for DLAA, tweaks to screen space global illumination, brighter skylighting with improved shading, improved wetness effects, and various tonemapping tweaks. There will be several graphics showcases of CS 1.2.0 on YouTube in the next few days, no doubt.</p>
