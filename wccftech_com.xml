			<p>Blizzard has recently filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-wow-2-0-server-will-bring-azeroth-to-unreal-engine-5-with-dlss-and-fsr-support/">Turtle WoW server</a>, highlighting in the suit how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing infringement of the company's intellectual property.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/08/30/blizzard-files-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-against-world-of-warcraft-rogue-server-turtle-wow/">Massively Overpowered</a>, Blizzard finally took action against the rogue World of Warcraft server with a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71235075/1/blizzard-entertainment-inc-v-turtle-wow/">lawsuit</a> that details how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing intellectual property infringement, profiting from the immense popularity of the popular MMORPG using protected vode and game assets.</p>



<p><em>"In the two decades since WoW first was released, Blizzard has invested an enormous amount of time and money into creating, maintaining, and updating the game,"</em> the legal complaint reads. <em>"But when unscrupulous actors such as Defendants seek to profit from Blizzard’s valuable intellectual property (including protected code and game assets) they undermine Blizzard’s own efforts to deliver classic and community-driven content, devalue the WoW experience, and cause serious harm to Blizzard and the many artists, programmers, game designers, and other creative professionals who have worked (and continue to work) tirelessly to create a unique and enjoyable gaming experience for both new and longtime players."</em></p>



<p>Everything considered, it's unlikely that the operators of the Turtle WoW servers will be able to prevent the complete shutdown of the server, all copies of the data from the project, a full account of the money earned by the project and the relinquishing of the domain to Blizzard as the company is demanding in the lawsuit, leaving players with no other choice but to play World of Warcraft classic to enjoy the vanilla WoW experience, although without the custom content the Turtle WoW server offered. The server operators, however, don't want to go down without a fight and have promised on the server's official Discord that Turtle WoW is here to stay and that they are prepared to take on the challenges ahead of them.</p>



<p>Speaking about the modern World of Warcraft experience, the long-running MMORPG will be expanded next year with the Midnight expansion. You can learn more about it in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">interview</a> conducted during last month's Gamescom.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 seems to handle <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-6-rtxdi/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> surprisingly well, delivering a solid experience in docked mode.</p>



<p>Early docked footage of the open-world game released last year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S surfaced online, providing a good look at how the console handles the game in both its linear and open-world segments. While the footage makes it clear plenty of compromises had to be made to get the game running on the new generation Nintendo console, Star Wars Outlaws seems to keep to its 30 FPS cap, resulting in a decent enough performance in docked mode. No handheld footage was shared, however, so it remains to be seen if the system will be able to deliver a decent experience on the go.</p>

<p>In its launch window, the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to receive plenty of third-party ports, and some of them, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077 port</a>, have shown the level of image quality and performance the system can achieve with proper optimization. In the coming months, the next-generation system by Nintendo will receive a few other ports, and some of them are seemingly set to be at the opposite ends of the spectrum, in terms of quality. The Final Fantasy VII Remake Nintendo Switch 2 port will likely be among the best ports, achieving a higher level of quality than the original PlayStation 4 version, which is definitely impressive for a handheld system. On the other hand, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition already doesn't seem to be faring well, possibly due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">CPU limitations</a> and the fact that the game's engine will effectively be its first port for the ARM platform.</p>



<p>Though port quality may differ, the Nintendo Switch 2 offers a lot of improvements over its predecessor. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Skyblivion’s First 15 Minutes Shared in New Video]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyblivion%E2%80%99s-first-15-minutes-shared-in-new-video.1285458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Skyblivion Project Lead Rebelzize has shared the first fifteen minutes of the fan-made Oblivion remake in Skyrim's engine. This is the iconic tutorial section of the game, where the imprisoned main character accompanies Emperor Uriel Septim in his failed bid to escape from the Mythic Dawn's fated assassination. </p>



<p>The video's narrator notes the improved character models, including textures and hair, compared to the original Oblivion. Moreover, when picking ingredients in Skyblivion, they are visually removed in real time. The modding team has remade every armor, weapon, clothing, and miscellaneous item. The lockpicking mixes the original with some elements from the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online. Sound design has been enhanced, too. Weapons will feel more impactful when hitting foes, and there's new ambient music.</p>



<p>The Skyblivion team even worked hard to make the dungeons fit the region they're supposed to be in. For example, in the tutorial dungeon, players will spot the Imperial Isle above and hear local birds chirping through an opening in the ceiling. The remake's loading screens portray new 'interactive layered art,' while a combination of original and updated tooltips offers players guidance to the game's various systems. Both the birth sign user interface and class selection menu have been remade and look much improved over those in the original Oblivion game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This was just a taste of the remake and more will come soon, but the team is also still seeking volunteer help, especially from those users with experience in nav mesh, quest implementation, and UI design. Still, the 2025 release window (<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank">unveiled initi</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/">ally</a> in early 2023) remains the goal, as the modders prepare for one final push.</p>



<p>In other Elder Scrolls modding news, InfernoPlus has somehow <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-morrowind-running-elden-ring-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to port The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to the Elden Ring engine</a>, though the project is far from done.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hollow Knight: Silksong Will Launch at $19.99]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-launch-19-99/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-will-launch-at-19-99.1285449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Adelaide-based independent developer Team Cherry has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:njcr3moahtid7crxdjtu26jp/post/3lxqi3epy3s2p?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the launch pricing of Hollow Knight: Silksong: $19.99/€19.99/¥2300. The studio also shared the unlock time with the fans, confirming that the game will be playable starting Thursday, August 4, at 7 AM Pacific Time | 10 AM Eastern Time | 4 PM Central European Time | 11 PM Japan Time.</p>



<p>It must feel almost unreal to Hollow Knight aficionados. It's been eight and a half years since the first game won widespread critical acclaim and became so popular that it has sold over 15 million units over time. Silksong was announced just two years later and was already playable at E3 2019. Still, for a long while, there were no updates from the team, who would later say they preferred to focus all energies on the development instead of communication. </p>



<p>Originally conceived as a DLC for the first installment, Hollow Knight: Silksong has since become much bigger than its predecessor, boasting more enemies, bosses, and 'benches'. It also features a full-fledged quest system and a journal to track those quests. In the narrative, Hornet, the former princess of Hallownest (the region featured in the first game), is captured and brought to the haunted Kingdom of Pharloom, described as a place "haunted by silk and song." She then embarks on a deadly pilgrimage to ascend its peak and discovers ancient secrets tied to her very nature and past.</p>



<p>The game's release date announcement forced several indie games (CloverPit, Aeterna Lucis, Baby Steps, Demonschool, Faeland, Little Witch in the Woods, and the demo of Stomp and the Sword of Miracles) to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay their own launches</a>, as they feared being overshadowed by the long-anticipated sequel. As a reminder, Hollow Knight: Silksong is being released on PC (Windows, macOS, Linux), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Things to Know Before Starting Hell is Us Guide]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/hell-is-us-guide-5-things-to-know-before-starting/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-things-to-know-before-starting-hell-is-us-guide.1285446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hell is Us is the latest game from Montreal-based studio, Rogue Factor, which has greatly emphasized that this is a game not looking to hold your hand. There are no map markers, no quest trackers, none of the usual open-world comforts modern video game players enjoy.</p>



<p>The game will even remind you of this before it starts, to try and make it land that you're meant to find your way through the game by using your instincts, and paying close attention to your environment. After reviewing it for Wccftech, I can say that Hell is Us does a great job at making that experience feel fun and smooth. I can also say there are a few bits of knowledge that would've been nice to have going into the journey.</p>



<p>That's why this guide will break down the five most important things you'll want to know to be ready to jump into Hell is Us, that also don't ruin the mystery and fun of discovery that's so core to the experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-things-to-know-before-starting-hell-is-us-guide">5 Things to Know Before Starting Hell is Us Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-1-have-a-notebook-and-a-pen-at-the-ready">1. Have a notebook and a pen at the ready</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sometimes it's just easier to write details like this down instead of running back and forth if you can't remember them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You don't need to be writing everything you see and do down, this isn't Blue Prince. But it is helpful to have a notebook beside you with a pen ready to jot down potential clues you come across and parts of a puzzle solution as you try to solve the several puzzles you'll face in Hell is Us. The puzzle gameplay is arguably more important to the game than the combat, and unless you have an incredible memory, or swap back and forth between your game and screenshots you take, you'll need a notebook by your side.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-you-can-t-always-solve-the-puzzle-in-front-of-you-the-first-time-you-see-it">2. You can't always solve the puzzle in front of you the first time you see it</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You won't be able to get into every building and solve every puzzle when you first find them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There will be a few puzzles you come across, one even in the very first area of the game, that you can't solve the first time you see them. You'll need an item or some piece of knowledge that you'll acquire later on in the game, so the only thing to do is to move on and come back to it later.</p>



<p>With Hell is Us lacking any map or quest trackers, it's tough at times to know what will help you progress the main story, what's optional, and what you need to be doing next. All of that packed together means it's easy to spend far too long smashing your head against something you literally cannot solve the first or sometimes even the second time you come across it. Again, another reason why it's good to have a notebook with you, so you can make a note remembering to go back when you have the item or knowledge you're missing.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-spec-into-crowd-control">3. Spec into crowd-control</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Combat encounters are often 3-or-more-against-1. Image credit: Rogue Factor</figcaption></figure>



<p>You have a few different weapon varieties you can choose from, and between those varieties, you can tweak them by infusing abilities based on four core emotions that are central to the game's story. It all comes down to what you prefer to use, because I found that there are things to appreciate with weapon variants for each emotion. But succeeding in the combat is less about the specifics of your gear, and more about how the weapons and abilities you select let you control the flow of combat.</p>



<p>Hell is Us doesn't feature a lot of boss fights; more accurately, it features several combat encounters with a few or sometimes large quantities of enemies that are designed to try and catch you off-balance. That's why whatever weapon you choose, whatever emotional variant you infuse it with, you'll want abilities and a weapon that can help you even out the odds.</p>



<p>A larger weapon, like a greatsword or the halbred-esque polearm are helpful physical tools for crowd control, but area-of-effect abilities that can be added to any of your weapons are going to be more important in helping you keep the advantage in a fight. So even if you go with the shorter-ranged twin axes, as I did for a good chunk of my playthrough, having abilities that stunned and damaged enemies within a certain area of impact helped even out the fact that I could only really focus my blows at one creature at a time, instead of taking wide sweeping attacks against a group.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-talk-to-everyone">4. Talk to everyone</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Details on where to go and what to do next will commonly come up in conversations you have.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This one should be a little more obvious due to how puzzle solving works in Hell is Us, but it needs to be said: talk to every NPC you see. If you can ask them questions, ask them as many questions as you can. Even the six general knowledge topics you'll see appear with every NPC you can have a direct conversation with.</p>



<p>Most of the time, answers pertaining to your investigation and the puzzle you're trying to solve will come through the unique questions you can ask for each NPC. But there are answers to be found when asking the general knowledge questions.</p>



<p>Even beyond just asking to try and help solve a gameplay-related issue you have, it's worth talking to them because Rogue Factor has done a wonderful job in making everyone you meet feel like a real person. Half of the enjoyment there is in Hell is Us comes from the strength of its supporting cast. Spend as much time with them as you can.</p>



<p>Also, you'll have objects you can 'Trade' with NPCs, which is to say there are things you'll find in the world that, if you listen carefully, are items you can deliver to NPCs who have indirectly asked for them. If you're not sure if you've matched the right object to the person, there's no harm in asking, since the wrong person will just tell you they don't need the object or whatever it is you're offering.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-keep-your-head-on-a-swivel">5. Keep your head on a swivel</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You'll always want to be looking at what's on the walls.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hell is Us is not an open-world game. There are several places you'll go to in the game's setting throughout the story, and each is a contained zone that you can explore to the extent of its boundaries.</p>



<p>Because there's no active map for you to rely on, nothing that will tell you in real-time where you've gone and where you're going, you'll need to learn how to get around each zone. Sure, you can make notes and jot directions for yourself, but it's worth keeping in mind that each zone has been designed with the intention that you should be able to find your way naturally.</p>



<p>On top of paying attention to everything people tell you and making notes of the clues you'll read or pick up, looking at the details of your environment is vital to figuring out where to go next and how to solve the puzzles you'll come across. Keep your head on a swivel and don't stop looking around until you're sure you have all the information you need as you move from room to room and place to place within each zone. Since they're all contained, you don't have to worry as much about getting lost and winding up somewhere too far from where you want to be, like how taking the wrong path in an open-world game can mean an hour of backtracking if you're not paying attention.</p>
