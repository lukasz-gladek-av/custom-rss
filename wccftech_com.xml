			<p>A Dragon Quest VII remake is reportedly in the works and will make its debut either next year or in early 2027, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>A new report posted by MP1st a few days back revealed that a remake of the seventh main entry in the series is currently in the works and is planned to launch before March 2027. The information comes from internal documents outlining several upcoming projects related to the publisher's top franchises, reportedly all scheduled for release in the current fiscal year ending in March 2026 or early the next. The project scope is unclear, but the publisher usually uses the term HD Remake for remasters, so the fact that this project is labeled as a remake suggests that its scope could be bigger than the series' HD-2D Remakes we have seen so far. Even so, it shouldn't be expected to be in line with that of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, judging from some<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mp1st-square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-planned-for-release-in-2026.1242312/post-142607172"> information </a>provided by the ever-reliable Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>Even if the Dragon Quest VII remake ends up being based on the 3DS remake released a while back, it would still be a game worth playing for fans of the series who never experienced the original PlayStation 1 release and even for those who did, as the remake introduces a lot of improvements that the experience much more enjoyable. Those interested in playing the game, however, would need to set aside a lot of their free time, as Dragon Quest VII is among the longest entries in the series, as a regular playthrough can take well over 80 hours.</p>



<p>Although the Dragon Quest VII remake has yet to be announced, fans of the series still have something to look forward to this year, as the Dragon Quest 1 &amp; II HD-2D remake will launch this <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-is-out-on-october-30-switch-2-version-added/">October</a> worldwide.</p>

			<p>A new Wilds Hearts S comparison shared online during the weekend highlights how the Nintendo Switch 2 can hold its own with other current-generation systems, and in some cases, even surpassing them.</p>



<p>The new comparison shared on YouTube by Cycu1 is based on the recently released playable demo, putting the Nintendo Switch 2 release side by side with every other console version, doing an excellent job highlighting the differences between the different versions. While the Switch 2 version of the game loses to the others in terms of geometry and the details of the environment, it looks surprisingly pleasant, especially as the haze that surrounds all of the game's environments has been toned down considerably, resulting in a sharper image despite the evident lower resolution. In some other instances, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game clearly surpasses the Xbox Series S version of the game, sporting higher-quality resolution textures, highlighting once again how important it is to have more available RAM. Wild Hearts S also runs at a higher framerate than the Xbox Series S version, targeting 60 FPS, as opposed to the 30 FPS targeted on Microsoft's sytstem</p>

<p>It's great to see how Nintendo Switch 2 owners won't have to make do with a several cut-down version of Wild Hearts, as the game developed by Omega Force is one worth experiencing for fans of Monster Hunter and similar games. You can learn more about what makes the game so engaging, and the performance issues that impacted the experience at launch on PC and, to en extent, on PlayStation 5, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/">review.</a></p>



<p>Wild Hearts S launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 25 worldwide.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto IV with the iCEnhancer 4.0 mod is the remaster that Rockstar Games still doesn't seem interested in releasing, introducing plenty of improvements that enhance the game's visuals considerably.</p>



<p>The release of the new version of a classic mod for the fourth entry in the series, which has been in the works for quite some time, has been announced with a new trailer which highlights the improvements it brings, including new physically-based lighting, new shaders that bring better fog rendering and water and more. As of now, the mod only works with version 1.0.3.0 and 1.0.4.0 of the game, as they are the ones that work best with ENB, so make sure to have either version installed before downloading the mod from its <a href="https://icelaglace.com/mods/ice4.html">official website.</a></p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto IV has originally been released back in 2008, and it is the only 3D entry in the series that is not natively playable on current-generation systems, although Xbox Series X and S owners can play the original Xbox 360 release via backward compatibility. An official remaster has been rumored to be in the works for a while, but it has never materialized, nor has any straightforward port, although one is rumored to have been in the works for a year and may be released <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-iv-port-current-generation-max-payne-3/">before the end of the year</a>. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Grand Theft Auto VI slipping to May 2026</a>, the port releasing before the end of 2025 would make a lot of sense, so hopefully, the rumors are true, and the fourth entry in the series will indeed make its return to current generation systems to make the wait for the next entry in the series much more bearable.</p>

			<p>The prices for the two ROG Xbox Ally models have leaked online, and they are surprisingly reasonable, considering what they offer.</p>



<p>As spotted by Spanish publication 3D Juegos, ASUS itself leaked the price of the two systems for Europe. The cheaper model will cost €599, around $650, while the premium, more powerful X model will cost €899, around $975. While these prices may look steep for the average user, they are in line with the other handheld PCs on the market and are in the ballpark of the price most expected. </p>



<p>The ROG Xbox Ally systems were rumored to be in the works for some time, and have been officially announced last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, delivering higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither of the two models will come with an<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/">&nbsp;OLED display</a>, which was ruled out by the necessity of having VRR support and balancing power draw and costs.</p>



<p>As of now, we do not know when the two ROG Xbox Ally models will launch worldwide. Earlier rumors suggested the handheld systems will launch sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-launching-october-price/">October,</a> and with the prices leaking online, there's a good chance ASUS and Microsoft are gearing up for an official price and release date announcement.</p>
