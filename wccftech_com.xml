			<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-full-launch-scheduled-for-may-21-devs-want-to-bring-the-entirety-of-westeros-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, Netmarble has released Game of Thrones: Kingsroad on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-e19c7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and Windows Launcher) and mobile devices (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>) across the world with the exception of Asia, where the game will debut later in 2025. The action/adventure roleplaying game (powered by Unreal Engine 5) had previously debuted in early access exclusively on PC. Cross-play is enabled between PC and mobile, by the way, once you've linked the accounts.</p>
<p>The launch update added the new Stormlands region, the one ruled by Stannis Baratheon. Players will find new story missions and side content, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ferocious Beast</li>
<li>Bandit Camps</li>
<li>Echoes of the Past</li>
<li>Historic Sites</li>
<li>Occupied Sites</li>
<li>Gods Haven</li>
</ul>
<p>The level cap was raised from 40 to 45. Four new Artifacts (one Legendary, one Epic, and two Uncommon) have been added. New Achievements have been added for performing feats in the Stormlands as well as defeating the Unicorn and Drogon. Moreover, an emote system was added to Game of Thrones: Kingsroad and can now be accessed by selecting the emotes icon in the lower right corner of the chat window.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uNd9WH5QmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To celebrate the official launch, Netmarble will gift players a random reward once per day through June 5. Potential rewards include x80 Golden Dragon, x1 Ruin Runner, x2,000 Copper, x10 Iron Ore, x1 Artifact Expedition Requisition, x3 Silver Ore, and x1 Enraging Draught Bundle. To claim the rewards, players must simply visit the Web Shop daily.</p>
<p>Over time, the developer has expressed the desire to add all the remaining regions to eventually bring all of Westeros to life. Of course, being a live service game at its core, it will largely depend on the game's success. If Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is popular enough, it may happen over time; otherwise, it could be shut down way before that happens.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment.1195950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-rebrands-to-fellowship-entertainment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Embracer Group announced a rebranding to Fellowship Entertainment.&nbsp;<span>This is a clear nod to The Lord of the Rings IP, whose rights Embracer&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rights-embracer-low-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purchased</a> around two years ago&nbsp;</span>for a relatively low sum ($395 million). Following the acquisition, COO Matthew Karch <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-needs-to-be-turned-into-one-of-gamings-biggest-franchises-says-embracer-coo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that the group's priority should be turning The Lord of the Rings into one of gaming's biggest franchises. Karch is no longer with Embracer (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">split with Saber Interactive a while ago</a>), but the sentiment appears to have remained the same, given the brand name's choice.</p>
<p>Of course, Tolkien's beloved fantasy universe is just one of many big franchises owned by Fellowship Entertainment, such as Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Killing Floor, Darksiders, Remnant, and Tomb Raider. The new company will house over 6K employees spread across 50 companies or so.</p>
<p>The other big news announced today is that Coffee Stain Group (Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Deep Rock Galactic) is being spun off into a separately listed company. Lars Wingefors, co-founder and Group CEO of Embracer, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Coffee Stain Group has incredible talent, IPs and communities. To date, it has been a true recipe for success. I am confident in Anton's strategy and leadership and see a clear long-term opportunity in attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents.</em></p>
<p>Anton Westbergh, co-founder and Group CEO of Coffee Stain, added:</p>
<p><em>We’re really proud of everything we’ve built as part of Embracer, and grateful for the support and trust we’ve received over the years. Now, as we take the step to become a separately listed company, it feels both exciting and, honestly, a little bit scary—but in a good way.</em></p>
<p><em>The games industry is more competitive than ever, but also more rewarding if you do things right, and we believe this move gives us the clarity and control to navigate the landscape better on our own terms. We can now focus even more on what we do best—supporting our developers, staying close to our communities, and building an even brighter future for Coffee Stain.</em></p>
<p>The Embracer name will live on, albeit stained after countless <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-interactive-suffers-embracers-restructuring-codemasters-also-hit-by-layoffs-at-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closures</a>, only as the privately held holding company of Fellowship Entertainment, Coffee Stain Group, and Asmodee Group (which had been spun off earlier this year). Lars Wingefors, as the main shareholder, will remain in control.</p>
<p>The company also provided an overview of its announced release schedule. In fiscal year 2025/2026, the following titles will be launched:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Eden</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gothic 1 Remake</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REANIMAL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fellowship</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wreckreation</a></li>
<li>The next SpongeBob SquarePants game</li>
<li>NORSE: Oath of Blood</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core-is-a-roguelite-spin-off-of-the-popular-co-op-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killing Floor 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-and-skydance-games-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Embracer said a triple-A game previously scheduled for 2025/2026 is likely to be moved to 2026/2027. The company expects <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar sales to Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> for this title. They may be referring to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-metro-game-will-be-much-darker-due-to-the-war-says-4a-games-will-be-ready-when-its-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next Metro game</a>, though there's no way to know for sure.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/blades-of-fire-5-things-to-know-to-enjoy-the-game-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blades-of-fire-%E2%80%93-5-things-to-know-to-enjoy-the-game-more.1195914/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/blades-of-fire-5-things-to-know-to-enjoy-the-game-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although Blades of Fire is not that different from other action-adventure games like the modern God of War games and challenging action role-playing games in the vein of FromSoftware's Souls series, playing the game developed by MercurySteam the same way as these games will result in a frustrating experience. As such, learning some of the gameplay systems' intricacies will go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>As you are starting out your quest to kill the Queen, however, you won't get many opportunities to delve deeper into some of the game's unique mechanics. Still, there are a few things to know right at the start of the adventure that can make Blades of Fire way more enjoyable.</p>
<h2>Manage your Weapons wisely</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.54.15.59-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the game, your weapon selection will be limited, and you may end up relying on a single weapon that seems to be doing well. What you should be doing, however, is start getting used to the game's weapon mechanics, as you will soon encounter an enemy that your favorite weapon may not be able to damage. As such, you should have on hand multiple weapons that allow you to deal blunt, slashing, and piercing damage. While penetration values may not be too important at the start, you should always make sure they are as high as possible, so bringing multiple weapons that deal the same type of damage may be beneficial in the end, as it will make sure the penetration value of any specific weapon doesn't get too low to the point that you will need to sharpen your weapon, reducing durability.</p>
<h2>Make Use of Your Broken Weapons</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.55.19.67-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter how good you are at weapon management in Blades of Fire, there will come a time when a weapon breaks and cannot be repaired. In the first few hours of the game, your only option will be to recycle the weapon to get back some of the materials you used to forge it, but as soon as you meet Glinda, you will have another option to use your broken weapons to get items. After meeting the character, you will unlock the Reputation system, which makes weapons become more valuable the more enemies they kill. Weapons with high enough reputation can be offered to Glinda to obtain a lot of units of any material at once, which is a big help later in the game when the rarest Steel requires a lot of materials. As such, if you need a lot of a specific material, the better option is to offer a broken weapon to Glinda. Otherwise, recycling could be the way to go if you need multiple materials.</p>
<h2>Always finish your enemies with Heavy Attacks</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.45.56.14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides unleashing light attacks, Aran can perform powerful heavier attacks by holding down any of the four attack buttons. While these attacks are slower than the regular light attacks, they are considerably more powerful and can dismember enemies if they deplete their HP bar. This is extremely important to keep in mind against bosses with multiple health bars, as it is possible to temporarily disable some of their abilities by using heavy attacks when they are stunned, but it's something to keep in mind for regular enemies as well. Finishing enemies with a heavy attack makes the weapon earn increased Reputation, which is something you should always do to obtain large quantities of materials as outlined above. Durability heavily decreases with these attacks, however, so you should always strive to hit a balance to avoid finding yourself without any usable weapon at hand.</p>
<h2>Learn the Forging Mechanics</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.52.31.28-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The weapon forging mechanics in Blades of Fire are extremely important, and fully understanding them can really make a difference, no matter where you are in the game. While picking the right Steel or Wood is a straightforward process, as the game highlights how much the weapon changes depending on your selection, the actual forging of the weapons is not as simple. As a general rule, you want to be able to repair your weapons as much as possible, so you should be striving for the highest possible quality at all times. Resources are limited, and can take a while to farm, so you want a weapon forged with the best possible Steel to last you as long as possible.</p>
<h2>Don't be Afraid to Lower the Difficulty</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.55.34.80-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As I highlighted in my review, Blades of Fire's level design gets complex very easily, and with so many multiple paths and shortcuts, it is very easy to get lost. There's a way, however, to highlight where to go for the next story objective in the main options menu, but only if you are playing the game at the Iron or Bronze difficulties. Still, you can use this waypoint system even in Steel difficulty by lowering the difficulty, selecting the Show Objective option, and increasing it again. You will not earn a specific achievement by doing this, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff for a first playthrough, in my opinion, as exploration can really get frustrating without proper guidance, especially at the start of the adventure.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studio%E2%80%99s-issues-%E2%80%9Ceverything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed%E2%80%9D.1195737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Bungie developers are speaking out about the problems Bungie is facing internally, and all signs point to leadership and structural issues following Sony's acquisition of Bungie, and a human resources department, or at least, a single member of that department, covering up internal issues of harassment for personal gain on their exit from the studio.</p>
<p>Internal issues at Bungie, unfortunately, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/">aren't anything new</a>, but this latest slew of details comes from Destin Legarie, who published a video on his YouTube channel after speaking to former Bungie developers. Many of the comments are quite damning, and paint the picture of a Bungie that is not the same studio it once was when every first-person shooter fan on the planet couldn't wait to see what they would do next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Inside Bungie’s Decline: Former Devs Speak Out" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No direct names were mentioned in the video as to who the former Bungie employees were calling out, everything was kept in more general terms with just the word 'leadership' being used to represent Bungie's top brass.</p>
<p>All of this came about after Bungie was caught using artwork and/or art assets from another artist without their permission or crediting them for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">the fourth time in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed</em>," a former Bungie developer told Legarie. Another quote went further, saying "<em>Bungie's problem stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture.</em>"</p>
<p>Another quote reads "<em>Internal language shifted from 'studio,' 'games,' and 'players,' to 'company,' 'product,' and 'customers,' during the Sony acquisition,</em>" highlighting how the studio has seemingly shifted its viewpoint that making good games for players to enjoy is no longer the ultimate goal, and is instead making games that make <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/21/more-bungie-reveals-from-destiny-2-subscriptions-to-eververse-demands/">as much money as possible</a>.</p>
<p>There have been negative stories about internal problems at the Destiny 2 developer for the past couple of years, and morale certainly can't be helped by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">layoffs the studio has suffered</a>. All of leadership might be part of the problem, which is what seems to be the speculation in this video, but as Legarie points out, the buck has to stop somewhere, and in the case of Bungie, that's with chief executive officer Pete Parsons.</p>
<p>It's extremely unfortunate that the studio behind Halo and Destiny, two of the biggest shooter franchises in video game history, is facing all of this, and could see its end due to its allegedly greedy and inconsiderate leaders who have lost the plot, and the fact that if not for the studio making games that people wanted to play in the first place, none of them would be where they are.</p>

			<p>Ara: History Untold's upcoming DLC, Untold Scenarios, will arrive on PC this coming June 18, 2025, developer Oxide Games has announced.</p>
<p>The expansion will be available for $9.99 USD, and will include several scenarios that blend historical events with alternative history to create 'what-if' scenarios for "<em>more event-driven strategic challenges</em>," according to a press release for the upcoming expansion.</p>
<p>While Ara: History Untold is playable through Xbox Game Pass PC, that's only for the base game. If you want to play any of these new scenarios, you'll need to grab the DLC on its own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ara: History Untold | Dev Q&amp;A | Ep. 9" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCsXUG3ZsyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ara: History Untold arrived on PC and through Game Pass PC last September, and overall arrived as "<em>a mixed bag,"&nbsp;</em>according to our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/">reviewer, Chris Wray</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Ara: History Untold is the perfect example of a mixed bag. Some genuinely great ideas, but some negatives are trying to counterbalance them. Focusing on supply chains and adding real to is an excellent idea, but the implementation has left the game with significant micromanagement, which could put people off. The region and city development systems are on a whole new level and could be how 4X games go in the future, but the AI manages to mess it</em> up," he wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Ara: History Untold is a highly ambitious 4X game that looks to branch out and add even more depth to an already detailed genre. In many ways, it succeeds, bringing in a map and city-building system that far surpasses others in the genre and successfully interlinking practically every area. However, with some successes come issues, with the added depth in the supply chain making it a bit of a micromanagement nightmare; it tries to alleviate some of these issues with a user-friendly UI, but it could be a sticking point for some.</em>"</p>
