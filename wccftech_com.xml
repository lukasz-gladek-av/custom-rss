			<p>Exactly three months ago, Overwatch 2 Game Director Aaron Keller <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-is-exploring-how-to-test-6v6-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began</a> the discussion between the development team and the community on how to bring back the 6v6 mode that was initially removed in the sequel. A few hours ago, Keller <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an update and shared concrete details on when and how 6v6 tests will happen.</p>
<p>There will be two tests in Season 14. The first one will begin a week after the season's debut and will feature a variation of Open Queue. Each team of 6 must have at least one hero of each role and no more than three. According to Keller, this opens up a lot of different team compositions that players haven't seen before in Overwatch 2. Roles can be switched during a match, as long as it doesn't break the 'min 1, max 3' limit. This test also aims to give Blizzard a look at how Overwatch 2's heroes, abilities, and updates work in a 6v6 environment.</p>
<p>The second 6v6 test will take place later, during Season 14's mid-cycle, and it will feature the classic 2-2-2 matchup with some twists (such as less CC and hero rework). Both 6v6 Tests will have their own map in Unranked alongside other modes and will not replace other types of game modes such as Seasonal Events or Quick Play: Hacked. Blizzard will also introduce several balance changes that will only apply to these two test modes: for example, tank power and survivability will be reduced in these 6v6 formats, and the studio will evaluate whether they need many of the passive abilities that were added in Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Season 13, Blizzard will also experiment with two 5v5 formats. In the first one, called Limit 2, the maximum number of each role will be limited to two. This includes Tanks, but they will be tuned to Open Queue balance, so they will have less health. The second format is being dubbed Kingmaker; here, the maximum number of each role is still limited to two - however, the player alone in their role gets some kind of bonus.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his article, Keller also hints Blizzard now sees a world where 5v5 and 6v6 are both available on a permanent basis in Overwatch 2. Of course, it will depend on how these tests are received. Whether that will be enough to inject some much-needed lifeblood into the game remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, during the Indie Horror Showcase hosted by DreadXP, Nightdive Studios released a new gameplay trailer for The Thing Remastered. The new trailer provides a detailed look at the bloody and mangled events inside Outpost #31 and the crew's desperation as they attempt to escape from a gruesome, corporeal alien menace.</p>
<p>The Thing Remastered is a remaster of 2002's squad-based third-person shooter horror game. Originally developed by Computer Artworks, it was obviously based on John Carpenter's seminal horror movie, released in 1982. Nightdive Studios, which specializes in remasters and remakes (<a href="https://wccftech.com/quake-ii-remaster-announced-quake-ii-64-new-expansion-machingames/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quake II</a>, DOOM and DOOM II, System Shock, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-turok-2-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok</a>, Blade Runner, and Star Wars: Dark Forces just to name a few), has ported the old game to its proprietary KEX engine. This enabled a series of improvements: 4K resolution and up to 120 frames per second support, not to mention enhancements to character models, textures, animations, lighting, and atmospheric effects. Nightdive has also added brand new Trophies and Achievements on all platforms.</p>
<p>The Thing Remastered is slated to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. For more info on the remaster, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-xsufeLmxk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nightdive's Deep Dive podcast</a>.</p>

<p><em>You are Cpt J.F. Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate the blood-curdling events and enigmatic deaths of the American scientific team that transpired at the Outpost 31 research facility located in the frozen wastelands of Antarctica. Within these inhospitable surroundings your team encounters a strange shape-shifting alien life-form that assumes the appearance of people that it kills. Trapped by the elements and infected by this horrific entity, using all your team members is critical if you hope to accomplish your objectives, let alone survive.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In 20 frightening levels, lead your team against terrifying monsters, from the scuttling head-spiders and human-like walkers to gigantic multi-tentacled beasts.</em></li>
<li><em>Advanced trust/fear interface adds a new level of interaction â€“ How you influence your team's psychological state determines whether or not they will co-operate with you.</em></li>
<li><em>Use awesome firepower like machine guns, explosives, and flamethrowers to torch your enemies.</em></li>
<li><em>Choose multiple paths to solve problems that lie ahead and accomplish goals</em></li>

			<p>It has been a long-term concern by fans of the first game that Beyond Good and Evil 2 was no longer in the works. However, it was recently confirmed that it is, and now we've received news via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fawzi-mesmar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> that Fawzi Mesmar is joining the team as Creative Director. This was announced publicly on LinkedIn, with Mesmar announcing his new role at Ubisoft Montpellier, after previously working as Vice President of Editorial over at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Emile Morel was the previous Creative Director for the title but unfortunately passed away suddenly last year. This led to Mesmar filling the role. This industry veteran has over 20 years of experience in the industry, working for companies such as DICE, King, and Gameloft. He additionally won an Ambassador Award at the 2024 Game Developer's Choice Awards.</p>
<p>For many, this news comes as a shock, as Beyond Good and Evil 2 was first announced in 2008, with a trailer being released during Ubisoft's 2017 E3 conference, and there has been very minimal information about the sequel since then. The original director Michel Ancel even left Ubisoft in 2020, and now works in a wildlife sanctuary instead. However, he is now consulting on a new Rayman project.</p>
<p>While there hasn't been any news on Beyond Good and Evil 2, a 4K remake of the original was released earlier this year. However, this meant that the original version of the game was removed, and people were forced to buy the 20th Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>With Beyond Good and Evil 2 still reportedly being in development, this now makes it the longest development time for a AAA game, with Duke Nukem Forever's record being fifteen years. It's said that development has taken so long due to toxic leadership, chaotic direction and constant gridlock when it came to making decisions about how the game was going to look, and what features would be in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to Fawzi Mesmar joining the team, Francide Coldeboeuf is now taking over as Producer on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">struggles Ubisoft</a> has been dealing with their other projects, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/"> XDefiant</a> not performing to their expectations, it's quite a surprise that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development all these years later.</p>
<p>However, the title has reportedly passed an internal milestone with positive feedback from the leadership, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Kotaku</a>. Whether that means that the game is actually progressing nicely is uncertain, and it's anyone's guess as to when the audience will finally see this game come to fruition.</p>
