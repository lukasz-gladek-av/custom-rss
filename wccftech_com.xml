			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-spotted-in-new-datamine/">Insider-Gaming</a>, a datamined leak points to EA hosting an open beta for its next entry in the Battlefield series, which we only know as Battlefield 6 for now, since its official title has yet to be revealed. </p>



<p>While datamining Battlefield Labs, the program through which EA is testing new features for the next Battlefield game and consistently playtesting the new entry, the datamining group 1BF Telegram Group found "<em>Battlefield 6 Open Beta</em>" added in the most recent update, though no further details came with the phrase. </p>



<p>It's not the biggest shock that EA would plan an open beta for its next major shooter, since that's the common pattern for how multiplayer-focused games are launched. The beta not only gives the developers a chance to stress-test the servers, it gives players a chance to get a feel for the game ahead of its proper launch. </p>



<p>We've seen a number of leaks for Battlefield 6, including videos of the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/">Rush Mode</a>, and footage of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/">campaign</a>, and EA has even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">officially shared clips</a> from the Battlefield Labs playtests to show how development is progressing. </p>



<p>A full, proper reveal for the game is all we're missing at this point, which, according to EA, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">due to arrive sometime this summer</a>. It could be that alongside the full reveal, EA will announce the open beta and the dates it'll be live, but for now, we'll have to wait and see. </p>



<p>When the reveal does happen, hopefully, it goes well, as EA reportedly has extremely high expectations for this new shooter. A recent report pointed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">EA executives setting a target of 100 million players</a>. It also claimed that the budget for this new game has hit an eye-watering $400 million, which at least partly explains why EA executives are hoping the game can reach such high player numbers. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a year and a half since we <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard from BioShock creator Ken Levine</a>. As you're probably aware, ever since disbanding Irrational Games, he has founded a smaller studio called Ghost Story Games. For the last eight years or so, they have worked on a game that we now know to be titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-announcement-trailer-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judas</a>, a game that is based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ken-levines-new-game-is-small-scale-open-world-sci-fiai-themed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levine's concept of 'narrative LEGOs'</a> to be endlessly replayable, at least in theory.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the BioShock creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzERtlBcB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a video interview with Lawrence Sonntag from Nightdive Studios</a>. In the hour-long conversation, Levine promised that Judas would be an old-school single player games and expressed gratitude to parent company Take-Two Interactive that they weren't forced to add any live service elements with additional monetization like microtransactions.</p>



<p><em>I grew up playing single player games, and I grew up before certain types of monetization existed. And again, I'm not here at all to say this is bad or this is good, right? That's not really my thing. I know the kind of games I like to make. Judas is a very old-school game. Like, you buy the game and get the whole thing. There's no live service, because everything that we do is in service of telling the story and transporting the player somewhere. This is no diss on any developers who've done that, because look, games are expensive to make, and we're very fortunate that we work at a company where they believe at least in us enough where they will say okay, you're going to work on this thing for a long time, and it's going to cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not going to push any of that stuff on you.<br></em></p>



<p><em>But I understand why it happens, right? And I don't blame anybody for trying to make a living, but I like making the games I want to play, and the kind of games I want to play are I just want to have an experience with a game and have that game be just that. All it wants to do is entertain me, right? It's got no other ulterior motives and Judas and our games have not had ulterior motives. And I'm lucky that we've been able to do that. It's a difficult time in the industry, as you know, and not everybody is as lucky as we are that we get to make a game that can really just pursue the player's joy. I think unwisely the industry has decided that you need all these elements, but if you look at the games that have really landed in the past couple of years, they are the games providing this, whether it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> or The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. These are really traditional single player games and they don't have that kind of monetization in them, and I think the audience has rewarded those games, especially in the AAA space, because it gets so expensive that people want other methods of monetization. I'm just grateful that we're allowed to not have to do that because that just frees us to purely design the game for the player's experience.</em></p>



<p>Understandably, the Ken Levine creator does not really reveal any significant new details about his next game, Judas, which remains without a release window. That said, for all we know, it could change either at Gamescom or at The Game Awards. Here's hoping anyway, as the actual new BioShock installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still seems far from launching</a>.</p>
