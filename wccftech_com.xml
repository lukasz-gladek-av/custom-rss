			<p>As we predicted when <strong>Sony</strong> announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/"><strong>State of Play</strong>,</a> one of the <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong> reveals for tonight's showcase was the gameplay and release date reveal for <strong>Ghost of Yotei Legends</strong>, after it was initially announced during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/">Gamescom 2025</a>.</strong> Just like <strong>Ghost of Tsushima Legends</strong>, this new co-op multiplayer mode will be available as free DLC for players who already own Ghost of Yotei, and it'll arrive on <strong>March 10, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Showcased with gameplay captured on a <strong>PS5 Pro</strong>, the new trailer showed a bit of the kinds of missions you'll get to play in Ghost of Yotei Legends, which are Survival, Story, and Raid. You're back as playing through one of four classes: a Samurai, an Archer, a Mercenary, or a Shinobi.</p>



<p>The Survival mode will see you team up with three other players to take down waves of enemies while fighting for territory control. The Story will see you complete a series of 12 missions, each of which ending with a boss fight against a twisted version of one of the Yotei Six: <strong>the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune,</strong> and <strong>the Snake.</strong></p>

<p>"<em>The fan response to Legends was one of the most rewarding parts of launching Ghost of Tsushima, and we’re so excited to see the mode return for Ghost of Yōtei; we can’t for you all to dive in</em>," added Sucker Punch's senior communications manager, <strong>Andrew Goldfarb</strong>, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/ghost-of-yotei-legends-comes-to-ps5-on-march-10/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that went live shortly after the trailer.</p>

<p>With the game's high-quality world design, <strong>ultrawide support</strong> in particular is sure to make Death Stranding 2: On The Beach on PC even <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more immersive</strong>.<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore,"</em> wrote Kai Tatsumoto in our <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">review</strong> of the PlayStation 5 release. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online."</em></p>
