			<p>Valve's Half-Life 2 has just reached its 20th anniversary (we muse on its significance and that of other games released in that incredible month <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaming-greatest-month-20-year-later-remembering-november-2004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). To celebrate the achievement, the developer is giving away free copies of the title (along with Episodes One and Two) until later today. You can get the game and its expansions by visiting the respective page on Steam, which can be done via the link <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Valve has also uploaded a 20th anniversary documentary, which reveals many interesting tidbits about the game's making. Perhaps even more interesting, though, is Gabe Newell's explanation of why Half-Life 2 Episode Three was never released.</p>
<p><em>You can't get lazy and say, oh, we're moving the story forward. That's copping out of your obligation to gamers. Of course they love the story. They love many aspects of it, but saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next... You know, we could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why doing Half-Life 2 Episode Three was pushing anything forward.</em></p>
<p><em>I think that Half-Life represents a tool we have and promises made to customers to capitalize on innovation and opportunities to build game experiences that haven't been involved previously, and I think that there are no shortages of those opportunities facing us as an industry.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, Valve pushed out a minor title update for Half-Life 2. The patch mainly focuses on quality improvements, along with subtle graphical changes. Here's the complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed pops, holes in the world, fading-out and disappearing objects across the game.</em></li>
<li><em>Rebalanced the lighting across Half-Life 2 to account for playing with HDR on or off, using the original release as reference.</em></li>
<li><em>Cleaner, smoother horizon lines thanks to new radial fog!</em></li>
<li><em>Added higher-resolution lightmaps across the game!</em></li>
<li><em>Removed green glow from the G-Man model’s eyes in the opening of the game, and restored the reflective glint as seen in the original release.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed missing grass sprites and blacked-out models throughout the game!</em></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Updated Graphics Settings</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Choose either the original launch day blood and fire effects, or those created for the episodes, when playing the Half-Life 2 base game!</em></li>
<li><em>Play with only the highest detail models in High Quality mode!</em></li>
<li><em>Get smoother lightmap shadows at Very High shader detail, thanks to new bicubic lightmap filtering!</em></li>
</ul>
<section id="deck">
<h3><em>Gamepad, Input, and Steam Deck Updates</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Gamepad controls have been updated to match the Half-Life 1 anniversary update.</em></li>
<li><em>Aim Assistance has gotten an overhaul making it feel better to use, and there are more configuration options available. Aim Assistance can be enabled separately for gamepad or mouse/keyboard input. The amount of assistance can be tuned up and down, and it’s no longer tied to a skill setting. Want to play on Hard with high aim assist, or Easy with it off? Knock yourself out.</em></li>
<li><em>The Steam Deck main menu has been updated with all of today’s additions including the Episodes, Workshop, and new input configuration. The Steam Deck version of the main menu will also appear when you play Half-Life 2 on a PC running Big Picture Mode.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA is also celebrating the Half-Life 2 20th anniversary" by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-half-life-2-themed-rtx-4080-super-giveaway-celebrate-20th-game-anniversary/">announcing a "Half-Life 2-themed" GPU giveaway</a> for the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER. As a reminder, Orbifold Studios is currently making an RTX Remix <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-gets-stunning-new-video-to-celebrate-the-games-20th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remaster</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gaming-greatest-month-20-year-later-remembering-november-2004/</link>

			<p>Gaming has had many great periods over its fifty-four years of history (Computer Space, the first commercial game, was developed in 1970 and released the following year), and fans often have hot debates about the best year for new game releases. Today, however, I wanted to place the spotlight on what I consider to be, without a shred of doubt, the best month ever for gaming: November 2004.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, eight seminal games were released in twenty-eight days, breaking people's wallets but also forever marking the spot (and, in some cases, outright changing it) in the history of this entertainment medium. In this article, I'll explain why they were (and in many ways still are) so important while also remembering my feelings about them at the time. The list is strictly ordered based on their respective release dates.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/gta-sa-logo-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - October 26, 2004</h2>
<p>Rockstar's fifth main entry in the GTA series technically launched a few days before November, but it still fits the twenty-eight-day timeframe between it and the final game on this list. Moreover, I could never leave it out over something so trivial. While the previous installments in the franchise were already highly popular, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas reached an entirely new dimension when it dropped into the gaming market. The game outsold Vice City by 45% in its first week, selling 4.5 million units.</p>
<p>It would become the best-selling game in a crowded year, thanks to universal critical acclaim (95/100 on Metacritic) and some good old-fashioned mainstream controversy due to the infamous Hot Coffee minigame. The acclaim and sales were well-earned, as San Andreas improved over Vice City in every area: gameplay, visuals, world size, features, etc., setting a new standard for open-world titles.</p>
<p>As for my take at the time, I wasn't the biggest GTA fan back then, so it wasn't my most anticipated title. Perhaps it's because the previous title featured highly repetitive missions and merely passable plots, but San Andreas was the game that leveled up both areas, allowing Rockstar to sit on the open world games throne for a long time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1494924-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Counter-Strike: Source - November 1, 2004</h2>
<p>The only remake on this list, Counter-Strike: Source brought the popular competitive first-person shooter game to modern technology. It was the first game to launch on the market with Valve's new Source engine, and the studio (which was helped by Turtle Rock Studios on this project) used it as a sort of Trojan horse for Half-Life 2, bundling it with all copies of that game before it was eventually released as a standalone product.</p>
<p>The visual upgrade was massive and certainly enticed many new users to check out the series, not to mention the praise from reviewers, who awarded the game an 88/100 score on average. While some hardcore players maintained that the original Counter-Strike had deeper gameplay, CS:S eventually won over the wider community, as evidenced by the 96% positive user reviews on Steam. It helped Counter-Strike stay relevant for another eight years before the launch of Global Offensive in 2012.</p>
<p>Personally, I was always way more of a fan of Rainbow Six, but Counter-Strike's tight-knit community impressed me even then. That they managed to not only maintain but even expand such a high level of commitment from fans after all these years is commendable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/halo-2-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Halo 2 - November 15, 2004</h2>
<p>With Halo: Combat Evolved, Bungie forever changed the landscape for first-person shooters in console gaming. At that time, the consensus was that PC was the platform to go to when it came to FPS titles. Halo erased that stereotype and became the biggest Xbox exclusive, creating an enormous amount of hype for its sequel. Microsoft pushed for this to be more than just another game launch, treating it like the biggest blockbuster movies. Its trailer aired in theaters, and there was even an alternative reality game called I Love Bees that attracted a lot of attention to the release.</p>
<p>The goal was largely achieved, as the game grossed $125 million on its opening day, more than Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, cementing gaming's new status as the biggest entertainment medium in the world. Overall, Halo 2 was tied with GTA: San Andreas regarding the 95/100 review score, while GTA ultimately outsold it thanks to its availability on PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>In this case, I was absolutely part of the large user base that followed this launch very closely. I loved the predecessor and thoroughly enjoyed the sequel despite the controversial campaign choices. When it comes to gameplay and multiplayer features, Halo 2 might just be the best the series has ever been to this day.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SI_GCN_MetroidPrime2Echoes-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes - November 15, 2004</h2>
<p>On the same day, Nintendo launched the sequel to 2002's Metroid, a first-person adventure game with shooter elements. Developed like the original by Texas-based company Retro Studios, it garnered widespread praise for its visuals, level design, and longevity (the game required more than 20 hours to complete), averaging a 92/100 score on Metacritic. It was also the first installment in the series to add multiplayer support, although it wasn't exactly its strongest feature.</p>
<p>Nintendo even tried to mimic Halo 2's viral marketing with some fake websites. However, the game's commercial success was nowhere near the likes of Halo 2 due to the underwhelming sales of Nintendo's GameCube platform. It took many years for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes to become a million-seller, although that is no fault of the game itself, which to this day is considered to be one of the best entries in a revered franchise.</p>
<p>While I owned a GameCube, I had sold it already by that point. As such, I did not play Metroid Prime 2 at launch, though I wished I had after seeing all the glowing reviews and impressions online. Despite the not-so-strong sales, this sequel ensured the IP would continue to be one of the most anticipated by Nintendo fans.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life-2-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Half-Life 2 - November 16, 2004</h2>
<p>The following day, Valve released Half-Life 2. It had been six years since the original game had reinvented the single player first-person shooter genre, and the hype was already at dangerously high levels. On top of that, as said before, Valve bundled Counter-Strike Source with the game, ensuring people would get Half-Life 2 despite the then-controversial requirement to install it through Steam, their new digital store.</p>
<p>That alone would probably be enough to make it worth remembering, given the huge impact Steam would have on the gaming landscape. But Half-Life 2 was far more than that. Like GTA: San Andreas for open world games, HL2 showed gaming that shooters could be much more immersive and story-driven without sacrificing any gameplay depth. Reviewers clearly agreed, rating it 96/100 on average, the highest score for a game released in 2004.</p>
<p>When I played it on my PC, I couldn't believe its visuals. Back then, the newly released Source engine was the most advanced piece of technology available, and it also came with the built-in Havok physics engine to deliver far higher levels of interactivity with the environments than gamers were used to. The combination of the two left me in awe, to say the least, although I did have a personal issue while playing: motion sickness. I've never had a problem playing first-person games, but something in Half-Life 2 always left me vaguely nauseous after around twenty minutes. A pity, as it's clearly one of the best shooters ever made. Now, I can't wait to see the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-gets-stunning-new-video-to-celebrate-the-games-20th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Remix project</a> be released and try once again to step in the shoes of Gordon Freeman.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/8bbb356c33d8a97cd6ec70793c81aa29d55680f38e93688d61d69fe3fa831719-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines - November 16, 2004</h2>
<p>Half-Life 2 wasn't the only Source game to launch that day. Independent developer Troika Games, founded by some of the former creators of Fallout, also launched Vampire: The Masquerade -Bloodlines on November 16. However, being the first third-party developer to use Source came at a cost. The studio understandably had no experience with it and encountered several problems during development. As a result, the game was very buggy, which impacted its reception. Releasing in the middle of the busiest gaming month ever didn't help sales, which were a mere 80K units at launch.</p>
<p>Troika was later forced to close down, but the game garnered a lot of well-deserved respect and admiration over time for its excellent writing and atmosphere. For a long time, Bloodlines was synonymous with great choices and writing among RPG fans, becoming a respected IP despite the lack of big sales. This explains why a sequel is currently in the final stages of production. Bloodlines 2 will be a different game by a different developer, but at least there's another RTX Remix project for those who'd like to replay this classic RPG with modern graphics.</p>
<p>As an avid fan of roleplaying games, I absolutely loved Bloodlines and can still remember some of its most memorable moments, such as the creepy Ocean House Hotel mission. If you haven't played it yet and you are into the World of Darkness setting, it's still worth checking it out on the next Steam sale.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEaterMasterCollectionVersion-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater - November 17, 2004</h2>
<p>Another day, another masterpiece. While Xbox had Halo 2 and Nintendo had Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Sony could count on Konami's latest game in the revered MGS series. Once again designed and written by legendary creator Hideo Kojima, Snake Eater serves as a prequel to the entire franchise, featuring Naked Snake (also known as Big Boss) on a peculiar mission in the jungle. The game featured extensive new features, such as closed-quarter combat (CQC), camouflage, an injury system, and even some protosurvival elements that required players to eat regularly lest they suffer penalties to the stamina meter. With a Metacritic score of 91/100 and solid sales (2.6 million units by December 2004), the success was guaranteed.</p>
<p>To understand how iconic Metal Gear Solid 3 really is, just take a look at Konami's remake approach. They've picked Silent Hill 2 for their horror series and MGS3 for their action/adventure/stealth franchise because they are the most universally beloved installments in the respective franchises.</p>
<p>The great news is that if you haven't played the original, Konami has almost <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-playable-at-tgs-konami-provides-progress-update-explains-why-they-stayed-so-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished</a> remaking it. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater should launch early next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, allowing an entirely new generation of fans to check out this masterpiece. This includes myself, as I did not own a PlayStation 2 anymore at that time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/World-of-Warcraft-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>World of Warcraft - November 23, 2004</h2>
<p>Another hugely anticipated game was Blizzard's MMORPG set in the Warcraft universe. Fans had come to love the fantasy IP through three strategy games, but it was with World of Warcraft that Blizzard's franchise really exploded into critical mass. WoW was not the first MMORPG, but its innovations in accessibility (chiefly the reduced friction upon the player character's death), its vast and gorgeously styled game world, not to mention the well-designed classes, ushered in a new era for the genre. Following a highly positive critical reception of 93/100, the game continued attracting players for several years. The previous record for active subscribers was EverQuest's 500K accounts; World of Warcraft reached 12 million subscribers in 2010.</p>
<p>Rival companies spawned countless clones, but none ever came close to achieving the same level of success in the genre. World of Warcraft is, of course, the only game on the list that is still being <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-iii-reforged-2-0-and-warcraft-i-ii-remastered-out-now-world-of-warcraft-to-get-housing-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a>, although the original gameplay style was so successful that Blizzard created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-classic-cataclysm-season-of-discovery-qa-we-want-to-explore-some-of-the-unfinished-bits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Classic</a> mode.</p>
<p>For me, World of Warcraft was simply a home for so many years. I started playing in December 2004 during the European Closed Beta Test and remember being absolutely mesmerized by this huge online world despite not even being a big fan of the RTS games. MMORPGs turned out to be my favorite genre after all, and I spent countless hours between 2004 and 2011 in Azeroth, enjoying World of Warcraft's content and finding new friends in various guilds, too.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends and often find yourself in the Support position, there are a variety of ways you can help out your lane partner. Whether you want to <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be someone</a> who has a lot of crowd control, healing, or shielding, there is a lot of variety available for the Support. Some are a lot easier than others, and this guide will tell you all about the easiest supports to pick up if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">other guide on the best ADCs to play in League of Legends</a>.</p>
<h2>Best Beginner Supports in League of Legends</h2>
<p>There are a ton of champions you can play as a support, with some of them being off-meta and not being listed as a support as their primary role. However, those champions tend to be a bit more complicated. If you're getting into the game and are planning on laning with a friend, being a Support is a great way to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Soraka</strong> is an excellent support and has been a mainstay in the game since her introduction to the title when it was first released. She has the capability to damage, silence, and heal, giving her plenty of versatility. You can use your ability to heal an ally, which will siphon your health. However, your damaging ability will heal you as long as you hit the enemy champion. Soraka's ultimate is one of the best support ultimate, as it can heal every living ally. This is great to utilize in team fights or if you're in an aggressive lane and need to clutch heal you or your ADC.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sona</strong> is another fantastic support you can use, as she has a lot of utility, as she can heal, stun, damage and speed up allies. Sona is relatively easy to learn, as her abilities don't require any aiming except for her ultimate, which has a wide range. The only downside to Sona for beginners is trying to keep an eye on her mana usage and making sure to utilize her passive correctly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yuumi</strong> is quite possibly one of the easiest champions that you can play in League of Legends. The premise of Yuumi is to attach yourself to your laning partner so that you can heal them. However, during this time, you won't be able to deal any damage to the enemies. Despite that, you are completely invulnerable until the champion you're attached to dies, which is when you become separated and can heal and damage.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Blitzcrank</strong> takes a little bit more finesse but is still relatively easy to get to grips with as a beginner. Blitzcrank is a different kind of support in League of Legends, as he doesn't have any capability to heal or shield his allies. However, he has great crowd control, which can help set up some great kills. Depending on how you build Blitzcrank, you may even see yourself netting some of the kills, especially with your Ultimate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the best supports to start with in League of Legends if you're brand-new to the game. There are plenty more to try out, which you can do in bot games if you are worried about annoying your teammates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 Pro Matches Slim Model’s Power Consumption While Delivering Significantly Better Performance]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-power-slim-better-performance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-matches-slim-model%E2%80%99s-power-consumption-while-delivering-significantly-better-performance.1037916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-power-slim-better-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Among the most impressive aspects of the PlayStation 5 Pro is its ability to deliver much better performance than the base model while consuming similar power.</p>
<p>As part of their in-depth testing of the recently released console by Sony, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDp1C_4AD4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> tested the PlayStation 5 Pro power consumption running different games, including Elden Ring, which was not patched to take advantage of the system's unique features, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which did receive a PS5 Pro patch. In both games, the mid-generation refresh in Quality Mode consumed as much as the PlayStation 5 Slim while delivering much better performance and image quality, although the Slim console used for the test may have had some issues, as it was consuming more power than expected. Still, even compared to the base launch model, the new console's efficiency is very impressive, consuming around the same power to deliver significant improvements in both patched and unpatched. Additionally, this is highly indicative that the two systems' SoCs were produced using different process nodes, likely 4nm for the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Power Consumption Tested vs PS5 Slim vs Launch PS5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDp1C_4AD4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite its high price, the PlayStation 5 Pro is definitely a worthy purchase for those looking to experience PS5 games at their very best. In games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the system delivers significant improvements that enhance the experience considerably. The system is also delivering great 8K modes, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky 8K mode</a>, which is so good that it could start to change minds regarding the viability of such a high resolution.</p>
