			<p>Over 20 games are being removed from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-lost-48-of-player-count-in-july-2024/">PlayStation Plus Extra</a> and Premium games catalog, including some first-party PlayStation games that can only be played on PS5 through the PS Plus Classic's catalog.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/several-playstation-exclusives-are-leaving-ps-plus-on-playstation-5-soon/">VGC</a>, games like Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2, which are only playable on PS5 through the PS Plus Premium Classic catalog, will be exiting the service. Infamous Second Son is the other first-party title that will also be exiting the service.</p>
<p>The rest of the list includes big titles like Grand Theft Auto V and Batman: Arkham Knight, along with indie hits like Ghostrunner and Enter the Gungeon. The full list is below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>MotoGP 24</li>
<li>The Sims 4 Island Living</li>
<li>Resistance Fall of Man</li>
<li>Resistance 2</li>
<li>Walkabout Mini Golf</li>
<li>Synth Riders</li>
<li>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord - Frozen Empire</li>
<li>Before Your Eyes</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners - Retribution</li>
<li>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2</li>
<li>Stranded: Alien Dawn</li>
<li>The LEGO Movie 2 Video Game</li>
<li>Ghostrunner</li>
<li>Payday 2: Crimewave Edition</li>
<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</li>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet</li>
<li>Portal Knights</li>
<li>Enter the Gungeon</li>
<li>Batman Arkham Knight</li>
<li>Infamous Second Son</li>
</ul>
<p>Games are added and removed from subscription services like PS Plus all the time, but these removals especially sting as they recently follow the news of a price hike for all three tiers of PlayStation Plus in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">over 20 countries</a> around the world, including Canada, Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Colombia, and Chile, to name a few.</p>
<p>Removing games like the Resistance titles also feels especially egregious. The Resistance series is beloved by veteran PlayStation fans, many of whom feel like we should have had remasters of the whole series long ago. Short of having a working PS3 with copies of the games, once those games are removed from the service, there will be no legal way to play two games from a series that was once as important to PlayStation as Horizon or God of War is to them today.</p>
<p>If players can't access a full lineup of first-party games in these services, it won't be surprising when more players start to consider what they're actually paying for. Especially regarding the top level of PlayStation Plus's tiered service, since the classics library is what really separates PlayStation Plus Premium from the rest.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/io-interactive-co-founder-opens-new-studio-wombo-games-new-rogue-lite-raiders-of-blackveil-to-be-debut-project.1172532/</guid>

			<p>The co-founder of <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/">IO Interactive</a> and former chief creative officer at Square Enix,&nbsp; <strong><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Janos Flösser, </span></strong>has started a new studio based in Copenhagen called <a href="https://www.wombogames.com/">Wombo Games</a>. Alongside the new studio announcement, Flösser has also announced the studio's debut project, a new roguge-lite called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">Raiders of Blackveil</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Raiders of Blackveil is currently set to arrive on Steam in Early Access sometime this summer, and is described as an "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">action-packed</span></em> <em>rogue-lite</em>" that looks to "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">blend MOBA-inspired champions, RPG-style loot and PVE extraction gameplay to create a deeply strategic game filled with challenging, fun encounters that can be experienced alone or with friends</span></em>," according to a press release.</p>
<p>The setting is a dystopian fantasy world where you'll fight against an evil corporation run by humans named Blackveil. The human part is important because you're part of an animal rebellion against Blackveil, and either on your own or alongside two other animal friends in groups of three, you'll raid and plunder Blackveil in the fight to end the corporation's evil dominance.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Flösser describes Wombo Games as a mixture of industry veterans who have worked on games like Hitman, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex, paired with young, talented developers looking to make their mark on the video game industry.</p>
<p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"<em>Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world,</em></span>" said Flösser. "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year...</em>"</span></p>

<figure></figure>


<p>With summer just around the corner, hopefully we'll hear more about Raiders of Blackveil soon.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week.1172493/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GeForce NOW users who love roleplaying games have plenty to do this week with the launches of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-on-april-24th-on-pc-and-consoles-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The games may differ heavily when it comes to RPG design (the former is a classic Western open world action RPG with real-time combat, whereas Clair Obscur is a linear JRPG-inspired turn-based game with some innovative real-time elements). Still, they have a few things in common: they're both powered by Unreal Engine 5, available on Game Pass, and can now be played on NVIDIA's cloud platform if you don't have the required PC hardware.</p>
<p>Both games&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/tempest-rising-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/tempest-rising-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-super-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution upscaling</a>, which can be enabled by any GeForce NOW user with a Priority or Ultimate subscription. Oblivion Remastered takes it one step further with DLSS Frame Generation and hardware-accelerated Lumen ray-traced global illumination, both of which can be activated by GFN players with an Ultimate subscription.</p>
<p>We've covered Oblivion Remastered a lot in the past few days, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is also exciting. Critics have raved about it in their reviews, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">averaging over 90 in the Metacritic scores</a> across all platforms. You'll have to wait a bit longer to read our review, as Wccftech was not provided with an advance code and has only been able to access the game today with everyone else.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here's the full list of weekly GeForce NOW additions:</p>
<p><em>● The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game</em><br>
<em>Pass, April 22)</em><br>
<em>● Sunderfolk (New release on Steam, April 23)</em><br>
<em>● Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, April</em><br>
<em>24)</em><br>
<em>● Ace Attorney Investigations Collection (Steam and Xbox, available on the Microsoft Store)</em><br>
<em>● Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Demo (Steam and Xbox, available on the Microsoft Store)</em><br>
<em>● Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Demo (Steam)</em><br>
<em>● EXFIL (Steam)</em><br>
<em>● Sands of Aura (Epic Games Store)</em></p>
