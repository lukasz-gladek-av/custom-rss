			<p>In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/1uXFMBPEpXS1vSH7lPICnN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new post</a> released on the official Ubisoft website, those interested in Assassin's Creed Shadows would be able to read about what is coming in the game. This post specifically focuses on the progression loop of the game, as well as the mastery trees and abilities that are available for players to use. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to release on March 20, with pre-orders currently being available, which includes free access to the upcoming expansion called <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">Claws of Awaji</a>.</p>
<p>"Having two separate characters with unique archetypes in our feudal Japan world pushed us to rethink how we wanted to approach player progression," says Julien, Associate Game Director. "Our goal was to stay as close as possible to the philosophy of mastery and martial art."</p>
<p>Both Naoe and Yaskue will have multiple Mastery trees that they can invest in, with the trees being unique to both characters. The Mastery trees featured in the game are tied to the unique weapons that they can utilize, as well as the archetypes set for each character.</p>
<p>The weapon trees will allow you to improve your pre-existing skills, as well as learn new combos and increase weapon efficacy, which can help you progress through the game as combat gets harder. When it comes to the archetype trees in Assassin's Creed Shadows, there are multiple abilities you can unlock that will be beneficial for Naoe or Yasuke. For example, Yasuke can put points into samurai training, where he can then learn how to switch weapons mid-combo.</p>
<p>To be able to earn Mastery points to utilize the Mastery trees, you will need to level up your character, which can be done by undertaking quests and activities throughout feudal Japan. There will also be unique enemies that you can take down throughout the world, which will also provide you with Mastery points.</p>
<p>The blog post also goes on to explain Knowledge utility, as well as the equipment and stats that you will be dealing with in the game. There will also be a multitude of gear sets that you can collect in Assassin's Creed Shadows for both Naoe and Yasuke. The gear and weapons can be looted from chests or can be found on defeated enemies. It's also stated that the loot is largely randomized to provide players with a sense of unique discovery throughout the game.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has released multiple of these blog posts now to provide information for those who may be on the fence about Assassin's Creed Shadows, as well as those who are eagerly awaiting the game. Thus far, Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be one of the more <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">controversial games</a> in the franchise, with a lot of uproar across the community.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-is-getting-the-big-techrot-encore-update-on-march-19/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, during the latest Digital Extremes stream, the Canadian developer shared more details about the upcoming Warframe update Techrot Encore. Due to launch on March 19, this big update will add the 60th Warframe to the game, Temple.</p>
<p>Playing as this character, users will fire off heatwave projectiles, summon Techrot Subwoofer minions to buff nearby fans and debuff the haters, sing a Solo of the century to set off flame jets, and even call upon the sapient Infested guitar named Lizzie as an Exalted Weapon capable of firing projectiles at the pluck of a string and transforming into a flamethrower for a limited time.</p>
<p>There are also new Protoframes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flare (Temple), who aims to be the ultimate work of art, transcending the boundaries of both gender and biology.</li>
<li>Minerva (Saryn) and Velimir II (Frost), two hardened military veterans, once in love, and the adoptive parents of <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-available-everywhere-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> antagonist Major Rusalka.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to new content, the developers are introducing two new mission types to the game. One is Stage Defense, which reimagines the traditional defense mission type. In this one, you must defend Flare as they put on a memorial concert for the band members lost to the Scaldra's oppressive takeover of the city. Temporal Archimedea, on the other hand, is the most challenging Warframe mission type. In this new version, players group with Minerva and Velimir II to take on three back-to-back randomly selected missions, using Kaya's new Peely Pix system to select upgradeable modifiers that change the flow of each attempt. Lastly, as part of the studio's Make-A-Wish commitment to James Conlin, Techrot Encore adds the latest atomic racing mini-game as part of the Höllvania Mall Hub arcade collection, Ollie's Crash Course.</p>
<p>Today also marks the release of the Open Beta for the new Warframe mobile companion app, featuring Steam login support, improved navigation, and a redesign of the settings page. You can get it for iOS <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/KPfve5cm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and for Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalextremes.warframenexus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Megan Everett, Director of Community at Digital Extremes, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Warframe will officially turn 12 years old on March 7, a milestone none of us ever thought we would hit when we first started. We want to make sure our players know how thankful we are for them through our content plans this year. Techrot Encore marks not only the first major update of our 12th year but also the biggest ‘echoes’ update we’ve ever made to expand out something like Warframe: 1999. We’re stoked to finally bring our surreal space virus boy band to life and everything that comes with them, so get ready for the party of your lifetimes on March 19!</em></p>

<p>Today, Digital Extremes also aired a new live stream dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a>, the upcoming fantasy-themed game. The team offered more details on the latest update for Preludes (Pre-Alpha Test) players, including two new social hubs tied to the faction system, a faction-based side-quest system, and gameplay of the new caster weapon type. In addition to the previously announced Silent Rose faction, players can now pledge allegiance to two other factions if their goals align: Alca's Children and Kith of Kings.</p>
<p>There are two new social Enclave hubs reserved for each faction, where players can take on a new type of side quest to further each group's goals. Lastly, the aforementioned new caster weapon type shown in the stream is capable of firing bolts of energy from both hands and even tricking enemies into thinking you're unarmed.</p>
