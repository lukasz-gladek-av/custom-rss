			<p>it's been announced today that Electronic Arts has acquired TRACAB's Advanced Tracking Technology to help provide a more accurate and precise experience in its EA SPORTS titles. The company has reached an agreement to acquire TRACAB Technologies, a leader in advanced sports optical tracking and analysis solutions. This will prove to be highly beneficial for the future EA SPORTS titles, where it plans to leverage the power of TRACAB's technology, where it will be able to utilize advanced AI, machine learning, and real-time sports data to create realistic animation and provide an experience that is lifelike and similar to the real-world action of sports.</p>
<p>"Our EA SPORTS games are becoming living, breathing simulations of sport, and TRACAB's cutting-edge technology and expertise in real-time data capture and analysis will enable us to enhance realism, immersion, and engagement in all our experiences," says Cam Weber, President of EA SPORTS.</p>
<p>While the company has acquired the technologies, EA SPORTS is looking ahead at how it will be able to utilize TRACAB beyond games, looking into the company's vision for the EA SPORTS app to be the leading interactive sports platform in the world. It's been said by Electronic Arts that the acquisition is expected to close in EA's first fiscal quarter of FY26. The company's sports titles have been incredibly popular, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> being an instant hit.</p>
<p>"Joining EA SPORTS marks an exciting new chapter for TRACAB Technologies. Our mission has always been to push the boundaries of sports data and analysis, and with EA SPORTS' vast resources and vision for innovation, we're confident that we can create even more immersive and dynamic experiences for sports fans around the world," says Martin Brogren, GM of TRACAB Technologies.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar with TRACAB Technologies, the technology utilized by the company tracks almost everything that is happening on the field or pitch at 60Hz per second. That means it's generating 600 million data points per game, as well as 65 unique data points per player and referee. It does this by capturing live skeleton data from 21 joints on each body on the pitch.</p>
<p>Doing this provides a new sense of realism for the player and can allow for more dynamic animation and real-time simulation, and it will prove to be incredibly beneficial for Electronic Arts when developing its new sports games.</p>
<p>Aside from the games being made by the company, combining the game engine with the work of TRACAB's Technologies aims to provide fans with new opportunities to create highlights and predictive simulations that they can upload on the EA SPORTS App.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-the-ea-sports-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA SPORTS App</a> is only available in Spain, but there are plans to expand it and make it available in other regions across the globe.</p>
