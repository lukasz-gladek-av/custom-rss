			<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition may not be too far from release on Nintendo Switch 2, as the new edition of the popular action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware has been recently rated in the United States.</p>



<p>As the game has been available for a while on other formats, the Switch 2 edition's ESRB rating, which can be found <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40550/elden-ring-tarnished-edition/">here</a>, wouldn't have been notable if the game's release date was known. However, the fact that the rating has been made public shortly before this week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namco-summer-showcase-my-hero-academia-game/">Bandai Namco showcase</a> suggests that the release date announcement and subsequent release may not be too far in the future.</p>



<p>The Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition was among the third-party games revealed during the big Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event held back in April. The new edition of the celebrated game will come with new features not found in the original release, such as two new starting classes, four new Armor sets, new weapons and skills, three Torrent customization options, and some yet-to-be-detailed quality-of-life improvements. The Tarnished Edition will also include the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a></strong>, which introduces a second map and some pretty challenging enemies.</p>



<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on Nintendo Switch 2. You can learn why the base game is one of the best action RPGs by FromSoftware by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Bandai Namco isn't done talking about what it has coming down the pipeline, as the company announced it will host its own Bandai Namco Summer Showcase this week on <strong>July 2, 2025, at 12pm PT/3pm ET/8pm BT.</strong> </p>



<p>The showcase will feature more information on a number of titles Bandai Namco is publishing, including news on the recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/code-vein-ii/">Code Vein II</a>, the upcoming RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/">Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> from former CD Projekt RED developers at their new studio Rebel Wolves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tekken-8/">Tekken 8</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/">Little Nightmares III</a>, and Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, to name a few of the 12 games from Bandai's portfolio that'll be shown off.</p>



<p>Chief among the 12 titles being shown in this showcase is the one that we know very little about, as Bandai Namco is set to premiere a brand-new My Hero Acadedmia title at this Wednesday's showcase. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Here's the full list of titles Bandai Namco has committed to showing at this Summer Showcase event:</p>



<ul>
<li>Code Vein II</li>



<li>Death Note Killer Within</li>



<li>Digimon Story Time Stranger</li>



<li>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</li>



<li>My Hero Academia</li>



<li>Little Nightmares III</li>



<li>Patapon 1+2 Replay</li>



<li>Shadow Labyrinth</li>



<li>Super Robot Wars Y</li>



<li>Tekken 8</li>



<li>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</li>



<li>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</li>
</ul>



<p>Though this month has already included plenty of new information on titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares III</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-looks-suitably-witchery-in-new-gameplay-overview-2026-launch-confirmed/">The Blood of the Dawnwalker</a>, most of the games on the list are titles that players have been waiting to hear more about.</p>



<p>Plenty of them have release dates, with Super Robot Wars Y, Shadow Labyrinth, and Patapon 1+2 Replay all due out this summer, in August for the former and July for the latter two games. While Digimon Story Time Stranger, Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, and Little Nightmares III are all due out in September and October. </p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll get better looks at gameplay for each of these titles, as some of them are due out in the next few weeks.</p>
