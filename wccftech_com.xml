			<p>2025 is going to be a jam-packed year for new games being released, but who could forget about the many DLCs and expansions that are confirmed to be happening this year? Admittedly, some have yet to be detailed or even announced, but the ones that have been are bound to keep you watching the calendar for their release date. Without further ado, here is Wccftech's most anticipated DLC of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-multiplayer-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em></p>

<h2>Atomic Heart: Enchantment Under the Sea (January 28)</h2>
<p>This expansion actually launches today on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 2023 launch</a>, Atomic Heart has already received two DLCs, both of which have been welcomed with mixed feelings across the board. However, the third time's the charm, right? In this DLC, you will return to Facility 3826 as Major P-3, with Twin at your side as you go diving into the depths and explore uncharted watery depths to try and save humanity.</p>

<h2>Age of Empires 4 Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>The name of the upcoming DLC hasn't been revealed yet, but World's Edge has confirmed that there will be a new DLC coming at some point in 2025 for Age of Empires 4. So far, the game has received a lot of seasonal content, but it has also received a mixture of <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-iv-anniversary-season-3-upate-ottomans-malians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free</a> and paid DLC. These DLCs have added the Ottomans and Malians to the game, as well as a paid DLC called The Sultans Ascend, which added other civilizations to the game. Hopefully, the DLC is what the fans have been hoping for.</p>

<h2>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle - The Order of Giants (TBA)</h2>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the best games released in 2024</a>. Needless to say, we're eager to get our hands on its announced story-driven DLC, The Order of Giants, which is included with the purchase of the Premium Edition. As implied by the title, this expansion should shine further light on the secretive organization that the main game reveals to be actually named Nephilim Order. There's little doubt that Indiana will once again face many shenanigans in this new adventure, though we don't know who else might appear in it - could we see other familiar faces from the movies? Only time will tell.</p>

<h2>Lies of P Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is another DLC that doesn't have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/">confirmed release date yet</a>. However, we do know that it is slated for release this year, possibly in the first quarter, while Neowiz is also working on a sequel to Lies of P that is coming in the future. It's uncertain as to what this DLC will be about, but it's perfect for those who enjoyed Lies of P or are wanting more of the soulslike experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rain-world-the-watcher-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Rain World: The Watcher (March 28)</h2>
<p>Rain World has already received a fair bit of new content over the years since its release in 2017, with Downpour being the first major DLC that the game received back in 2023. Luckily, for those who are a fan of the slugcats, Rain World will be getting its second paid DLC, named The Watcher, released on March 28, 2025. While January has been going on for what feels like ten years, it will soon be over, meaning March will be even closer than before.</p>
