			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the most impressive-looking open-world RPGs ever released, thanks to mods such as the DreamPunk mod which elevates the game's visuals to new levels of realism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams">3.1.1 version</a> of the mod and the enhancements it brings to the game developed by CD Projekt Red are showcased in an 8K resolution video shared by the creator of the mod, NextGen Dreams, on YouTube. The new version of the mode redefines all the features seen in the previous versions at a small performance cost, introducing a new LUT designed to extend the lower dynamic range of the game, enhanced path tracing configuration, and more. The video also showcases the custom-made photo realistic camera shake shader, which looks great for gameplay showcases and free roaming.</p>

<p>With the development of Cyberpunk 2077 concluded, except for the development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>, which is launching next month together with the next-generation Nintendo system, CD Projekt Red is now entirely focused on the development of the second entry in the series, currently known as Project Orion. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/">Earlier this week</a>, the creator of the Cyberpunk universe revealed that the game will feature a second city to explore besides Night City, a city that was described as a sort of Chicago gone wrong, with a very different vibe than the city players have explored alongside V in the original game.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The game will launch on Nintendo Switch on June 5th.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 version of Starfield should be revealed and released this year, according to a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, NateTheHate, who has proven to be extremely reliable in the past, revealed that the PS5 version of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda is planned to be revealed this year, although the timing of the announcement is not yet clear at the moment. The leaker also expects the gap between the announcement and release to be minimal, so the game should be available on Sony's console this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Starfield is coming to PS5 &amp; intent should be announced this year. It's just a matter of when will the announcement happen.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925235866357608928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I would expect the gap between announcement and release to be minimal.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925247880534602007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A Starfield PlayStation 5 port has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-release-playstation-5/">rumored</a> for a while, but no concrete evidence of the port being actively in the works surfaced online. The only hint we have received so far is the appearance of the PlayStation 5 logo on a Creation listing back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-release-imminent/">March</a>, which suggested that the game isn't too far from releasing on Sony's current-generation console. With the "Not-E3" season approaching, it wouldn't be surprising to see the port officially announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Starfield launched in 2023 on PC and Xbox Series X|S, followed by the Shattered Space expansion in 2024. While the expansion provides a tighter narrative, it doesn't add anything the base game needs to become a better game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review</a>. Hopefully, future expansions will do a better job improving the game, which has, in my opinion, a lot of unrealized potential.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

						<h5>Deliver At All Costs</h5><p><span>May 22, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>When I first heard about <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-at-all-costs-is-a-top-down-action-game-published-by-konami/">Deliver At All Costs</a>, it was through Steam Next Fest buzz from earlier in the year. I didn't see much of it, I didn't even check out the demo at the time, because I was busy going through a bunch of other Steam Next Fest games. But I kept seeing it pop up on the lists I would read of Next Fest demos to check out. It looked interesting, and like it would be a fun and funny game to play for a few hours.</p>
<p>That cursory knowledge of it made me jump at the chance to review it, and now that I've played it all the way through, I'm glad that I knew next to nothing about it before going in. If I were more aware of what to expect, I feel like I wouldn't have enjoyed the best parts of Deliver At All Costs as much as I did.</p>
<p>But those good parts don't last, and by the time credits rolled, I was left hoping Deliver At All Costs hadn't tried to do as much as it did, and instead stayed closer to the ground as just a wacky delivery game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Deliver At All Costs starts as a small story about Winston Green, a young engineering prodigy that fell into some mysterious trouble that's landed him in an island town, living in a motel where he's about to be evicted, struggling to find work like everyone else on the island of St. Monique after a project connecting the island to the big city has crumbled the local economy.</p>
<p>A radio ad has you rushing to a local delivery company for a job, and it's here where you first experience the...annoying, to say the least, driving controls. On the one hand, I get it. The driving is supposed to be annoying to some degree, and that's part of the comedy that comes from the kind of oddball deliveries you make in the first two acts of the game.</p>
<p>The obstructed isometric view, what often felt like far too many townsfolk walking around and cars on the road, the hundreds of objects and environmental hazards, are all meant to up the ante when you're trying to deliver a bomb without it exploding on your way to its intended home.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I get what developer Far Out Games is trying to do. But the grace period my understanding offered ended well before Deliver At All Costs did. I spent most of my nine hours completing the story frustrated at best and laughing through mild annoyance at worst when it came to the core of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Those 'best' parts came early in my nine hours, when I was going from delivery to delivery, watching the stakes get raised in new and comical ways. I was also increasingly intrigued by how the story was evolving. Even at best, it was never as cinematic and dramatic as it was clearly trying to be, but the voice acting and writing had their moments that made me want to find out what happened next.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I also appreciated the characters around Winston at the start, like Norman, Johnny and Harald. Even Donovan and Bertha, as antagonists, had potential in my eyes when I early on in my journey with Deliver At All Costs. Too bad nothing ever came of that potential. I'll hold off on story details for the sake of not spoiling the experience of anyone who still wants to play the game through to credits, but the bottom line is that the story goes nowhere.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's a whole lot of setup and no follow-through, with an ending that feels so disconnected from what the game begins as. Frankly, I would call the whole thing confusing, but I skipped past that and went all the way to relief that the game was over and I that once this review goes live, I wouldn't have to think about Deliver At All Costs again.</p>
<p>The story doesn't just stumble because it's undercooked, though. It was often impossible to take any of the scenes seriously because the way characters move and talk in cutscenes looked awful, and again, disconnected. The camera would be close up in a characters face, almost as if to make sure you watched how the characters mouth moved in entirely the wrong way for the words they were saying and that nothing looked synched up.</p>
<p>When it happens once or twice, it feels like a bug. When it happens in almost every scene, it starts to feel like something the team either didn't notice, or more likely they did, and had no time to fix it so it was left unfinished. Which is the sum feeling I got when I hit credits. That so much about Deliver At All Costs was unfinished.</p>
<figure>
<div>

	</p></div></div>
</figure>



<p>That unfinished feeling also didn't go away with the other half of how the story is told, through Winston's journal entries for each chapter. Jumping into the menu, you can read about events that aren't depicted in the game, but in some cases are unfortunately far more interesting than the events that did end up being depicted through cutscenes or gameplay.</p>
<p>As if these were the moments left on the cutting room floor that Far Out Games still wanted to include, since they were narratively important, but didn't fit in the production timeline the studio had. Again, it felt like I was playing a trimmed down, unfinished and bad version of a fuller, better game.</p>
<p>Save for one area of the game, and that's the setting. Exploring St. Monique, Shellington and New Reed felt like getting to play in three massive diorama's of different kinds of towns and cities. Like everyone you'd pass on the road was a little plastic or wooden toy that had come to life, and you're driving around and smashing up each area like a kid would, if they were given free-reign in the massive miniature city their parent had meticulously crafted.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Each location is extremely detailed, and while I didn't love having the screen go to black with a title card for every time you exit and enter different parts of the map or the interior of the few buildings you can enter, what got me through that was knowing I'd be met with a bright, detailed, and charming area to wreak havoc in.</p>
<p>The setting and visual style is so good, in fact, that I could have forgiven the story's shortcomings a lot more if the gameplay was worth sticking around for. Unfortunately, it never meaningfully evolves, in both the main and side missions, the latter of which are almost frustratingly inconsequential, as some of them have you track down other cars that you can do basically nothing with.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's also a pretty huge miss that, in a game where you're encouraged to drive through buildings, you can't freely use whatever gadgets you can stick to your company truck to cause even more damage when driving through buildings or terrorizing the town.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'm disappointed to have to say that I wouldn't recommend Deliver At All Costs. It's a game that tries to do way too much, and because it fails at so much of what it tries, it sours the experience of the things it was doing really well when you first start playing.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Deliver At All Costs has some genuinely fun and funny moments in its early hours, when you're bright-eyed and looking forward to how the game could potentially evolve, and what crazy tasks you'll be asked to complete while destroying half the toy-looking city. Which is what makes it all the more disappointing that it goes nowhere, and you quickly realize that all you have is a game with (at best) mediocre controls, a story that has no follow-through for all its setup, and gameplay that never improves beyond what you could play in the game's free demo.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september.1196253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-september-release/"> Insider Gaming</a>, the first major DLC release for Assassin's Creed Shadows, 'Claws of Awaji' is due to launch this coming September 2025.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji isn't the first new bit of story content we've seen for Assassin's Creed Shadows since it launched in March. That came from the update that arrived earlier this month on May 6, with a new story quest, 'The Works of Luis Frois'.</p>
<p>There's also going to be more story content coming in June, according to Ubisoft's current <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shares-year-one-roadmap-and-theres-no-mention-of-multiplayer/">roadmap</a>, with a new quest and the addition of a new ally to add to the league of Assassins you build over the course of the game's story. Both the quest that came earlier this month and the new one coming in June were added to the game as part of free updates.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji will be the first bit of paid DLC content, and is expected to include an <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">additional 10 hours of gameplay</a>, a new region to explore, and new weapons for players to rush head-first into battle with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Digital Deluxe Edition" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X_x9A5c2_TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And regarding more coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows, Insider Gaming also claims that the previously rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/">co-op mode</a> will arrive sometime next year, and that while you might have assumed that a co-op mode in Shadows meant that you and a friend could play as Naoe or Yasuke, the mode will include more than just the game's two main protagonists.</p>
<p>On the co-op mode, Insider Gaming claims a source told them that, "<em>While they're obviously central characters [Naoe and Yasuke], there's a deeper narrative tied into the co-op that will expand the experience beyond just the two of them.</em>"</p>
<p>One of Shadows' main mechanics is the ability to call-up other members of the league during gameplay, which now feels like a precursor to this <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer/">upcoming co-op mode</a>, if it is the case that you'll be able to take control of other league members in the yet-to-be-announced co-op mode.</p>
<p>While the fate of Ubisoft still feels very <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">uncertain</a>, Shadows has been the company's bright light for the year so far. It is currently the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/">second-best-selling game in the US for 2025 so far</a>, with no signs of it slowing down.</p>
