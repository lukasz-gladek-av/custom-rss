			<p>EA is going to be acquired by an investor consortium for $55 billion, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">widely rumored last week.</a></p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">press release shared today</a>, the publisher of successful titles like the Battlefield series, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">highly anticipated sixth entry is launching next month on PC and consoles</a>, confirmed it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor consortium comprised of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an all-cash transaction of $55 billion. Going into further details, the agreement's terms indicate the Consortium will acquire 100% of EA, with PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company.</p>



<p>The press release continues that the acquisition agreement was given the go-ahead by the EA's Board of Directors after the opportunity was carefully evaluated. According to Luis A. Ubiñas, the Lead Independent Director of the board, it was concluded that the opportunity delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders.</p>



<p>Although EA has entered into the acquisition agreement, the transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, and will be subject to closing conditions, including approval of regulatory bodies and EA stockholders. After the transaction is closed, EA's common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p>



<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of EA, commented on the news, saying:<em> "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work. Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</em></p>

			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/">supposedly launching next year</a> is reportedly going to use a hybrid engine setup with Unreal Engine 5 and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine, as well as modern gameplay features and tweaked level design.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming"> Rebs Gaming</a>, who proved their reliability in the past by reporting correct information before official announcements, such as the launch date for Halo Infinite multiplayer component, reported some new details on the rumored remake, relied by an unnamed source who received it from a developer who works for a co-development studio which has previously worked with 343 Industries on the Halo: The Master Chief Collection and is now handling a lot of the remake's core development.</p>



<p>According to the new information, the current Halo Combat Evolved remake build features sprinting, which is not available in the original. Although the introduction of a modern FPS gameplay mechanic can be divisive, its inclusion would be hardly surprising, considering series co-creator Marcus Lehto talked about more contemporary core mechanics that improve gameplay among features of a potential remake that would enhance the original experience. Regarding gameplay, the remake is said to feature tweaked level design for maps like The Library.</p>



<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake will also reportedly be powered by two engines like this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, using Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay logic and world systems. This setup would ensure modern visuals and faithful gameplay, although using UE5 for graphics could lead to performance issues, as we have seen time and time again in way too many games released in the past few months, especially if <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-performance-issues-caused-development-process/">optimization work is not done properly, as suggested by Epic CEO last month</a></p>

<p>Although Rebs Gaming has proved to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new information, and even the development of a Halo Combat Evolved remake, with a grain of salt. Thankfully, it shouldn't take much longer to learn if the game is really in development, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo Studios will reveal the future of the series at HaloWC 2025 next month.</a></p>
