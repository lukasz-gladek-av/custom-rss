			<p>Square Enix and Tactic Studios have announced that the multiplayer murder mystery game KILLER INN will host a Closed Beta Test this weekend on Steam. The CBT is set to begin on Friday, July 25, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time and will be live until Monday, July 28, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time. Access can be requested <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the store page</a>.</p>



<p>The developers warned that this is first and foremost a test meant to verify how the servers hold up when a large number of players join the game at the same time. This version also lacks the tutorials that will be available when the game actually launches in the near future.</p>



<p>KILLER INN is an asymmetrical competitive game where players are divided into two teams. The larger group (16) of players is called Lambs and faces off against a smaller group (8) of Wolves. Each team must reduce the other team's ranks through combat—the first team to eliminate all of the other team's members wins. The difference is that the Wolves know who their teammates are from the start, but the Lambs don't know which of their teammates may actually be a Wolf.</p>



<p>Whenever a Wolf kills a Lamb, at least one clue is left behind. Lambs must gather these clues to figure out the Wolves' identities. When coming across a corpse, players must ensure to pick up any clues on it, as this is an essential aspect of the game. To survive, players will need weapons and armor. They can get them either by opening chests with tokens earned after completing quests for the castle's staff members in the castle, or saving up gold to buy items from the in-game shop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles' Classic mode, which will allow players to experience the original game released back in 1997 on the first PlayStation, has been built from scratch, as the original source code has been lost, but this allowed the development team to add content that was cut from the original release.</p>



<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/21/the-secrets-behind-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-makeover/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the game's director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed once again that the Classic mode, which attempts to recreate the original as faithfully as possible, has been created from scratch, as the original master data and source code have been lost. As Maehiro-san highlighted, back in the day, developers didn't have effective resource management tools as they do today, and games were essentially developed by overwriting the previous code every time a bug was fixed or a language option was added.</p>



<p>As the Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Classic mode is meant to provide an experience faithful to the original, the development team also had the option of emulating the original, but doing so would have prevented them from making granular improvements. Eventually, it was decided that the best option would be to rebuild the original game from scratch. This choice paid off in a big way, as recreating the original experience gave the team a solid foundation upon which to create the Enhanced version, and add features that were cut from the original, such as character dialogues playing during battles under certain conditions that will help flesh out story character after they have joined Ramza's party. This is, in my opinion, a great addition, as it was sad to see this characters slide in the background and essentially become like generic units.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles will include some new features not seen in the original, it may not be the definitive edition some were waiting for, as tt won't feature the additional content seen in the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile release is based. <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">The decision</a> to not include this extra content was made because the remaster's main goal was to be as faithful to the original as possible.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on September 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-breaks-5-million-players-but-ubisoft-reports-lower-than-expected-performance-for-rainbow-six-siege.1250679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting its Q1 2025 financial results</a>, Ubisoft revealed that Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to perform well. After reaching 3 million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of March</a>, the game has now surpassed 5 million unique players, who have collectively performed 2 billion stealth kills, traveled 1 billion kilometers, and petted 38 million animals. However, the publisher's quarterly financial results still reported lower than anticipated net bookings, mostly due to issues with Rainbow Six Siege, as noted in the below statement by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot:</p>



<p><em>The first quarter delivered mixed results. On the positive side, Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivered on its expectations, with now more than 5 million unique players since its launch, and Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth. However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft also noted that the other two causes for the lower net bookings include a 'partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2 and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact'.</p>



<p>Guillemot then added that Ubisoft will continue creating so-called Creative Houses. The hope is that these business units will boost creative vision and business performance. The first one is, of course, the subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year, which is set to oversee the Rainbow Six, Far Cry, and Assassin's Creed franchise. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> recently, it will be led by Christopher Derennes and Yves Guillemot's own son.</p>



<p>As for the Assassin's Creed Shadows expansion, Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft only reiterated that it's coming in their fiscal Q2 and will offer more than 10 hours of new content, as well as a new weapon, skills, and abilities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it might launch as early as September, although if that's truly the case, an official announcement will have to be made soon by the publisher.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-bethesda-reiterates-exciting-things/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-gets-new-beta-update-as-bethesda-reiterates-%E2%80%98exciting-things%E2%80%99-are-on-the-way.1250661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1947686948799389848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new beta update for Starfield on Steam. As usual, interested users can check it out by selecting the beta build in the game's tab via the Steam library. This is, however, a minor patch, as you can easily glean from the changelog:</p>



<p><strong><em>General</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Minor improvements to format and display in Creations menus.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed an issue that could cause that Extreme Temperature gear to appear incorrectly.</em></li>



<li><em>Minor improvements to sorting in the Missions Menu.</em></li>



<li><em>General crash and stability fixes.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>More interesting is the fact that Bethesda has reiterated its promise that 'exciting things' are on the way to Starfield, and more details about those will be revealed 'in the coming months'. The development studio had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> as much back in March, following a fairly long period of silence. </p>



<p>Game Director Todd Howard had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that the sci-fi roleplaying game would receive annual story expansions. However, the lack of any such announcement and today's reiteration that it will take months before we hear about those exciting new things all but confirms the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumor</a> that the second expansion won't launch in 2025 after all.</p>



<p>This could perhaps be tied to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly delayed PlayStation 5 port</a>. Bethesda might want to bundle a second expansion when the game launches on Sony's console. Another side is that the developers are possibly trying to deliver a more impactful expansion after the underwhelming Shattered Space, which got a middling reception, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6/10 score here</a> from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo:</p>



<p><em>The Starfield: Shattered Space expansion offers an engaging new story but adds little beyond that. Fans of the game's universe will appreciate spending more time in it and discovering a faction more complex than it appeared in the base game, but those who didn't enjoy Starfield or were primarily interested in its space exploration mechanics won't change their opinion with the expansion, as it doesn't address the vast majority of the issues that still plague the experience.</em></p>
