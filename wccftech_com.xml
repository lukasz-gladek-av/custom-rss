			<p>Players have asked EA for years to bring back the Skate series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-announced/">four years ago</a>, EA finally answered those prayers with the official confirmation that the skateboarding series would indeed be coming back.</p>
<p>Four years later, we know that was just an announcement at the time and that this new Skate game was only beginning its development when EA confirmed the series' return. But now that we're <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">approaching its early access</a> release sometime this year, we're learning more about it, and the latest bit of confirmed news is one that definitely won't go down well with fans.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">Eurogamer</a>, developer Full Circle confirmed that the new Skate game will not have an offline mode. You'll always need to be online and connected to the game's servers when playing. In an FAQ section towards the bottom of a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">new blog</a> from Full Circle, the studio bluntly answered the question about an offline mode.</p>
<p>"<em>The simple answer: No. The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You'll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection.</em>"</p>
<p>It's disappointing news for veteran fans of the series, many of whom likely don't want to be bothered with the live service elements of the new Skate game. They were just looking to spend hours enjoying the skateboarding mechanics and feeling that only the Skate series provided back when the original trilogy was in its heyday.</p>
<p>While this new Skate game will launch in early access later this year, Full Circle also confirmed that more than 200,000 players have already gotten the chance to check it out in the game's closed alpha test that's been running since September 2024. If you want to join that number, you can still sign up for the playtest and hope to be selected. There's also always the hope that Full Circle will run an open beta ahead of the early access release closer to the launch.</p>

			<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> unsurprisingly shadow-dropped earlier this week, plenty of RPG fans began to feel concerned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-mod-removes-30-fps-cutscene-cap-fixes-ultrawide-resolutions-fov-issues-and-more/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a brand-new RPG, from new studio Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<p>Those concerns ended up being unnecessary, as Sandfall Interactive <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915777375834452273">announced today</a>, after Clair Obscur launched yesterday, that the game had already surpassed <strong>500,000 copies sold</strong>. A feat made even more impressive by the fact that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also launched directly into Xbox Game Pass, and hundreds of thousands of players still chose to spend the money to grab a copy of their own.</p>
<p>It's terrific news for Sandfall, with Clair Obscur being the studio's debut title. Along with the commercial success, Clair Obscur has found great critical success, joining <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-plus-extra-premium-april-2025-lineup-includes-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-battlefield-1-and-more/">Blue Prince</a> as one of the two games currently sitting at a 92 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Metacritic</a>. At this point, instead of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 getting overshadowed by Oblivion, you might even be able to say that the opposite is true, with Oblivion being the return of a beloved but also old RPG that millions of people have already played.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new series from a new studio, offering a new experience to players that resonates with RPG fans. Of course by the end of the year it'll be interesting to see where Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 lands in conversations about what's the best game of the year, but already it seems like Clair Obscur could be 2025's version of a game like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, in that it's a new RPG on the scene that has people talking about it all year long.</p>
<p>It's also, like Metaphor, competing against a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">legacy RPG series</a> and showing how far RPGs have come over the years.</p>

			<p>A new DOOM: The Dark Ages trailer was shared today, providing a new look at the game running on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The new trailer, presented by game director Hugo Martin, introduces the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/25/revealing-cosmic-realm-gameplay-from-doom-the-dark-ages-out-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cosmic Realm</a>, a world the developer wanted to incorporate into the DOOM universe for a while. This Lovecraftian dimension, which looks quite haunting, is home to fearful enemies like the twin-bladed Cosmic Baron, the powerful Cacodemon, and more. You can take a look at how the Cosmic Realm runs on PlayStation 5 Pro below.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages - Cosmic Realm First Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVBI55DbNQI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages promises to be not only yet another engaging entry in the series, but also an amazing showcase of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-id-tech-8-ray-tracing-vitualized-geometry/">id Tech 8 engine</a>, which delivers a world rendered using virtualized geometry, robust physics simulation, and ray-traced lighting at high performance. You can learn more about how the game spices up the modern DOOM series formula by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/">preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>That will be until you explore some of the newer things in DOOM: The Dark Ages. So, to put it quite simply, I could play parts of, not all, two different levels. You are essentially riding a DOOM Guy Gundam in the first of these two. The second, you get to fly a dragon with mecha wings and guns. Now, DOOMdam, as I will now call it, feels similar enough to other levels. It's just that you're now a big machine. You get to punch the hell out of Titans, sometimes shoot them, and there is a sense of scale due to the surrounding combat. I don't know how impactful it will feel over time, but it offered something different while still feeling like the DOOM we know.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches on May 15th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
