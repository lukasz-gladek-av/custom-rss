A good portion of the presentation focused on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ports</strong> launching this year for the current-generation Nintendo system, including <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-trio-of-bethesda-ports-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-fallout-4-indiana-jones-and-oblivion-remastered/"><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</strong></a></em></p>



<p>With the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">recent Nintendo Switch 2 port of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</em> running and looking great on the system</strong>, many are wondering how the console will ha<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ndle the second entry in the series</strong>, which is a more complex game in pretty much every aspect. Though too early to say, an early analysis of the only footage available to date suggests that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver a better experience than the Steam Deck</strong>.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">During the latest episode of their weekly podcast</a></strong>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry provided <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">an early analysis of the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Nintendo Switch 2 footage</strong> shared last week. At a glance, the new version of the game looks like a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">pared-down version of the PlayStation 5</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">version</strong> running at a lower resolution, but a deeper look shows <strong>how much the game had to be scaled down.</strong></p>



<p>Besides running at an internal resolution of <strong>720p</strong>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 will sport <strong>lower texture quality</strong> than on PlayStation 5 (which also brought a sensible reduction of the game's file size, which will be around 100 GB on Switch 2), <strong>reduced foliage, particle and density, removed shadows</strong> in some instances and <strong>lower shadows resolution</strong> in places where they are still in, and a <strong>sensibly worse hair rendering</strong>. Performance also seems iffy, with visible <strong>frame pacing issues</strong>, though these could be fixed in time for release.</p>



<p>While on paper these visual cutbacks may seem like a lot, the tech experts noted how <strong>they are only truly noticeable with side-by-side comparisons</strong> with the PlayStation 5 release. Ultimately, with platform-specific optimizations, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver a better experience than the Steam Deck</strong>, which obviously did not benefit from such optimizations.</p>

			<p>A little more than two years ago, while <strong>Capcom</strong> was enjoying the critical and commercial success of its latest <strong>Resident Evil</strong> remake at the time, <strong>Resident Evil 4 Remake</strong>, the company confirmed that players could expect <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-more-remakes-coming-capcom/">more remakes in the future</a></strong>. We didn't get any indication as to which games would get the RE Remake treatment next, but at this point, there are only so many options left.</p>



<p>Now, despite most of the rumours in the time since Capcom gave that confirmation circling around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-could-launch-h1-2027/">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a></strong>, a <strong>new ESRB rating</strong> (spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-re5-remake-capcom-xbox-series-2000667258">Kotaku</a>) may have just spoiled Capcom's plans for what's next: <strong>Resident Evil 5 Remake</strong>.</p>



<p>A couple of things point to the <strong><a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40376/resident-evil-5/">new rating</a></strong> indicating a full remake. For one thing, it's a rating for the game on <strong>Xbox Series</strong> consoles, and not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/26295/resident-evil-5/">original rating</a> that lists the PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo Switch as its available platforms. Second, it's the mention of "<em>in-game purchases</em>" that points to a remake rather than a re-release. </p>



<p>Anyone who has played the recent RE Remakes and modern RE games (or just modern Capcom games) will know that Capcom has started to include microtransactions that let players buy their way to unlocking everything in the game. If you don't want to bother with grinding to buy everything in the shop or earning all of the in-game rewards, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP0102-PPSA01556_00-UNLOCKALLREWARDS">you can spend a few bucks</a> to just have it all unlocked. A feature that is notably only included in modern RE titles, which in this case means all of the RE Remakes and everything after RE Biohazard. The re-releases of the original games do not include any such microtransactions.</p>



<p>Add to that the fact that <strong>Eva La Dare,</strong> who played <strong>Sheva Alomar</strong> in RE5, recently shared a post that seemed to hint towards new RE5-related news coming, and it seems like everything is coming together for an RE5 Remake reveal. That said, it's also worth noting that notable RE leaker, Dusk Golem, denies that we'll get a reveal for an RE5 Remake this year, and claims that La Dare's post is related to something else.</p>



<p>Golem instead insists that the next RE remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-resident-evil-remake-that-starts-with-c-and-ends-ode-veronica-will-be-announced-this-year-insider-claims/">we'll see is Code Veronica</a>, even going so far as to "<em>promise</em>" RE fans that it'll be announced over an RE5 Remake.</p>



<p>Of course, while leakers like Dusk Golem have been able to accurately predict announcements from Capcom before, their claims are rarely a guarantee. The only people we can confidently say really know what La Dare's post is about are La Dare and the developers at Capcom. If an RE5 Remake is announced, then that doesn't mean Code Veronica has been shelved permanently, if that is still on its way. </p>



<p>The reverse is also true, because this listing at least implies that Capcom is preparing some kind of new release for RE5. It's possible that we'll find out more at this week's upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/">State of Play</a></strong>, though that'll depend on whether Capcom wants to take any attention away from Requiem, which is launching at the end of this month.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Capcom Will Reveal a “Large Scale,” “Iceborne” and “Sunbreak”-Sized Expansion for Monster Hunter Wilds This Summer]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> will be getting a "<em><strong>large-scale expansion</strong></em>" later this year, with <strong>Capcom</strong> set to reveal the expansion at some point in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>, the company confirmed today in its update regarding what's coming to the game in February 2026.</p>



<p>After digging into what players can look forward to in Monster Hunter Wilds' new update, which is set to be out on <strong>February 18, 2026,</strong> producer <strong>Ryozo Tsujimoto </strong>concluded by looking ahead to what's next for Wilds as we move deeper into the year. </p>



<p>"<em>Now, I'd like to talk about what's next for Monster Hunter Wilds,</em>" Tsujimoto began. "<em>We are currently at work on a <strong>large-scale expansion</strong>, similar to <strong>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</strong> and <strong>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</strong> for Monster Hunter Wilds.</em> <em>We plan to share more information with you this summer, so please look forward to it."</em></p>



<p>That's about all the information we got on this coming expansion, but comparing it to both Iceborne and Sunbreak gives us an idea of how much will be included in this expansion. The added tease that it'll be revealed this summer also gives us two major options for when Capcom will reveal it: either <strong>Summer Game Fest</strong> or <strong>Gamescom</strong>. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWilds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MHWilds</a> Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto shares a look at the update arriving on Feb 18, and what's ahead in the future.</p><p>⛓ Arch-tempered Arkveld<br>⭐ 10-star Arch-tempered monsters<br>🐱 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHStories3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MHStories3</a> Special Collaboration<br>🍖 Design Contest Weapon &amp; Pendant<br>🎉 Anniversary Event + Event… <a href="https://t.co/MrqhiS2iAg">pic.twitter.com/MrqhiS2iAg</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/2021026692781965533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But that's all still months away. What's happening much, much sooner for Wilds players is the release of <strong>Update 1.041,</strong> which includes a 10-star Arch-tempered Arkveld quest (and 10-star quests for all the previous Arch-tempered monsters), a special collaboration with <strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</strong> to celebrate that game's coming arrival on <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong>March 13, 2026,</strong></a> and plenty of event quests to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Wilds' launch.</p>



<p>The coming update will also include a new weapon designed by the winning artist from Capcom's recent design contest. Only the winning design officially made it into the game, but all 16 finalists will be credited in the patch notes for the update.</p>

<p>Hopefully for Capcom, its 2026 plans and the coming expansion will be able to kick Monster Hunter Wilds into a new gear with regard to its commercial sales. Despite Capcom releasing several updates to address problems players had with the game, across its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/">technical issues</a></strong> and design issues, namely <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">a lack of challenge</a></strong> for veteran players, Wilds still isn't selling at the rate Capcom would hope.</p>



<p>That's not to say it has sold poorly. Its massive launch helped make it one of the best-selling games in 2025, but according to the company's latest financial results, Wilds is actually <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-pretty-damning-lapsed-players-may-not-be-coming-back-to-monster-hunter-wilds-after-all-as-monster-hunter-rise-continues-to-outsell-the-game/">selling less than its predecessor</a></strong>, <strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong>. That fact really puts into context why producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>Yuya Tokuda</strong> was pleading with players</a> who put the game down shortly after launch to return.</p>



<p>Of course, this coming expansion could be the thing to turn everything around for Wilds. It wouldn't be the first time a Monster Hunter game was sent into the stratosphere because of an expansion that completely changed the makeup of the game. </p>



<p>If you're a player who put down Monster Hunter Wilds shortly after launch for one reason or another, let us know below what it would take to get you to return.</p>
