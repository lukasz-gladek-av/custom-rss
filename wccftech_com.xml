			<p>Just as things were starting to look up for <strong>Bungie</strong>, with some positive buzz building around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/">Marathon</a></strong> as we inch closer to the new extraction shooter's arrival, the tides take a turn for the worse once again. In a statement shared on its social media channels, the studio has announced that the next major update for <strong>Destiny 2</strong>, the upcoming <strong>Shadow and Order</strong> update, which was supposed to be out on <strong>March 3, 2026,</strong> has been <strong>delayed by</strong> <strong>three months</strong> and will now arrive on <strong>June 9, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>A lack of promotional marketing for the update this close to its initially intended release already had players suspecting a delay would be announced, alongside the fact that the update would have been out just days ahead of Marathon, which arrives on March 5, 2026. Bungie fans and anyone who wanted to try out Marathon would have also just finished playing it for a whole weekend during its server slam test, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">which runs from February 26 to March 2</a>.</p>



<p>Instead of squeezing in the launch of a new update and a new game into one week, the Shadow and Order update will now arrive a little more than three months after its initial date. To make matters worse, if the delay time didn't raise concerns about the state of the update, Bungie's statement surely will, as the delay isn't to give Marathon more space to breathe or give the studio time to fix a significant bug they've recently discovered. It's to give the update <strong>"<em>large revisions</em>,"</strong> including changing the title of the update and give the team time to bring <em>"sizable</em>" quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>"<em>Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is <strong>undergoing large revisions and will be delayed</strong>,</em>" Bungie begins in its statement. "<em>This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will <strong>also be renamed</strong>. This update will now launch on <strong>June 9, 2026</strong>. We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April)."</em></p>

<p>Of course, the changes being made to this update could, and likely will, ultimately be for the better. But announcing such major changes this close to release, for something that is not the game's next big expansion, and just a mid-season update, clearly points to there having been not just one, but several mishaps along the way. Delays and changes like this are rarely due to just one thing going wrong, and it doesn't inspire confidence in Destiny fans who now have to wait months for an update they thought they'd get to check out in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Especially after its last major update, which was the arrival of its Star Wars-themed <strong>Renegades</strong> expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-renegades-out-now-steam-concurrent-player-count-rises/">failed to revitalize the player base</a>. Hopefully, when Bungie is ready to talk about the update closer to release, it'll have been worth the wait.</p>

			<p>After having been away from <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></em></strong> since defeating <strong>Mizutsune</strong> in the game's first major update, I returned to the latest entry in the series this week with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1-041-00-00-full-patch-notes-cpu-gpu-load/">Update 1.041.00.00</a></strong>, finding a very different experience. While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/"><strong>performance improvements</strong></a> introduced in the last couple of patches have made the game run significantly better on my PC, it's the staggering amount of new content that impressed me the most. With a new endgame grind for <strong>Talismans</strong> and a host of new monsters, I expect to continue playing until the launch of the <strong>Master Rank expansion</strong>.</p>



<p>While I looked at the mountain ahead of me, represented by the ultra-difficult <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Proof of a Hero</strong> quest, which involves defeating all four <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Arch-tempered</strong> variants of the Apex monsters, however, I didn't expect to discover that <strong>even more challenges could be on the way</strong>.</p>



<p>Over on the <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/"><em>Monster Hunter Leaks</em> subreddit</a></strong>, user <strong>Lener30</strong> posted findings after digging into the update's files. Interestingly, <strong>Tempered</strong> variants of <strong>Gogmazios</strong> and <strong>Zo Shia</strong> appear to be in the works. For the former, a <strong>LegendaryParam</strong> file has been added, strongly hinting that this variant of the monster is indeed coming. For <strong>Zo Shia</strong>, while the update does not mention the monster by name, plenty of its moves have seen changes in its own <strong>LegendaryParam</strong> file, which will likely make this new variant of the base game’s final boss significantly<strong> more challenging.</strong></p>



<p>Besides the upcoming content, the latest update adds more fuel to the fire regarding a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/think-monster-hunter-wilds-on-nintendo-switch-2-will-be-an-impossible-port-new-screenshot-and-information-suggest-otherwise/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</em> port</strong></a>. While text references to the system have been scrubbed, the update files still hide a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tutorial image for Local Communication</strong> play that clearly depicts <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</em></strong> systems. At this point, it seems a matter of when, not if, the game is announced for Nintendo's next-gen hardware. Launching in a complete state with proper optimization will definitely help the game's popularity, which was initially hindered by technical and low challenge issues.</p>



<p>Will the updates released so far be enough to bring back lapsed players, as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Game Director Yuya Tokuda pleaded last year?</strong></a> I believe they will. This isn't just an opinion based on my positive experience since yesterday: hard facts support it. The game's latest reviews on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam</a></strong> are now <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Mostly Positive (72%)</strong>, a considerable improvement over the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Mixed</strong> status they held for a long time.</p>
