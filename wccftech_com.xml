			<p>At CES 2025, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyxXRXDtcPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Bryan Catanzaro, VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, about the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> and&nbsp;its many improvements to Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Catanzaro talked about the new transformer models that are replacing CNN (convolutional neural networks) for Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction. These are simply much smarter, can be trained on larger datasets and make better choices as a result, improving historic NVIDIA DLSS shortcomings like shimmering or ghosting. The new Super Resolution model, for instance, has four times more compute compared to the previous one. Catanzaro didn't provide an estimate on how much more rendering time it will cost, but he did say NVIDIA believes it's the best way to play on the new Blackwell-powered GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards that are launching later this month.</p>
<p>Frame Generation is also being overhauled, abandoning the previous model based on the Optical Flow hardware accelerator for an entirely AI-powered solution. Here's why NVIDIA is doing that:</p>
<p><em>When we built NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, we absolutely needed hardware acceleration to compute Optical Flow. We didn't have enough Tensor Cores and we didn't have an Optical Flow algorithm that was good enough. We hadn't developed a real-time Optical Flow algorithm that ran on Tensor Cores that could fit our compute budget. We had the Optical Flow accelerator, which NVIDIA had been building for years as an evolution of our video encoder technology, and it's also been a part of our automotive computer vision acceleration for self-driving cars.</em></p>
<p><em>It made sense for us to use that for NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation. But the difficult part about any sort of hardware implementation of an algorithm like Optical Flow is that it's really difficult to improve it. It is kind of what it is and the failures that arose from that hardware Optical Flow, we couldn't undo them with a smarter neural network until we decided to just replace it and go with a fully AI-based solution, so that's what we've done for Frame Generation in DLSS 4.</em></p>
<p>The new Frame Generation model is heavier on Tensor Cores, but it uses less VRAM, offers improved image quality (which Catanzaro deemed critical, especially for the new Multi Frame Generation available on the new RTX 50 GPUs), and is also more efficient as the cost has been amortized over multiple frames.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DF's Alex Battaglia asked then whether the new model could be ported to older hardware like the GeForce RTX 30 Series, and the head of NVIDIA DLSS didn't close that door.</p>
<p><em>I think this is primarily a question of optimization and also engineering and then the ultimate user experience. We're launching this Frame Generation, the best Multi Frame Generation technology, with the 50 Series, and we'll see what we're able to squeeze out of older hardware in the future.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, when NVIDIA introduced Frame Generation with the GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards, Catanzaro himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-engineer-says-dlss-3-on-older-rtx-gpus-could-theoretically-happen-teases-rtx-i-o-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that the feature was exclusive to then-new GPUs because they had a much improved Optical Flow hardware accelerator than the RTX 30 Series. Back then, he also said it was theoretically possible to port it to older hardware, although it probably wouldn't be as beneficial.</p>
<p>With the new model removing the Optical Flow hardware accelerator, it seems like the door might be open for that to happen. However, Catanzaro also said the Tensor Core requirements are higher, and obviously, the older GPU architecture has worse Tensor Core performance. We'll see if NVIDIA can really make it happen.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Bryan Catanzaro highlighted the importance of decoupling the updated flip metering from the CPU to reduce frame time variability (and, therefore, improve frame pacing) by a factor of five to ten compared to before. Last but not least, he claimed that playing a game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflex 2</a> (which is also AI-based) feels much more 'connected' and he believes that especially latency-sensitive gamers will love it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more NVIDIA DLSS 4 coverage on Wccftech as we get closer to the launch of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>

			<p>2025 is going to see a lot of massive releases across a multitude of genres. Narrowing it down to the sports and racing games in particular, there are a fair few games that are going to be released this year that will be major hits for petrolheads and sports fans. If you want to know what games you should be putting on your calendar this year, make sure to keep reading for Wccftech's most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>

<h2>Assetto Corsa EVO (Out Now on PC via Steam)</h2>
<p>Assetto Corsa is a very popular racing game franchise, and the latest iteration has just been released, albeit on early access. There isn't a date set yet for when Assetto Corsa EVO is going to be on consoles just yet, so those on console will have to wait a little bit longer for this hyperrealistic racing game. What we do know is that Assetto Corsa EVO is set to have its full launch between September and December. The game will feature extensive modding support, as well as consistent updates to keep the game fresh once it has experienced its full launch, when it will include 100 cars and 15 officially licensed circuits (with 5 more tracks following afterward as free updates). Before that, KUNOS <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will add an open world map sometime this Summer</a>.</p>
<p>If you jump in right now, though, you'll already find 20 cars from several classes and 5 circuits across the continents: Laguna Seca (America), Brands Hatch and Imola (Europe), Mount Panorama (Australia), and Suzuka (Japan). When it comes to modes, the early access launch build features Practice sessions, Quick Races, the brand new Driving Academy, and the Hotstint and Test Drive special events.</p>

<h2>WWE 2K25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>WWE is a popular franchise that helps boost profits for both Take-Two Interactive. This game was mentioned during the earnings call, where they mentioned both the potential release of PGA Tour 2K25 and, of course, WWE 2K25. Since 2000, WWE has received a new game every year except for 2021, where there was no game released at all. Since then, it's gone back to regular scheduling, and it's likely that WWE 2K25 will be released this year. It doesn't have a set release date as of yet, but it was mentioned in the earnings call that the game will be released before March 31, 2025. This would make sense, as the past three WWE games (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-improved WWE 2K24</a>) were all released in early March.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>iRacing NASCAR 25 (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>It's been a long time coming, but NASCAR fans are finally getting a new game in the franchise. It's been three years since the last iteration aside from NASCAR 21: Ignition, but most people don't count that as an actual game in the series. iRacing NASCAR 25 was first heard of in 2023, when iRacing purchased the NASCAR license from Motorsport Games. This game will be built in Unreal Engine alongside Monster Games and is currently planned to launch on consoles, while a PC release is still up in the air.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maxresdefault-14-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (TBA - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>This game was first showcased at The Game Awards 2024, where Sega released a trailer for this upcoming game. The release date is currently unknown, but it is set to debut "soon." All we know is that the developers have promised a distinct racing mechanic that will 'transport Sonic racing fans into a new dimension.'</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be available across all platforms (including Nintendo's) and, like its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/team-sonic-racing-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Sonic Racing</a>, could be the perfect game to get youngsters into gaming and engage in some friendly competition.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wreckfest_2_Keyart-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Wreckfest 2 (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole sports and racing games genre, there isn't anything quite like Wreckfest. The spiritual successor to FlatOut <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-announced-with-new-car-customization-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returns in 2025</a> after 2018's first installment. We don't know a lot about it yet, although Finnish developer Bugbear Entertainment has promised improved destruction thanks to the more accurate physics engine and better sounds, with the latter being boasted as among the best in a racing title. So far, the main new feature is the ability to customize your vehicle. More info will undoubtedly be shared ahead of the launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvel-snap-is-down-in-the-us-following-tiktok-ban-but-devs-are-working-to-restore-service/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The extremely popular collectible card game Marvel Snap suddenly became inaccessible to United States users <a href="https://wccftech.com/tiktok-officially-banned-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the TikTok ban</a> due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). Here's the message that greets anyone who tries to log in (also available <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social channels</a>):</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable on U.S. stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, MARVEL SNAP was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18th.</em></p>
<p><em>MARVEL SNAP isn't going anywhere. We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.</em></p>
<p>The reason is pretty straightforward: TikTok creator ByteDance owns Nuverse, the publisher of the game. All apps owned by ByteDance were banned, including Marvel Snap. However, since the game itself isn't related to TikTok at all, there may be enough wiggle room for them to restore service.</p>
<p>Developed by Second Dinner, the free-to-play game launched in October 2022 for Windows PC, Android, and iOS devices. It featured over 170 Marvel characters on release, and the roster has greatly increased over time due to weekly additions.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Marvel Snap isn't too complicated. Each player has a deck of 12 cards, each one representing a Marvel character with a cost, power level, and possibly a special ability. At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously place one or more cards face down in one of three locations. The locations are randomly assigned for each game, and each location has a unique associated effect. At the end of each round, the cards are revealed and their special abilities are triggered. Whoever has the highest power in a given location wins that location; the goal is to win two of the three locations.</p>
<p>Its relative simplicity won over many fans. Last we heard, Marvel Snap had over 22 million players and has earned more than $200 million in revenue since launch.</p>
