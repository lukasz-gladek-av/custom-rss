			<p>Activision has debuted a first look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Zombies with a new cinematic trailer that introduces the cast of characters for the narrative this year, ahead of more to come with Call of Duty Next at the end of the month.</p>



<p>As it's a cinematic trailer, there's no gameplay, but it does showcase the Ashes of the Damned map somewhat, and shows how all eight characters come face to face for the first time.</p>

<p>A new blog post on the Call of Duty website goes into more detail with the new expanded crew, with backgrounds on Grigori Weaver, Dr. Elizabeth Grey, Major Mackenzie Carver, Maya Aguinaldo, Tank Dempsey, Takeo Masaki, Nikolai Belinski, and Dr. Edward Richtofen.</p>



<p>Call of Duty Next arrives in two weeks on September 30, and ahead of that, another blog post will reveal more about Zombies, which is arriving alongside the rest of Black Ops 7 this coming November 14, 2025.</p>



<p>In other Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 news, Activision acknowledged cries from players that Call of Duty is having an <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">"<em>identity crisis</em>,"</a> and confirmed that skins and weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward to Black Ops 7.</p>
