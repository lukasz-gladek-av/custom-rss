			<p>Just weeks after Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">unveiled its new subsidiary with Tencent to be Vantage Studios</a>, which will house the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises, and be co-led by Charlie Guillemot (son of Yves Guillemot, chief executive officer at Ubisoft) and Christophe Derennes, the current head of the Assassin's Creed series, Marc-Alexis Côté has left Ubisoft.</p>



<p>This news was first reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">IGN</a>, which reports that staff were alerted to Côté's departure today through an internal email that also included details regarding "<em>the need for Vantage Studios' leadership team to be aligned with its core goals</em>." The report adds that Côté was offered a role within Vantage Studios, but declined to take it.</p>



<p>The report also included a statement attributed to a Ubisoft spokesperson (which Ubisoft also sent to Wccftech, confirming Côté's departure), which reads, "<em>Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté</em> <em>has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we're confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis Côté</em> <em>has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin's Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavours.</em>"</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté had been with Ubisoft for 20 years and first began working on the Assassin's Creed franchise in 2009. Since then, he's been a part of the series every step of the way, from the conceptual beginnings of each title to its execution. He's worked on the series as a level designer, game director, creative director, and since March 2022, he's overseen the development of the entire franchise. </p>



<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for further clarification on the nature of the roles Marc-Alexis Côté was offered, and if he would have been able to be in a similar position at the head of the Assassin's Creed franchise, had he accepted. We'll update this story if/when we hear back.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already playable on PC and Android devices via emulators like EDEN.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">tabeneru</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases">EDEN emulator</a> can run the new entry in the popular series launching this week worldwide on PC and even Android devices rather well with the appropriate settings. </p>



<p>On PC, users don't even need a high-end system to run the game at the native 30FPS cap, as the user's system, powered by an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU, which is far from being the fastest system configuration, has no trouble running the game smoothly, at least in the shown segment. However, a high-end system is required to push the emulated Switch release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A past its resolution and framerate cap on PC with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SLbqzH04M&amp;t=2s">the first mod that allows up to 4K at 60 FPS gameplay</a> shared by Youtube user FRANC225. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Pokémon Legends: Z-A has yet to officially release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leak-online-early-builds-pokedex-more/">early copies of the game already reached the hands of players</a>, so it's not surprising to see the game already emulated on PC. However, this ability to emulate new titles may soon change. As development shifts to the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusively, it is widely expected that it will take a long time before an effective emulator for the new console becomes available on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows hasn't officially been announced for the Nintendo Switch 2, but we've seen multiple rumours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-ports/">even dating back to August 2024</a>, that the game would arrive on Nintendo's new console. After the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/">was rated by PEGI earlier this year</a>, it seemed like a lock that an announcement would arrive soon, likely at the next Nintendo Direct event.</p>



<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">multiple chances for the game to show up at a Nintendo Direct</a> event since the rating went live, and still we've heard nothing, but a <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/assassins-creed-shadows-debarquera-bientot-sur-switch-2-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-60629">new report from Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> seems to have told us both when the game will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 and when we'll hear about it.</p>



<p>According to the report, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will be officially announced at some point before November 7, 2025, while the actual release date of the new version is expected to be December 5, 2025. Dealabs also reports that it expects the new version to be priced at "<em>around € 50</em>."</p>



<p>If Shadows arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 before the end of the year, then it'll be the second major Ubisoft title to make its way to the device after Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">which was actually a pleasant surprise in terms of its performance</a>. Hopefully, Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlKCBGzrB1I">follows in those footsteps</a>, and we're able to see the Nintendo Switch 2 continue to punch above its weight class and keep up, as best it can, with current-generation releases.</p>



<p>Its arrival in December would also technically make it the first 'new release' for the Assassin's Creed series under <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's new subsidiary with Tencent, Vantage Studios</a>. </p>



<p>For more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">you can check out our review from its initial release in March</a>, where Francesco De Meo gave the game an 8.7/10, saying, "<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em>" </p>
