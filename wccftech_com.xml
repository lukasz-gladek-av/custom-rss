			<p>Avowed, the latest roleplaying game by Obsidian Entertainment and the first they published under Xbox Game Studios, has been officially out for three days. The first real data on player concurrency will come in this weekend, as the game will presumably reach a new peak on Steam, but in the meantime, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a tidbit as part of their interview with Game Director Carrie Patel: Obsidian is happy with sales so far.</p>
<p>In the conversation with Bloomberg, Patel went over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-has-had-a-reboot-of-sorts-and-may-be-further-away-than-anticipated-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reboot</a> that happened in 2021, when she took over from the prior director.</p>
<p><em>I feel like I've learned so much over the past four years that I wish I'd known at the start of this process. It's definitely been a job where the highs are really high and the lows are really low. Normally, if you're stepping back and reevaluating your creative direction, putting together a new vertical slice and revised production plans, you would do that with a very small team. We did not have a very small team at that point. A lot of lessons we learned as we were building Avowed, ideally we would've learned on a small scale with a true preproduction.</em></p>
<p>One of the biggest changes brought by the reboot was downsizing from a Skyrim-like open world to something more akin to the studio's previous productions. On this subject, Patel said:</p>
<p><em>With any game, you think, 'Ok, we can't climb every mountain - which ones are really worth the effort for us? We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with 'open zones', and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player's going from one environment to the next.</em></p>
<p>Patel also ended with a seemingly hopeful sentence about potential sequels for Avowed:</p>
<p><em>Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it.</em></p>
<p>She previously worked on Pillars of Eternity, so it's likely she was referring not generally to the world of Eora but specifically to this action version rather than those cRPGs. Of course, whether she gets her wish will mostly depend on Microsoft's assessment of the sales and overall reception.</p>

As a reminder, Obsidian is also working with a separate team on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is slated to launch late this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>NetEase made waves in all the wrong ways when it decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lay off developers</a> at its Western Marvel Rivals studio despite the fact that the game was an absolute smash hit with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 40 million players to date</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a fresh report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Bloomberg</a> alleges that the Chinese company suffered many abrupt changes mandated by its founder and CEO, William Ding, who cut hundreds of jobs and suddenly pulled back its massive foreign investment. As a reminder, over the last few years, NetEase has invested in many studios based in North America, Europe, and Japan, such as:</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/behaviour-interactive-receives-strategic-investment-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behaviour Interactive</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/suda-grasshopper-manufacture-has-joined-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture (wholly owned)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nagoshi Studio (wholly owned)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-has-been-acquired-by-netease-games-for-100-million-euros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantic Dream (wholly owned)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebel Wolves</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-minecraft-studio-skybox-labs-netease-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skybox Labs (wholly owned)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-devs-defect-found-jar-of-sparks-new-studio-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jar of Sparks (founded by former Halo and Destiny veteran Jerry Hook)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-for-pc-console-in-development-at-jackalyptic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackalyptic Games (founded by former MMO veteran Jack Emmert)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-entertainment-is-a-new-netease-studio-founded-by-bioware-bethesda-mmo-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-Minus Zero (founded by former BioWare and Bethesda veterans)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Untold (founded by former Mass Effect lead Mac Walters)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-wow-designer-founds-new-netease-studio-making-an-aaa-fantasy-mmo-codenamed-ghost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fantastic Pixel Castle (founded by former World of Warcraft veteran Greg Street)</a></p>
<p>Of these, Jar of Sparks and Worlds Untold already had their funding cut by NetEase a few months ago, and the heads are now desperately looking for another publisher and source of funding. Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was also shut down</a> despite the game's launch to positive reviews. And now, other Japanese studios like Nagoshi's have just been given the time required to complete current projects. There won't be any additional funding or time allotted by NetEase, and the Chinese publisher has no plans to spend any money on marketing or promoting the games currently in production in Japan.</p>
<p>Other NetEase-backed Western studios on that list are also reportedly seeking new publishers, including Jackalyptic, which is making a Warhammer MMORPG (which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to Jack Emmert</a> about after its announcement). This game was recently shown at a trade event to partners and received a positive response, so there's hope it will find a new home.</p>
