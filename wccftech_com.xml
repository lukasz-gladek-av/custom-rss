			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Xbox confirmed its lineup</a> for what it will feature during Gamescom 2025, with over 20 games on the list, and that its recently announced upcoming handheld, the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, will be available for players at the show to go hands-on with. Today, notable and reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-vous-devoile-la-date-douverture-des-ventes-60300">Billbil-kun from Dealabs</a> reports that pre-orders for both handhelds will go live the same day that Gamescom 2025 kicks-off, on August 20, 2025.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also corroborated previous reports around the pricing for both handhelds, saying that the previous report of the ROG Xbox Ally being €599 and the ROG Xbox Ally X being €899 are correct, though Billbil-kun is not able to confirm the official pricing for the US and other regions around the world.</p>



<p>We know that Xbox will be featuring the Xbox Ally during its two days of broadcasts on Wednesday, August 20, and Thursday, August 21, so it could be that the official regional pricing and pre-orders will go live during that broadcast. Though it's also just as likely that the official prices will be revealed during <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom 2025 ONL</a> the night before, on August 19, to get players ready for the pre-orders to go live on August 20.</p>



<p>And if the official pricing is revealed on the 19th with pre-orders live on the 20th, then it's fairly safe to assume we'll know the official release date of the handheld on the 19th.</p>



<p>Regardless of when pre-orders go live or when the Xbox Ally launches, some players are using Dealabs' report to claim that August 20 is also when we'll know the release date for Hollow Knight Silksong. When the ROG Xbox Ally was revealed, it featured Silksong playing on the device, and when Xbox revealed its Gamescom 2025 lineup yesterday, it highlighted that there will be a playable demo of Silksong at its booth, which players can try out on the Xbox Ally.</p>



<p>The logic then seems to be that Xbox plans to have its new handheld out after Silksong has finally released, so it can be playable on the Xbox Ally on day one. Gamescom ONL is also the last major show of announcements before The Game Awards at the end of the year, and by then, it's expected that Silksong will have launched.</p>



<p>We'll see what surprises Gamescom 2025 has in store.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 29/07/2025:</strong> It appears to have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mcaanu/possible_footage_of_bmwukong_dlc/">confirmed</a> that this video is not a real leak of Black Myth: Wukong DLC and is indeed just some impressive work from a fan. </p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>A video from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th2bp9e0QUQ">DonPablo Gaming</a> claims to be footage from an unannounced DLC for Black Myth: Wukong, featuring a new underwater region and a quick-time-event fight between the game's protagonist, The Destined One, fighting what looks like a hydra on the back of a dragon. The video's description also claims that more details, like when this DLC will be available, will be announced on August 20, 2025, the day that Gamescom 2025 kicks off and the day <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong comes to Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>



<p>Last year, rumors circulated that Black Myth: Wukong was set to receive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/">two DLC expansions</a> ahead of a sequel, with the first of those DLCs planned for 2025. After the game surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/">18 million copies sold</a> (and would later <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/">surpass 20 million</a>), Daniel Wu from Hero Games, the largest external shareholder for the game's developer, Game Science, confirmed that an expansion was in development. </p>



<p>But beyond that, we've not had any other official or even close to official word on any DLC.</p>

<p>Which is why it's still worth taking this video with a grain of salt, even though, through all its pixelated features, it does appear like it has a chance of being real. Especially since the video does capture the kind of grandiose encounters the original game is known for. The uploader also claims in the comments of the video that the footage is pulled from a beta test version of the DLC. </p>



<p>Is there a chance that this video is real? Sure there is. Is there a chance that someone is showing off their talents at faking this kind of footage? Always. We'll know one way or another by August 20th.</p>
