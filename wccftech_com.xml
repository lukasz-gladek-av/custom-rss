<p>Following the release of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Maiden of Black Water</em> in 2015, the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame</em> series returned in 2021 with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/project-zero-maiden-of-black-water-2021-review/">a remake of the Wii U exclusive</a></strong> followed by a remake of <strong><em>Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</em> in 2023</strong>, which made it possible for many to get acquainted with this unique survival-horror series for the first time. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">With no new entry in the series on the horizon</strong>, it will be up to another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remake</strong>,<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>, to bring the series again to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">modern hardware </strong>this March.</p>

<p>For those not in the know, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> not the first remake of the second entry in the series</strong>, which originally launched on PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2003/2004. In 2012, the game made the jump to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Wii</strong>, blossoming from its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fixed-camera</strong> state reminiscent of the first few Resident Evil and Silent Hill games into an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">over-the-shoulder third-person</strong> game blended with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">motion controls</strong> via the Wii Remote that suited the Camera Obscura mechanics well. The<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> enhanced visuals</strong> also served the experience quite well, making it way more eerie and immersive.</p>



<p><em>Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> is another enhancement of the experience, with <strong>modern visuals</strong> powered by the Katana engine for an even more immersive experience, and <strong>plenty of quality-of-life improvements</strong> to enhance gameplay to the highest possible degree. <strong>Having only played the original PlayStation 2 release</strong> once back in the day, it is impossible for me to judge <strong>how an early build of the remake I had the chance to try compares to the Wii Edition</strong>. <span>What I can say, however, </span>is that this remake, which sits between innovation and tradition, is set to deliver&nbsp;a <strong>very engaging experience</strong>, if one can look past a combat system that does feel more frustrating than fun, at least in the beginning of the game.</p>

Like in the original, the player's choices will shape the siblings' destiny among different possibilities, offering <strong>great replayability</strong></p>



<p>While I only <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">experienced the recreation of the first four chapters in the game</strong>, I couldn't help but remember how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gripping</strong> Fatal Frame 2 can be from the start. The combination of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> cutscenes and environmental storytelling</strong>, which relies heavily on finding documents scattered throughout the village, has only become more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">powerfu</strong>l in the remake thanks to enhanced visuals that bring Minakami Village to life like never before. Some of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">pre-rendered cutscenes</strong> focusing on past events do seem to be a simple upscale of those of the Wii Edition cutscenes as they feature some rather simple character models that starkly contrast with the high-quality new models, but they do not detract much from immersion, being often very filtered.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260203180008_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The visual improvements of Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Buttefly Remake over the previous versions of the game are considerable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Focused on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">offering players a chance to experience <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</em> for the first time</strong>, it's not surprising to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">traditional gameplay feels</strong>. Besides featuring the aforementioned <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">documents and journals</strong> scattered around providing additional details on the world and lore, the remake of the second entry in the series features <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">every staple of the survival horror genre</strong> since its establishment: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">moderately intricate level design</strong> with multiple paths, locked doors requiring keys, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">limited resources</strong> upon which the survival aspect is based, and <strong>a stalker enemy</strong> that cannot be defeated. The first few chapters of the game are not <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">very challenging</strong> at Normal difficulty, so those who have never played an entry in the series before will have <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">enough time</strong> to adjust to some of the quirks of the experience</p>



<p>The one element that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">distinguishes</strong> the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame</em> series from every other survival-horror series is the aforementioned <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Camera Obscura</strong> camera, which remains a core element in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>. With this mysterious camera, Mio can fight hostile ghosts and be guided to the next story objective by more friendly ones.</p>



<p>The game's entire <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">combat system</strong> is centered on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Camera Obscura</strong>, requiring players to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">take the best pictures of ghosts</strong> to defeat them. <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">With&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">different film types</strong>&nbsp;coming with different attack power and reload speed,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">special shots</strong>&nbsp;are possible with any of the four available filters (which must often be used to progress in the story as well) that can blind or slow ghosts, and mechanics that the game's combat system can get rather&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tactical</strong>.</span> However, t<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">he in-game tutorials don't offer anything beyond a rough explanation of the combat mechanics</strong>, which can lead to frustration. </p>



<p>Thankfully, the remake features a proper <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">dodge maneuver</strong> whose addition is quite welcome, as the game wants the player to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">take pictures of ghosts as they are about to attack</strong> for maximum efficacy, thus alleviating some of the combat frustrations. An <strong>upgrade system</strong> for the Camera Obscura and its filters can also make a huge difference, so, at the very least,<strong> the remake offers tools</strong> to make combat slightly faster and less frustrating. Those looking to enjoy the game's story with minimal challenge can play it on<strong> Easy mode</strong>, which I expect will be popular among newcomers to the series.</p>

<p>Although I am not too fond of the game's combat, <em>Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> delivers an <strong>immediately engaging survival-horror experience</strong>. As such, I am really looking forward to continuing the game and <strong>deciding the fate of Mio and Mayu</strong> when the game launches on <strong>March 12</strong> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
