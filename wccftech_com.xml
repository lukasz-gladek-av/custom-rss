			<p>Data mining may have leaked the Nintendo Switch 2's computing power in teraflops. <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-3950#post-1544590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Famiboards user Zachy</a>, the undocked or handheld mode will have a GPU clock speed of 561 MHz, translating into 1.71 TFLOPS. In docked mode, the GPU clock speed nearly doubles at 1000 Mhz, translating to around 3.1 TFLOPS.</p>
<p>That's one-fourth of the 12 TFLOPS of the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, which launched in 2021. However, the RTX 3060 is a desktop GPU, so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. A better comparison is Microsoft's Xbox Series S console. It has been said that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, and indeed, the leaked TFLOPS data supports that theory since the Series S has 4 TFLOPS of computing power. That's not a big difference, though, and third-party game developers will undoubtedly use their Xbox Series S configurations as starting targets for their ports to the new Nintendo console.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's Tegra 239 SoC&nbsp;</a>(featuring an eight-core CPU and an Ampere-based GPU with 2048 CUDA cores), does have an advantage over the Xbox Series S: its reported native support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction technology. While the latter may not prove to be very useful as developers wouldn't want to spend the meager GPU power on ray tracing effects, DLSS SR will indeed be invaluable to uplift the performance to acceptable standards.</p>
<p>New leaks and rumors about the new Nintendo console pop up nearly daily at this point. The Japanese game developer and console manufacturer has promised it will unveil the hardware (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to include backward compatibility with existing Switch games, providing immediate access to a very large library) before the end of March, which is when Nintendo's fiscal year ends.</p>

			<p>The announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> at CES 2025 doesn't mean earlier versions of the Deep Learning Super Sampling upscaler aren't still being used. Today, NVIDIA provided an update on some PC games that are about to get support for DLSS Super Resolution (2.0), Frame Generation (3.0), and/or DLAA.</p>
<p>Both NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation are available in Tankhead, a roguelite vehicle shooter released last month on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tankhead-2f3b51" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. In this game, players become Whitaker, the pilot of a drone-controlled Light Tank that can move quickly and deliver devastating damage with various weapons. The ultimate goal is traversing the Event Containment Area, where humans cannot survive, to reach the so-called Highpoint.</p>
<p>Starting today, DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex are also available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-2-is-a-next-generation-action-moba-made-with-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMITE 2</a>. Following the end of the Closed Alpha stage, the Unreal Engine 5 powered third-person action MOBA game <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-2-gets-open-beta-launch-adding-three-new-modes-five-new-gods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has entered the Open Beta</a> and is officially free to play on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, as well as Sony's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X consoles. Developer Hi-Rez Studios has added five new gods with this update: Aladdin from Arabian myth, the Egyptian God of Earth Geb, the Chinese Ascendant Warrior Mulan, Agni from the Hindu Pantheon, and Ullr from the Norse Pantheon.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, HoYoverse will release update 3.0 for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/honkai-star-rail-trails-of-mediocrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, MiHoYo's free-to-play science fantasy gacha game. The patch will add the new world of Amphoreus and a fresh chapter in the game's main story and introduce NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to the PC version, increasing frame rates for GeForce RTX users.</p>
<p>Italian developer KUNOS Simulazioni will release the highly anticipated racing simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-set-to-release-on-steam-january-16-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> on early access in two days, on Thursday, January 16. The game features a vastly improved proprietary engine that supports a full 24-hour race cycle, advanced lighting, dynamic weather, and track conditions. It also supports VR and triple-screen Surround setups for maximum immersion. In both cases, users will be glad to know the game supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution on day one as a frame rate booster.</p>
<p>The studio also shared the official system requirements. You can find them below.</p>
