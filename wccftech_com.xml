			<p>Across all 14 chapters of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, there are 103 notes you can find and read that add more context to the story and the individual events each chapter focuses on.</p>
<p>South of Midnight's story is where the game shines brightest, so it's worth your time to go out and look for all of them in each chapter.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 4</h2>
<p>Chapter 4 is a lot simpler than some of the other chapters, since there's only three notes to find here.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Grocery List</strong> - After clearing the first combat encounter of the level, you'll hit a lamppost on the path, as you hear Hazel talk about getting closer to the church. Go left at the lamppost, Strand Push the branches in your path and then go left again when you see the small house. Use your newly acquired grapple to hook around the back of the house you just saw, where a Floof knot and a note on top of a barrel await you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lay Off Buddy</strong> - Once you've grabbed the previous note, before leaving this area entirely, head inside the house you veered left at, and you'll find another Floof knot, with this note on the bed.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Lord's Day</strong> - Once you've made it to where the church sits, before heading up to it, cut straight across the cemetery in front of you, and jump over the wooden fences. Look to the back right corner of the cemetery where you'll find a hollowed tree, and this note inside.</p>
<p>That's all the notes in Chapter 4. If you've been following along with these guides, you'll have found 17 out of 103 by now. Only 86 more to go.</p>

			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-cancels-game-and-lays-off-a-few-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceling a new game</a> and laying off employees in October 2024, Spanish developer Tequila Works closed down around a month later due to insolvency. Now, the Spanish website Escrapalia has <a href="https://www.escrapalia.com/en/event/evento-de-subasta-activos-intangibles-de-tequila-works-s-l-202503311113069684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the auction details for the brand itself and all of its assets.</p>
<p><em>The auction comprises the following assets grouped into 9 lots, classified according to their nature and stage of development.</em></p>
<p><em>Bundles included in the event:</em><br>
<em>Video games published with consolidated intellectual property:</em><br>
<em>Deadlight</em><br>
<em>Rime</em><br>
<em>GYLT</em><br>
<em>The Invisible Hours</em><br>
<em>Video games in development (with vertical slice available):</em><br>
<em>Brawler Crawler</em><br>
<em>Dungeon Tour</em><br>
<em>The Ancient Mariner</em><br>
<em>Ideas Tequila Works</em><br>
<em>Corporate Identity Assets:</em><br>
<em>"Tequila Works" Brand</em></p>
<p><em>The assets will be transferred under the exclusive account and risk of the successful bidder and are subject to the specific contractual conditions detailed in each lot sheet. The technical, legal and commercial documentation will be available in a digital data room accessible upon signature of NDAs.</em></p>
<p>Bids have already started, with RiME and GYLT already at €15.5K after 150 bids each. Bidding will go on until May 14. The former was by far the most critically acclaimed of the games released by the Spanish studio throughout its 15-year history. Back then, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a 9 out of 10 score</a> from Wccftech reviewer Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>RiME does great what it sets out to do: provide an emotional and engaging experience that very few players will be able to forget. As with similar games, however, the Tequila Works developed adventure is not a game for everyone: it is a journey of mystery and self-discovery, a journey that's supposed to make players think, and not only about the puzzles. Those looking for enemies to defeat around every corner will probably end up being disappointed.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>After such a long and troubled development, many feared that RiME would be a failure, but Tequila Works proved that there can be light at the end of the tunnel. With peculiar storytelling, varied puzzles, well-crafted platforming elements and gorgeous presentation, RiME can rival with the unique beauty of Team ICO's games.</em></p>
