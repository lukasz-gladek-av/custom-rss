			<p>You'll do a lot of collecting in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, including collecting the creatures you discover while roaming the four main planets you visit across the game's story. In some cases, capturing and researching these creatures is essential to your progression in the game.</p>
<p>So, how do you capture creatures? Some of the exact details for each creature change the process slightly, but the rules are mostly the same. This guide will show you how to capture creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, so you'll be prepared for anything that has the misfortune of being in your way.</p>
<h2>Revenge Of The Savage Planet - How To Capture Creatures</h2>
<p>Before we get into the how of capturing creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, you'll need to make sure you've already collected your whip. Without it, you can't capture anything. You'll also want to make sure that you're not surrounded by plenty of other creatures that will be hostile towards you.</p>
<p>Any interruption means you restart the process, so it's good to single out one creature to capture at a time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you have a creature you want to capture in your sights, the very first thing you'll want to do is scan it. Jump into scanning mode, and give it a scan, even if you've already scanned that species. The info box that will appear next to it will remind you of anything you need to be aware of when engaging and trying to capture that creature.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>What you do next will depend on the size of the creature you're trying to capture. Most creatures will require you to stun them in some way, usually by hitting a weak spot with your blaster. Others don't need that kind of preamble. You can just hold your whip button until you're swinging it over your head like a lasso. You'll be able to tell if it can be captured if a small circle appears on the creature, signifying that your whip is locked on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Once you've locked onto the creature, release your whip and you'll start a small tug-of-war mini-game with the creature. Just keep the whip button held, and so long as you're not interrupted, you'll pull the creature close enough to capture it.</li>
</ul>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/">Empty Vessel</a>, the studio founded by former id Software developers and comprised of people who've worked on Doom, The Last of Us, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Uncharted, and more, has just closed out its series A round of funding for its debut project, DEFECT, with&nbsp;<strong>$11 million</strong> total raised from this round.</p>
<p>The additional funds will allow Empty Vessel to expand the team, per a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/emptyvessel-Expands-DEFECT-Game-Development-with-Series-A-Close">press release</a>, and scale to the point where they can work on bringing DEFECT to consoles, and add support for single-player experiences on top of DEFECT already being a multiplayer-focused game.</p>
<p>When we last heard about DEFECT and Empty Vessel, it was with news that NCSOFT had made "<em>a strategic equity investment</em>" in the studio to help DEFECT get out the door, so it's no surprise that NCSOFT was one of the companies that led this series A round of funding, alongside 1AM Gaming, and Black Phoenix Games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Official Reveal Trailer (Unreal In Engine) | Wishlist Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IScUN3ZYeR8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>It's gratifying to see our developer-first approach resonating with fans and our new long-term partners at NCSOFT alongside our other investors</em>," said chief executive officer at Empty Vessel and game director on DEFECT, Emmanuel Palalic.</p>
<p>"<em>We remain committed to our vision of creating a new genre in the FPS market with DEFECT, and while we are building in a sustainable manner, this new investment will allow us to accelerate our plans for proper single-player support and to expand onto more platforms</em>."</p>
<p>For NCSOFT, the chief executive officer of NC America, and chief operating officer of NC West, Jeonghee 'JJ' Jin added "<em>Empty Vessel's distinct vision for game design, production, and player interaction made us quick believers in their upcoming shooter, DEFECT. We're committed to the evolution and future of this incredible game</em>."</p>
<p>1AM Gaming's managing director, Gregory Milken added "<em>We believe that Empty Vessel is a unique studio working on an amazing game, so we are thrilled to join them as a key investor as they work towards bringing a fresh perspective for first person shooter games with DEFECT</em>."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-details-emerge-on-upcoming-dungeons-dragons-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, a digital fantasy tabletop adventure game set in the Forgotten Realms, will be released later this year for PC, PlayStation 5, and VR (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124340/Demeo_x_Dungeons__Dragons_Battlemarked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamVR</a>, Meta Horizon, PSVR2). The news came today from developer Resolution Games, which previously made Demeo. Compared to that game, though, the D&amp;D licensed game will feature more narrative.</p>
<p>Tommy Palm, founder and CEO of Resolution Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>While the world of Demeo is rich with lore, our previous titles focus primarily on tactical action over motivation and narrative. With DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, story is just as important as combat, so we’ve rebalanced our approach to make sure we can deliver more of it. With the addition of dramatic cut scenes, richer dialogue, and deeper player choices, Battlemarked truly marks the start of the next iteration of the Demeo Action Roleplaying System.</em></p>
<p>To improve in this area, Resolution Games hired legendary story designer Matt Sernett as the project’s narrative lead. Sernett previously worked as a designer for the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS tabletop game and contributed to DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS video games such as the classics Baldur’s Gate, Baldur’s Gate II, and Icewind Dale. More recently, he contributed to the narrative of Bungie's Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Matt Sernett added:</p>
<p><em>When DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS launched the fifth edition back in 2014, the first adventure that many players went on ventured into Neverwinter Wood, and I can think of no place better for Battlemarked players to begin their journey. The first adventure in Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked will take players to familiar locations including Cragmaw Castle and Mount Hotenow. The world of D&amp;D is just as much a part of the story as its characters, and we can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in its dangers and delights.</em></p>
<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of another D&amp;D licensed game in development at Giant Skull, the new studio founded by former God of War and Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen. That game will be a single player action/adventure title.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches.1206111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Eurogamer</a>, two chief executives from Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by former Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies, who worked on each Grand Theft Auto game since GTA III, have left the company just a week before the studio's first release, MindsEye, is set to launch.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer Paul Bland quietly confirmed his departure with a quick update to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-b-b7410313/">LinkedIn page</a> that his time at Build A Rocket Boy concluded in June 2025, while chief legal officer Riley Graebner announced his departure with a short post on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn page</a>, saying "<em>After three and a half years my time at BARB has come to a close. I'm proud of what we've accomplished</em>."</p>
<p>That both of them have left just before MindsEye launches is more just the latest odd thing to be attached to MindsEye's story, than any actual reflection on what we should expect from the game on June 10.</p>
<p>But add that news to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1kt8ww4/previews_for_mindseye_by_former_rockstar_games/">less-than-enthusiastic previews </a>the game got, how little we know about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">game so close to release</a>, reports of the <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1929323838656950698">studio not giving out review codes</a>, negative reviews on the studio's internal structure from former employees on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a>, and the studio's co-chief executive officer claiming that any negative attention the game is a result of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">someone financially investing in a campaign to tarnish the studio's name</a>, and it all strikes as a bit more than odd.</p>
<p>Of course, the game could still come out next week and be amazing, but these departures are leading players in the game's official Discord server and on social media to show concern for its launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MindsEye and Everywhere have always sounded like two incredibly ambitious projects. It would be far more exciting if both games were spectacular, than if they failed to hit their mark. It's far too early to make a call on it yet, if for no other reason than none of us have played it, but it'll be interesting to see what June 10 holds either way.</p>
