			<p><strong>Warframe</strong>, the popular free-to-play action RPG from Canadian developer <strong>Digital Extremes</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-model-future-western-mmo-jack-emmert-greg-street/">that's also the MMO model that other MMO developers should be looking to</a>), is rounding out its list of available platforms by finally arriving on <strong>Android mobile devices</strong> today. That said, it's a Canada-exclusive release today, and for the coming week, before it arrives on Android devices globally on <strong>February 18, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>With Warframe being one of the most successful live-service titles to come out of Canada that's currently active, this first week of exclusivity is a way for Digital Extremes to prioritize its Canadian players and give them the first crack at a new platform before it comes to Android devices and the Google Play Store everywhere else.</p>



<p>It'll feature full crossplay support between Android, iOS, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 devices (<a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-launches-on-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-and-it-will-look-and-run-great/">when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2, that is</a>). It'll also feature full cross-platform save support, so you'll be able to pick up on Android wherever you left off on a different device.</p>



<p>As for the game's technical requirements, you'll need an Android device running <strong>64-bit Android OS 12.0 or higher on an ARM64 processo</strong>r, with a minimum of <strong>4GB of RAM</strong>.</p>



<p>If you have a device ready to go that meets all of those requirements, then you'll also be treated to Android-exclusive rewards by getting the <strong>Cumulus Collection</strong> if you sign in on Android before <strong>March 4, 2026.</strong> You'll get a special weapon and armour cosmetics, as well as resource boosters to help kick-start your time on Android.</p>



<p>This past December, Digital Extremes released yet another major expansion for Warframe, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/">The Old Peace</a></strong>, which introduced a new narrative chapter in Warframe's storyline.
