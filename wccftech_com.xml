			<p>Six years after its original release, Katana Zero remains one of the best 2D hack-and-slash one-hit-kill games on any platform. Its tightly executed gameplay and mysterious story make it extremely repayable, along with the speedrunning mode that was added to the game post-launch.</p>
<p>The DLC that developer Askiisoft announced shortly after the game's launch in 2019 has yet to come. However, during today's Triple-I Initiative Showcase, we finally got a glimpse at the DLC, along with the announcement that it'll be "<em>coming soon</em>."</p>
<p>Askiisoft also confirmed that the DLC will still be free for players who already own Katana Zero. Just as exciting is the confirmation that every new addition the DLC brings will add up to this expansion being about "<em>the size of the original game</em>."</p>
<p>The DLC will feature new characters, levels, and gameplay mechanics, and developer Askiisoft assures players in a press release that when it does arrive, this DLC will have been "<em>worth the wait.</em>"</p>

<p>Fans of Katana Zero have been waiting for answers about the base game's story, which this DLC promises to include. Understandably, Askiisoft is hesitant to provide any story insights ahead of the DLC's release. What we do know is that this DLC will pick up right where Zero's story left off in the base game, and as we see in the trailer, we'll also get a better glimpse into his past.</p>
<p>This DLC reveal was the 'one more thing' at the end of the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, which shows just how much pent-up excitement exists for the next chapter of Katana Zero's story. It's definitely still upsetting that we don't even have a release window yet, but the fact that we have an update after years of silence has definitely rekindled fans excitement, and removed any doubt that the DLC had died somewhere along the way in the last six years.</p>
