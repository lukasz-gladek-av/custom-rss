			<p>Today, Rockstar Games announced the acquisition of Sydney-based developer Video Games Deluxe. The studio was founded in 2013 by former Team Bondi founder Brendan McNamara. Since its inception, Video Games Deluxe has collaborated with Rockstar on the re-release of L.A. Noire and the 2017 VR-only game L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files. More recently, the developer has worked on improving Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games Head of Publishing Jennifer Kolbe said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia.</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara added:</p>
<p><em>It’s been an honor to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade. We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.</em></p>
<p>The acquisition price remains undisclosed. In July 2020, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/l-a-noire-creators-working-on-aaa-open-world-vr-game-for-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for an open world VR game to be made for Rockstar. However, given the complete lack of growth for virtual reality gaming, it is highly unlikely that the project is still being worked on. It is far more conceivable that the former Video Games Deluxe will bolster Rockstar's output with the upcoming massively anticipated launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, planned for this Fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-awaited free Grand Theft Auto V update</a> that's set to introduce technical improvements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>AMD FSR1 and FSR 3</li>
<li>Ray traced shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, and global illumination</li>
<li>Faster loading times using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices and configurations</li>
<li>Enhanced support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher frame rates</li>
<li>DualSense controller support, with adaptive triggers</li>
<li>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch will drop tomorrow and can already be preloaded on PC.</p>
