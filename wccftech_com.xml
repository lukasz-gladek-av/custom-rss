			<p>Today, MercurySteam has revealed the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mercurysteams-new-dark-fantasy-arpg-blades-of-fire-to-be-unveiled-this-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Blades of Fire game. From its looks, it will be a single player action/adventure in the vein of Sony Santa Monica's God of War titles. The protagonist is one Aran de Lira, the firstborn of the King's Ward. In this fantasy world, the newly crowned Queen Nerea has cast a spell that turns steel to stone. Only her army of abominations wields the divine metal against which other blades shatter.</p>
<p>As Aran, players must find forging scrolls, develop the main character's blacksmithing skills, and craft weapons to suit their favorite fighting style. The chosen weapon family and the materials used while forging it will affect characteristics such as weight, length, durability, penetration, and edge quality.</p>
<p>There are seven different weapon families in Blades of Fire, as well as over thirty unique Forge Scrolls, allowing for a great number of combinations. Picking the right weapon for the job, depending on the enemy's armor, will be critical. The developers promise a unique and challenging combat system that allows players to target specific parts of the enemy's body.</p>
<p>On his journey to liberate the land, Aran won't be alone. His companion, Adso, will be crucial to your adventure as he speaks the ancient language of the Forgers. He'll also provide helpful tips on how to defeat enemies by analyzing them and making notes in his chronicles. It sounds like players will need the info since Blades of Fire features over fifty enemy types, including the Queen's guards, creatures, undead, and more. Each enemy has its own unique attack style, weapon and armor. Throughout the story, Aran and Adso will explore epic environments, including huge castles and labyrinthine palaces.</p>
<p>505 Games president Neil Ralley said:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s pedigree for creating unique and beloved games is just one of the many reasons we’re thrilled to partner with them on Blades of Fire. Their gaming system that transforms weapons customization into an outstanding combat experience is astounding, as is their commitment to telling the best story possible. We can’t wait to share it with the world.</em></p>
<p>The good news is that the game isn't far off at all. It's set to launch on May 22 for PC (via the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game's pricing is technically $59.99, though there is a 10% pre-order discount. Additionally, pre-order customers will get two in-game armors for Aran as well as additional forging materials.</p>

			<p>Playground Games has revealed the PlayStation 5 launch date for its award-winning game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>. The latest installment in the open world racing game franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-playstation-5-in-spring-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will debut on Sony's console</a> on April 29, although owners of the Premium Edition will be able to start roaming the Mexican country roads from April 25. Playground Games also revealed the technical details of this version, including the planned improvements for the PlayStation 5 Pro console:</p>
<p><em>Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 features two rendering modes to choose from: Performance (60fps) and Quality (30fps). On PS5 Pro, the Performance mode receives increased visual fidelity, while Quality mode adds ray traced car reflections to Races and Free Roam.</em></p>
<p>The launch on PlayStation 5 coincides with a major update called Horizon Realms, which will be available on all platforms. This new feature aims to let players immerse themselves in the history of the game's Evolving World updates. In Horizon Realms, players will get to explore twelve Evolving World locations: eleven of the best previously limited-time locations and the first-ever Stadium Track.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stunt Park</li>
<li>Ice Rink</li>
<li>Oval Track</li>
<li>Summer Party</li>
<li>Neon Airstrip</li>
<li>Día de Muertos</li>
<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
<li>Lunar Drift Arena</li>
<li>Retrowave Highway</li>
<li>Cars and Coffee</li>
<li>Stadium Maze</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting new Horizon Realms exclusive awards will unlock four new Horizon Reward Cars:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024 Lamborghini Revuelto</li>
<li>2023 Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato</li>
<li>2018 Lotus Exige Cup 430</li>
<li>2022 Hennessey Mammoth 6x6</li>
</ul>
<p>Playground has discussed two ways to experience Horizon Realms. In Skill Mode, the Forza Horizon 5 user picks one of the Realms to enter and try to get as many Skill Scores as possible. Each Evolving World will have its own Skill Score Leaderboard, and there will also be an overall Skill Score Leaderboard that adds up all the points you have banked on each Realm. Earning enough Skill Score will also unlock new player badges unique to Horizon Realms.</p>
<p>In Free Mode, leaderboards are cast aside to focus on the fun factor. &nbsp;having fun on their favourite realms. Players can drive solo or with friends, earn badges tied to previous content updates, and unlock accolades to earn #Forzathon points.</p>

<p>As a side note, it's possible April will be a month to remember for PlayStation 5 users when it comes to Microsoft game releases. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/tom-warren-indiana-jones-for-ps5-is-targeting-an-april-release.1120953/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, MachineGames is aiming to launch the PS5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle in April, though that might still change.</p>
