			<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher and have patience, because The Witcher 4 will not be appearing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards 2025</a> next month. The highly anticipated RPG from CD Projekt RED will be skipping this year's awards and will presumably only show up on stage during the call-outs for the Most Anticipated Game award.</p>



<p>The news comes directly from the joint chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michał Nowakowski, who posted a message on X (formerly Twitter) expressing his gratitude that The Witcher 4 was nominated for the category, while also making sure to keep players' expectations in check.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards</em>," Nowakowski wrote. "<em>Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.</em>"</p>

<p>It's perhaps disappointing news for players who can't wait to get their hands on the next installment in CD Projekt RED's popular franchise, but it can't be too surprising. If you've been following The Witcher 4's production, then you'll have heard that CDPR confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">back in March 2025 that the game will not be released until 2027</a>.</p>



<p>We all still have a whole year of waiting before we can expect to start seeing new trailers and eventually, a release date. Nowakowski even reaffirmed this during the Q&amp;A portion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">CDPR's recent third-quarter financial report</a>. When asked about The Witcher 4, Nowakowski would not comment on the game's production, saying, "<em>The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>So, with this year's show off the table for The Witcher 4, anyone waiting to return to the world of The Witcher will have to turn their attention to The Game Awards 2026, since that's a strong candidate for when we'd see a significant trailer reveal.</p>



<p>As far as what will be at The Game Awards, we're starting to see select developers confirm their attendance and that they'll be bringing a new trailer. <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525">Exodus, for example, will be at the show with a new trailer reveal</a>.</p>
