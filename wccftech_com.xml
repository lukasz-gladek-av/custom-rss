			<p>While most franchise fans are primarily interested in the gameplay of Battlefield 6 for the various multiplayer modes, the game is also going to feature a full-fledged campaign, unlike Battlefield 2042. Earlier this week, Inverse <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/next-battlefield-game-campaign-alex-garland-civil-war-inspired" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to interview</a> some of the lead developers from Motive Studios, the team in charge of the single player story mode, who shared some of the inspirations and themes players will see in the game.</p>
<p>Creative Director Roman Campos-Oriola said:</p>
<p><em>I’m a big fan of Lioness.</em></p>
<p>Executive Producer Philippe Ducharme:</p>
<p><em>I really enjoyed Civil War. Some of the things that we’re pushing [in the Battlefield 6 campaign], the film is actually a good reference.</em></p>
<p>They're referring to Lioness, the American spy action thriller TV show released on Paramount+ with Zoe Saldaña as the main character, and Civil War, Alex Garland's dystopic action thriller movie where a despotic federal government and secessionist movements fight a bloody war within the United States. Both are great examples of action thriller plots, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Campos-Oriola then had this to say about the themes that will be explored in the Battlefield 6 story:</p>
<p><em>The elements we’re really interested in is the concept of talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations. That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we’re looking to capture in the single player.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two discussed how their previous work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Space remake</a> helped them prepare for the Battlefield 6 campaign project.</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> Dead Space allowed us to know the quirks and strengths that we all have, and how we complement each other as a team.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ducharme:</strong> On Dead Space, we talked a lot about the curve of tension. How to go from beat to beat, having the highs and the lows to keep players hooked, and even play with their expectations a little bit. It’s obviously very different in a game like Battlefield. But we still brought that mentality over.</em></p>
<p>Of course, that was a remake, but this time, Motive (which is also helping DICE produce multiplayer maps) had to do everything from scratch.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;this Summer for a launch window scheduled before April 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-speed-freeks-launches-out-of-early-access-next-week-major-changes-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhammer 40K: Speed Freeks is officially exiting early access and will have its 1.0 launch next week on <strong>May 22, 2025,</strong> developer Caged Element and publisher Wired Productions have announced.</p>
<p>It's launching as a structurally very different game than what it was. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-available-in-warhammer-40000-speed-freeks-and-more/">first knew</a> Warhammer 40K: Speed Freeks as a free-to-play combat racing game where you play as Orks in the Warhammer universe who want nothing more than to smash each other to bits, going at crazy speeds and racing cars with guns on them.</p>
<p>Now, it's still a combat racing game with the Orks and the aforementioned craziness, but it's no longer free-to-play. It'll also be published by Wired Productions, and not Plaion, as was previously the case.</p>
<p>If you jumped into the free-to-play early access version, you won't need to buy the game now that it'll be a premium release. A press release for Speed Freeks' launch has confirmed that players who were among the 250K people already playing Speed Freeks will be upgraded to the premium version for free.</p>
<p>All the microtransactions that were in the free-to-play version of the game will also be removed, and if you did purchase or earn any of the premium currency that existed in the free-to-play version, then you'll still be able to spend that for the next 12 months. For everyone else who didn't jump into the early access version, it'll launch at $15.99 USD.</p>

<p>The move to a premium game also means that the 1.0 version of the game will support player-hosted matches, private games, and have a free roam mode for players to explore the maps and create their own custom races.</p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we've had thousands of people help us achieve that goal,</em>" game director on Warhamemr 40K: Speed Freeks, Chris Mallinson said in a press release.</span></p>
<p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"<em>Along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we're launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop</em>" </span></p>
