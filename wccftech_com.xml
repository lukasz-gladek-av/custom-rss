			<p>The most significant announcement made at Tokyo Game Show 2025 was arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>. The massively successful open world racing franchise is returning next year to PC and Xbox consoles, featuring the long-coveted Japan setting.</p>



<p>When is it launching, though? Looking back at previous franchise entries, every Forza Horizon game has been released so far between September and November. However, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1994108555780297089#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to insider Nate the Hate</a>, that trend might change with Forza Horizon 6, because UK developer Playground Games is targeting a launch at some point in the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>The Fall launch window has worked wonders so far for the franchise. The most recent game, Forza Horizon 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached over 40 million players as of July 2024</a> and has since grown further, thanks to its launch on the PlayStation 5 console, where the title even <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outsold Sony's own first-party games for a while</a>.</p>



<p>However, 2026 is definitely a peculiar situation given that the release of the proverbial elephant in the room, Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI, has been postponed from May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Quite literally every triple-A game developer (and most indie ones, too) will want to distance their games as much as possible from that all-consuming void. Sure, Forza Horizon 6 belongs to a different enough genre, but why risk it? Of course, that all hinges on the game being ready to launch by then. </p>



<p>If the game is released in the first half of 2026, it will have been four and a half years since FH5, by far the longest gap between releases in the franchise. Playground Games may actually launch two games next year, given that their other big gamble, Fable, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed from 2025 to a generic 2026 window</a>. Fable might be released toward the end of next year (provided there isn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another delay into 2027</a>).</p>



<p>The developers have yet to reveal many details about Forza Horizon 6, although we already know the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>The map is designed around three key regions: the dense city of Tokyo, coastal areas, and mountain tōge roads. Playground Games is focusing less on raw size and more on density and verticality, especially in Tokyo, utilizing layered, multi-level roads inspired by <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-expansion-launches-on-july-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels expansion</a>.​</li>



<li>Map design emphasizes tight city streets, multi-story highways, mountain passes, and rural rice-field backroads, providing a diverse range of driving experiences within one map that include typically Japanese car races, such as urban street racing, mountain drifting, and high‑speed coastal runs.</li>



<li>The campaign progression harkens back to Forza Horizon 1's structure, where players start with slower cars and earn their way up, with faster tiers unlocking as they progress rather than being showered on them from the get-go.</li>



<li>The car roster in Forza Horizon 6 will be heavily expanded with Japanese flavor, including kei cars and kei vans, which appear both as drivable garage vehicles and AI traffic.</li>



<li>The open world will '<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blow fans away</a>', between the inherent beauty of Japanese environments and the tech improvements made to the engine.</li>
</ul>



<p>While the game has only been announced for PC and Xbox Series S and X, a PlayStation 5 version is inevitable given the success encountered by its predecessor. The only question is whether it will be released later in 2026 or in 2027, but we'll keep you up to date on those rumors and news as soon as they become available.</p>

			<p>Today, Bloober Team announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/exclusive-bloober-team-is-bringing-layers-of-fear-to-switch-2-next-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Nintendo Life</a> that Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition is launching soon on the Nintendo Switch 2. The hybrid handheld/home console platform will receive the first-person horror game on December 19, priced at $39.99. </p>



<p>According to the official info, this version of the game will support High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays as well as ray tracing. This will make it part of the highly restricted club of Nintendo Switch 2 games that actually leverage the hardware's capabilities for ray tracing; for example, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-runs-30-fps-nvidia-dlss-baked-gi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to drop ray traced global illumination in the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in favor of baked global illumination for performance reasons.</p>



<p>Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition also features platform-specific improvements, like native motion controls, touch-screen gameplay, and Joy-Con integration. This edition includes all of the Layers of Fear games and DLCs released so far, bringing together the intertwined stories of the three main characters (the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer), each consumed by their devotion to art.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a> of the PC version, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em>They say an artist's work is never truly done, but with Layers of Fear, Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have completed the Master Opus started back in 2016. With superb Unreal Engine 5 powered visuals, improved writing and some new gameplay mechanics, these journeys into the darkest recesses of the human mind have never been so immersive, although some issues prevent Layers of Fear from being an absolute masterpiece.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Since the days of Layers of Fear, Bloober Team has released the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly successful Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and a new franchise of its own, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, which recently reached 500K units sold. The team also <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed another deal with KONAMI</a> to remake the first Silent Hill game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, modder xoxor4d released the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>. This public build even comes with a simple installer, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/gta4-rtx/releases/tag/1.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, making it relatively easy for users to install it.</p>



<p>Xoxor4d shared a detailed changelog of improvements over the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod test build that was released last month. You can find it below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Added a basic installer</li>



<li>Removed alpha blending on some emissive surfaces that were not supposed to be alpha-blended</li>



<li>Night emissives now turn off during the day</li>



<li>Map markers can now be shown/hidden based on the time of day or the current weather</li>



<li>Added a button to teleport yourself to a map marker</li>



<li>Added a FreeCam mode and added a new Utilities tab to the imgui menu</li>



<li>Reduced the default emissive intensity of some surfaces</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that broke the remix debug views</li>



<li>No longer using timecycle temperature because it was not related to color tuning - now using a hardcoded value + reduced influence</li>



<li>Added a special remix replacement to the first apartment</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Remix Runtime</em></p>
</blockquote>



<ul>
<li>Added raindrops/splashes to wet world surfaces (disabled by default for pedestrians and vehicles because of varying UV scales, which makes raindrops really large on some cars and really small on others)</li>



<li>Added "puddle logic" to the global wetness code to break up the mirror-like surfaces</li>



<li>The <code>Ignore Lights</code> category can be used to disable the <code>WorldUI</code> texture tag that is automatically set on some emissive surfaces. This allows one to set custom emissive masks and tweaks via a remix replacement while keeping the dynamic intensity adjustment by the game</li>
</ul>



<p>The highlight of the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod is obviously that it injects path tracing into Rockstar's 2008 classic game. The result is a massive visual improvement, as you can see in the featured image and in the additional comparison screenshot below.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GTA-4-RTX-Remix-Mod-PT-Comparison-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: MxBenchmark PC (YouTube)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, path tracing, like in any other PC game (and perhaps even more so in a mod that is not as well optimized as a full game for obvious reasons), is rather heavy on performance. As shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the MxBenchmark PC comparison video</a>, even NVIDIA's expensive GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card cannot run the GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod at 60 frames per second without the help of DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Modder xoxor4d did have a couple of tips for those who may struggle with performance, though. Those who experience heavy stuttering can try to launch the mod using the included 'LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_2Cores_GTA4.bat' file. This will allocate two cores to GTA4 and the remaining cores to Remix. Another option is splitting your CPU cores 50/50 with NVIDIA RTX Remix; to do that, use the '_LaunchWithProcessorAffinity_Half_GTA4__Half_Remix.bat' file.</p>



<p>The path tracing settings can also be lowered a bit. Just like in every RTX Remix game, you can open the menu by pressing Alt + X. In the Graphics Settings Menu, switch to the Graphics tab and then adjust various quality settings in the Graphics Preset dropdown as needed.</p>



<p>Another tweak that might help performance (though it will also make leaves more blocky) is increasing the Tree Alpha Cutout Value. To do that, open the CompMod menu by pressing F4 and open the Rendering Related Settings container under the Game Settings tab.</p>



<p>Lastly, you can of course still tweak the quality and distance sliders in the regular Grand Theft Auto 4 graphics options. Keeping in mind that higher values will reach your CPU bottleneck earlier, the modder recommends starting with 50 for view distance and 30 for quality and adjusting from there. When making this adjustment, xoxor4d warned that the first launch might cause problems, but a second attempt should resolve the issue.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this GTA 4 RTX Remix Compatibility mod can help Grand Theft Auto fans cope with the additional time they'll have to wait until the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> from the previous date of May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026. Rumors suggest Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-switch-2-explored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may even be trying to make the game run on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though even if that's happening, it would likely be launched at a later date.</p>
