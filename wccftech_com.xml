			<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is a new turn-based RPG from developer and publisher Epictellers Entertainment, that's currently set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026 as an early access title on Steam. There's also a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight">Kickstarter campaign</a> players can register their interest in now, to be a part of the development journey for this new sci-fi fantasy adventure.</p>



<p>Set in the world of the popular tabletop role-playing game, Starfinder, this new adventure includes new characters, each with their own unique story lines, and brings Starfinder's second edition ruleset to the digital world for the first time.</p>



<p>Epictellers Entertainment will be working in collaboration with Starfinder's creators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathfinder-kingmaker-crpg-chris-avellone/">Paizo</a>, on the project, but Epictellers will be the ones both publishing and leading development on the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re thrilled to unveil Starfinder: Afterlight in partnership with Paizo,</em>" said Epictellers Entertainment co-founder and chief executive officer, Ricard Pillosu, in a press release. "<em>This marks the beginning of a journey we want to take alongside Starfinder fans everywhere. We can’t wait to share more about the ragtag crew navigating the Pact Worlds, full of danger and adventure."</em></p>

<p>For Paizo's part, publisher and chief creative officer, Erik Mona, added, "<em>Starfinder’s universe is rich, vast, and beloved</em>. <em>Epictellers Entertainment's vision aligns perfectly with the essence of our galaxy. We believe they’re the ideal team to bring this next chapter of the franchise to life.</em>"</p>

<p>Afterlight will have you assemble six companions for your journey, each fitting into one of six categories for the turn-based fights: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. You'll travel to multiple locations in the universe and engage in a narrative-focused adventure where the choices you make will impact the outcome of the game.</p>



<p>Another interesting tidbit is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-features-voice-acting-from-neil-newbon-astarion-in-baldurs-gate-3/">Neil Newbon</a>, the actor who many will know from <a href="https://wccftech.com/larians-final-major-game-patch-for-baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-out-now-on-all-platforms/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and most recently from Surgent Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date/">Dead Take</a>, is directing the voice cast.</p>



<p>Today's announcement and screenshots have provided a good foundation for what Afterlight could become, but the real test is always the first view of live gameplay. Hopefully, we'll be able to check some gameplay footage before the end of the year.</p>
