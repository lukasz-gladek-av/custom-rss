			<p>Hello Games has just dropped another massive, and of course, free, update for No Man's Sky with the release of its Voyagers update, and version 6.0 of the game that first launched on PC and PS4 all the way back in 2016.</p>



<p>One of the key elements of this new update is how Hello Games has rebuilt the way ship building works in the game, as you can now build completely custom ships that you can walk around in, decorate how you like, filling each of the various rooms with your friends and fellow explorers, and jump out into space from to enjoy the vastness of the universe if you find yourself in a particularly pretty part of space.</p>

<p>After recently releasing No Man's Sky on <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massively-improved-switch-2-version-lets-you-be-a-towns-mayor/">Nintendo Switch 2,</a> Hello Games founder Sean Murray and the rest of the studio have made it clear they're seemingly nowhere done with updates for the game, with Voyagers now No Man's Sky's 39th named update since its historic launch. "<em></em><em>I can’t believe it’s been just over nine years since No Man’s Sky first launched</em>," Murray said in a press release. Frankly, considering how different, yet similar, the game looks, neither can we.</p>



<p>Murray continues by detailing some of what's possible with Voyagers and how players can approach ship building in this new update. "<em>We call them Corvettes, huge ships with hulls, wings, landing gear, cockpits, engine parts, thrusters and more - arranged to your own unique sci-fi design,"</em> he says. "<em>These ships have real interiors, med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters. It comes with you everywhere, which totally changes how you play. Decorating it with your friends gives you a space that you share together. Whether it's a brightly coloured tiny explorer, or a colossal dark metallic war ship, it allows you to show off your own personality.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Adding bigger weapons to your Corvette increases your firepower. Add sleeping quarters and a mission radar, and you are ready to welcome a crew of friends on board. Add a mission radar and you are ready to adventure. A teleporter and you have an away team. Or just a window… and suddenly there are these special moments, watching as the universe flies by outside at warp speed.</em>"</p>

<p>He also reminds players, just in case they've forgotten, that all the tech Hello Games is building for No Man's Sky is also being built for <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/">Light No Fire,</a> the next ambitious project from the studio that, instead of giving you a whole universe to explore, will charge you with exploring one large, Earth-sized, detailed planet. It's a whole new kind of challenge, and it is one of the most anticipated titles in the video game landscape.</p>



<p>"<em>I can’t believe that in the past 12 months we released Worlds Part I, Worlds Part II, and Voyagers - all huge changes to this game we care about so much</em>," Murray added. "<em>Many thanks for any support you continue to provide our little game. It really helps us continue to do what we do.</em>"</p>



<p>Voyagers is now available for No Man's Sky players on all platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Herman Hulst, once the studio head of Guerilla Games, then president of PlayStation Studios, and now chief executive officer of Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Group, spoke to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299">Financial Times (paywalled)</a> about Sony's live service efforts. Following Sony's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-admits-live-service-push-isnt-going-smoothly/">admission of the obvious, that things aren't going great</a>, Hulst says the company is trying to learn from its failures like Concord, adding that if there will be failures, he'd rather they come "<em>early, and cheaply</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I don't want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply,</em>" Hulst said. "<em>We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in many different ways. The advantage of every failure</em> <em>[...] is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is</em>."</p>



<p>When PlayStation first began its live service push that Hulst and former Sony Interactive Entertainmnet boss Jim Ryan championed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/">Sony wanted to have released 10 live service games by March 2026</a>. Not only is that not going to happen, but most of those projects have been cancelled at this point. Regarding that fact, Hulst is seemingly unbothered, saying that the "<em>number of [live services releases] is not so important</em>."</p>



<p>What's more important to him is "<em>having a diverse set of player experiences and a set of communities,"</em> and a key aspect of achieving that goal for Hulst is making original IPs, like how Concord was a new IP.</p>



<p>"<em>We take a very intentional approach to IP creation […] understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then become a franchise for people beyond gaming."</em> </p>



<p>Concord, as everyone who does not live under a rock and plays video games today knows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">was a massive failure</a> that did not come as "<em>early and cheaply</em>" as Hulst would prefer. Instead, it made it all the way to launch, lived for two weeks, and died a very costly death. Firewalk Studios was shuttered, and it remains a moment in time that PlayStation fans won't soon forget whenever Sony's live service ambitions crop up.</p>



<p>On those ambitions, we recently had a scare that Fairgames, the upcoming live service title from Haven Studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/">had been cancelled, though that was quickly refuted</a>. Still, it doesn't look great for that game since Haven Studio's founder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-founder-jade-raymond-leaves-the-playstation-first-party-studio/">Jade Raymond, departed the studio</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>Speaking of games that don't look like they're in great shape, Bungie is trying to pick up the pieces of Marathon <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">that weren't plagiarized</a>, after delaying the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">without providing a new release date this past June</a>.</p>



<p>To say things could have been going "<em>smoother</em>" is an understatement. Hulst says that PlayStation is trying to learn from its mistakes, which is a good thing, but learning what went wrong is only half the battle. Actually avoiding the error the next time shows the lesson sunk in, and so far, we've no proof from PlayStation that it has learned the lessons taught by its live service push thus far.</p>
