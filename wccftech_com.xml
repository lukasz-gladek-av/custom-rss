			<p>Ahead of Anno 117: Pax Romana releasing on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming November 13, 2025, Ubisoft has released a new gameplay deep dive trailer, going over what the game's campaign will focus on, and what's coming in the game's Year 1 Content Pass.</p>



<p>In Anno 117: Pax Romana's campaign, players will step into the role of Marcus or Marcia, and after being appointed a Roman governor, you'll try to shape the Celtic region you are charged with leading, and decide whether to enforce Roman traditions, or find ways to blend Roman and Celtic culture. Your campaign will also be slightly changed depending on who you choose to play as. Choosing Marcus will set one specific path in motion, and choosing Marcia, another.</p>

<p>After release, the Year 1 content pass for Pax Romana will include three DLC releases. Provinces of Ash, the first DLC release, will introduce Latium, a large island with new cultural encounters, and a towering volcano that could prove to be a problem. The second DLC release is The Hippodrome, which adds a large stadium arena for players to construct and hold chariot races and big entertaining events for citizens.</p>



<p>The third is called Dawn of the Delta, which adds a new river-based province and a new culture as you expand to the Egyptian frontier.</p>



<p>Ubisoft did not yet say as to what the pace of these DLC releases will be, but since they're supposed to last for the first year of Pax Romana, it's probably a safe bet that they'll be fairly spaced out.</p>

			<p>Today, Techland has outlined its eleven-week roadmap of updates coming to Dying Light: The Beast. The game launched a month ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was immediately successful among fans</a>; now, the developers are ready to make it even better in the coming three months.</p>



<p>Confirmed additions include the New Game+ mode, Legend Levels, Nightmare Difficulty, new weapon executions, and Ray Tracing support on PC, which was suddenly removed just ahead of the launch, much to the detriment of the game's visual quality. There's also going to be a collaboration with PUBG Mobile.</p>



<p>Moreover, Techland announced a global community initiative titled Call of the Beast. The event started today and runs until January 7, 2026. New challenges and exclusive rewards will be introduced every week on Thursday.</p>



<p>Throughout this campaign, players worldwide will work together to achieve weekly goals that celebrate teamwork, persistence, and the strength of the Dying Light: The Beast community. Each challenge offers exclusive rewards that appear in participantsâ€™ in-game stash once the objectives are met. Every week, from new weapons to unique car skins, brings fresh surprises and reasons to celebrate the collective success. Players must contribute to that week's goal to receive the weekly rewards.</p>



<p>Sticking together with the community to complete at least 17 of the 22 goals will unlock a secret Legendary Reward, which players will receive at the end of the event. Additionally, if the community completes 20 goals, everyone who participated in at least one challenge will receive all the rewards, regardless of when they started playing Call of the Beast.</p>

<p>The first community challenge is called Season to Dismember and asks players to cut off 30 million limbs for a Lumberjack Car Skin and 60 million limbs for a Woodchopper Axe. This challenge will last until Thursday, October 23 at 4 PM CEST.</p>
