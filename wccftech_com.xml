			<p>Ubisoft has cancelled <strong>six games and delayed seven more </strong>as part of a "<strong><em>major reset"</em></strong> for the company. The cancelled projects include the long-awaited and much-troubled <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, while the other cancelled projects were all unannounced titles. One of them was an unannounced mobile title, and out of the remaining four, three were brand new IPs. While the seven delayed projects reportedly include the unannounced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a press release sent to Wccftech that outlines how Ubisoft is entirely reorganizing itself into "<em><strong>five creative houses</strong>," </em>all built to support a new strategic focus for the company. It adds that the previously announced closure of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/"><strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong>,</a> layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/"><strong>RedLynx</strong>,</a> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">Massive Entertainment</a></strong>, and the now-confirmed closure of <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong> are all part of this reset.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, Ubisoft announces a major organizational, operational, and portfolio reset designed to reclaim its creative leadership, regain agility and drive a sharp rebound, renewing the Group's trajectory toward sustainable growth and robust cash generation</em>," the press release begins.</p>

<p>"<em>The new operating model will further empower the execution of the Group's strategy, centered on Open World Adventure and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.</em>"</p>



<p>It's quite the shift, especially for fans who were waiting on the Sands of Time Remake, which has gone from <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/">being rumoured to release sometime in early 2026,</a> to not at all. As to why it was cancelled, the company claimed that the remake, and the five other cancelled projects did "<em>not meet the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level</em>."</p>



<p>As for the seven delayed games, while Ubisoft doesn't name any of them as they are all officially unannounced, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mcx4n6jqds2c">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, one of the delayed projects is the long-rumoured Black Flag remake. The seven projects are being given more time "<em>to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation</em>." They're also getting updated revenue expectations, to go along with the delays.</p>



<p>The five creative houses break down all of Ubisoft's IPs into their own categories. The first is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/"><strong>Vantage Studios</strong>, its new <strong>Tencent-backed</strong> subsidiary,</a> which houses the <strong>Assassin's Creed, Far Cry</strong>, and <strong>Rainbow Six</strong> franchises. The rest of the creative houses don't have official titles other than 'Creative House' two through five, though each of them will have "<em>dedicated leadership with a clear creative mandate and accountability.</em>" Each creative house will also have "<em>end-to-end</em> <em>responsibility for its portfolio, overseeing the full creative and brand scope from development to publishing (brand, marketing and sales go-to-market strategy).</em>"  </p>



<p>The second creative house will focus on "<em>cooperative shooter experiences</em>" and be the home for <strong>The Division, Ghost Recon, </strong>and <strong>Splinter Cell</strong>. The third creative house is focused on <em>"a roster of select, sharp live experiences</em>," including <strong>For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla,</strong> and <strong>Skull &amp; Bones.</strong></p>



<p>The fourth creative house is dedicated to "<em>immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes</em>," and it'll be the home for <strong>Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia,</strong> and <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong>. Finally, the fifth creative house will be its home for "<em>casual and family-friendly games</em>," including <strong>Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno,</strong> and <strong>Hasbro.</strong> Ubisoft also confirmed that part of this restructure includes the development of <strong>four new IPs</strong>, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-moba-from-amazon/">the recently acquired <strong>March of Giants</strong>.</a></p>



<p>"<em>On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands</em>," began chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, in a press release. "<em>On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization</em>...<em>While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term</em>."</p>
