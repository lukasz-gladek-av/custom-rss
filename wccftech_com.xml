			<p>At CES 2025, we learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> PC handheld will be the first officially licensed SteamOS-powered device not manufactured by Valve. There has been much speculation about whether and when SteamOS would officially move beyond the Steam Deck, and it's finally happening.</p>
<p>Valve itself&nbsp;<span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the subject in</span> a blog post, explaining that this will be the exact same version of SteamOS available on their own Steam Deck. A team is working to ensure everything will work just as well when the device ships. Moreover, Valve said that this work to support the Lenovo Legion Go S will also improve compatibility with other handhelds. Before this handheld ships on the market, Valve plans to ship a beta version of SteamOS that will improve the experience on other handhelds for users to download and test for themselves. The work will continue after the device's launch, too, as you would expect from Valve.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems like the Lenovo Legion Go S will have two variants, one without SteamOS and one with Valve's operating system. The former will be available later this month with the regular Windows, priced at $729.99 initially, although a configuration priced at $599.99 is expected to be available in May. That's also when the SteamOS version of the handheld is due to launch at an even cheaper of $499.99.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S Windows Variant</figcaption></figure>
<p>The $729.99 version is the one equipped with the Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor, which likely explains the higher price. The other two versions, either Windows or SteamOS, will feature the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor. The price difference is likely due to licensing fees.</p>
<p>Other than that, the specifications should be the same: 8” WUXGA 16:10 120Hz PureSight touch display with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, up to 32GB of 7500Mhz LPDDR5X RAM, 3-cell 55.5Whr battery, two USB 4 ports, a microSD card reader, and WiFi6e support.</p>

			<p>Games available on the Xbox Game Pass can expect to lose around 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, although being available as part of the subscription can be beneficial for some of them.</p>
<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session hosted on the <a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/news-publisher/industry-q-a-christopher-dring-answers-your-questions.37/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Install Base forums</a>, former head of GamesIndustry.biz Chris Dring revealed some interesting tidbits on sales of games available on Xbox Game Pass, saying that any game can expect to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, less if it is a big mainstream release. How low Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and even Starfield have charted makes it clear how Game Pass hurt the sales of these games on Xbox consoles. Being available on Xbox Game Pass, however, can also be beneficial for multiplatform games, as a surge of players on Xbox can have a strong impact on sales on PlayStation.</p>
<p>While a game being available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library can lead to lost sales, it can also make it easier for developers to get people to try out their game. Chris Dring highlighted that, from data, it is known that a lot of people only play the Call of Duty series, and if some of them got the game via the Xbox Game Pass this year, they might have tried another game available on the subscription service they may otherwise never have played. Unfortunately, this may be a best-case scenario, as the limited growth of subscription services and the existence of big free games that are hundreds of hours long makes it unlikely.</p>
<p>While Microsoft never made it clear, it's evident from the company's marketing messaging and some of its latest decisions, such as the first major changes introduced to the service <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">last year </a>since its launch, that the Xbox Game Pass is impacting their console business. According to well-known analyst Mat Piscatella, the company's approach to its subscription service needs to be balanced with its other services, and the aforementioned changes introduced last year suggest that this is what Microsoft is attempting to do. Balancing the service and further expanding on other systems, according to the analyst, could make Xbox's future <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-reckons-xbox-has-a-bright-future-according-to-sales-data/">bright.</a></p>

			<p>While Nintendo seems content to wait some more before announcing the Nintendo Switch 2, accessories manufacturers aren't pleased about the system still being kept under wraps, and some have started revealing more about the highly anticipated console.</p>
<p>Accessories manufacturer Genki is showcasing its Nintendo Switch 2 accessories lineup at CES 2025, and reputable French publication <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numerama</a> had the chance to check out a mock-up of the system reportedly based on a real system the manufacturer owns and how the new magnetic Joy-Con controllers work. The new mock-up also confirms a bigger size over the original console and a second USB-C port on the top of the console.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="fr">VIDEO — La Nintendo Switch 2 en avant-première au <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a>.</p>
<p>L'accessoiriste Genki indique posséder la vraie console et expose une maquette 3D + des accessoires.</p>
<p>Les détails ici : <a href="https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1">https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1</a> <a href="https://t.co/IJ6taQggIQ">pic.twitter.com/IJ6taQggIQ</a></p>
<p>— Numerama (@Numerama) <a href="https://twitter.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Following the report from Numerama, Genki decided to go all-in with the early Nintendo Switch 2 reveal by adding a short video on its <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> showcasing the full unit and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-dock-60w-charger/">dock</a>. While there's no way to verify if everything is indeed based on the real system or on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">other mock-ups</a>, there's a solid chance the video is showing the real console, given how pretty much everything about it is leaking online.</p>
<p>Genki isn't the only Nintendo Switch 2 accessories manufacturer showing its upcoming products during CES 2025, and Numerama spoke with some of them, who all seem to agree that the system will launch in April. According to some of these manufacturers, it is possible to even purchase the console already on the black market, which, as Numerama highlights, sounds like a bold claim considering nothing has leaked regarding software.</p>
<p>With new leaks and rumors sprouting like mushrooms almost daily, the only thing that is left is for Nintendo to finally announce the Nintendo Switch 2. When the reveal will happen not even these chatty manufacturers know, but with all these daily leaks, it shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

			<p>This morning, CAPCOM <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXWAYmEQKso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds will soon get a second Open Beta test (the first one <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took place</a> in late October) ahead of the full release in late February.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto shared the news in a brief new video, where he also introduced the differences fans will find in this new test compared to the previous one. The main addition is that&nbsp;players will be able to hunt the returning monster Gypceros.</p>
<p>Other than that, the beta will still feature Character Creation, Story Trial, and the quest to slay Doshaguma. Character creation data will carry over from the previous beta, so if you've played before, you will find your character waiting. Even more interestingly, all this character creation data from the beta tests can be transferred into the full game once purchased. However, no game progress will transfer.</p>
<p>Folks who participated in either of the Open Beta tests will receive special items to be redeemed in the full game: a decorative charm for your weapons or Seikret and an item pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Year's Greetings 2025 | Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXWAYmEQKso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tsujimoto also revealed that CAPCOM is working hard at improving Monster Hunter Wilds in various ways based on feedback from the earlier Open Beta test. However, these tweaks and fixes won't be ready for the second test, which will take place on all platforms between February 6 and 9 (starting and ending at 7 PM Pacific Time) and again between February 13 and 16.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to Monster Hunter World (which turned out to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-world-has-shipped-over-20-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best-selling game CAPCOM has ever made</a>, having sold nearly 21 million units on its own and 27 when factoring in the Iceborne expansion), the hype surrounding Monster Hunter Wilds is just as massive as the biggest monsters featured in the game.</p>
<p>In our testing, the anticipation is likely to be fulfilled by the final product, which is out on February 28. In his Gamescom 2024 hands-on preview, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>
<p><em>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't revolutionize the series' formula in any way, it competently continues to smooth out some of the formula's rough edges to present a more engaging experience. This little taste of the experience left me hungering for more, and I really cannot wait to see what surprises the game has in store for hunters when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S next year.</em></p>
