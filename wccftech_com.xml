			<p>A God of War live service game has been in the works at Bluepoint Games for a while, but it has now been confirmed to have been canceled, together with another yet-to-be-revealed project from another studio.</p>
<p>A new report posted on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> today confirmed that Sony canceled two more games that were part of the unfortunate live service initiative that has seen one failure after another. The two games were the aforementioned God of War live service game by Bluepoint Games, and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-bend-studio-next-game-multiplayer-open-world-systems/"> yet-to-be-revealed project</a> from Days Gone developer Bend Studio. The two games, according to a company spokesperson, were canceled following a recent review, but the two studios won't be closed off, as both Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games are <em>"highly accomplished teams"</em> that are valuable members of the PlayStation Studios family. Their next project will be determined together with Sony, the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>It's really unfortunate to learn this way what the mysterious game Bluepoint Games has been working on for a while was. Following the release of the excellent Demon's Souls remake, which was one of the best PlayStation 5 launch titles, the studio helped with the development of God of War Ragnarok until 2022. Now, what the studio will work on is unclear, according to the report's author, Jason Schreier. Maybe it really is time for that rumored Bloodborne remake or remaster? Only time will tell.</p>

<p lang="en">PlayStation fans have speculated for years about Bluepoint's new projects since the well-received PS5 remake of Demon's Souls (2020).</p>
<p>I can report that from 2020-2022 they were helping on God of War Ragnarok. Since then they've been on the live-service project that was canceled today. Now, unclear</p>
