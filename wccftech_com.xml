			<p>Borderlands 4, the next entry in the series launching later this year on PC and consoles, has become available for pre-order today, finally confirming the game's price.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-now-available-for-pre-order-post-launch-content-to-include-story-missions-and-all-new-vault-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> shared today, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the game's Standard Edition will launch in the United States for $69.99 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. For a few weeks, statements from Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-says-a-real-fan-will-find-a-way-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-if-that-ends-up-being-the-price/">suggested</a> the fourth entry in the series would be among the increasing number of games retailing at $80 at launch, but thankfully, that was not the case.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the price of the Borderlands 4 Standard Edition, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the details of the Deluxe Edition and the Super Deluxe Editions, which will retail for $99.99 and $129.99, respectively. The first will include the Bounty Pack Bundle featuring four separate post-launch DLC packs, each with distinct areas, new missions, and unique bosses; four Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards; new gear and weapons; four new vehicles, and Vault Hunter cosmetics; and the Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin. The second will include not only the Bounty Pack Bundle but also the Vault Hunter Pack featuring two new Story Packs, each featuring a new Vault Hunter, story, and side missions, two new map regions, new gear and weapons, more Vault Hunter cosmetics, and new ECHO-4 cosmetics.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th. The game will also be available at launch on the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.</p>
