			<p>Arc System Works was one of the studios we predicted would appear <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a>, specifically with a release date for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. Well, we were right that we'd get to see Arc System Works and with more Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, but we did not get a release date revealed, and are still saddled with an expected release window of '2026.' That said, there is a new closed beta lined up before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Arc System Works also showed off more gameplay for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, and two of the game's developers also made an appearance during the live stream to talk more about the game, and how the studio wanted to blend Japanese art styles with the style of the comic books.</p>



<p>The new closed beta will run from December 5-7, and adds Spider-Man and Ghost Rider to the roster of playable characters to try out in the beta. It'll also include two new stages, and a bevy of fixes and tweaks based on feedback from the game's first closed beta earlier this year.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you registered for the first closed beta and participated, then you'll be automatically registered for this one. If you registered for the first one and didn't participate, then you should keep an eye on your email inbox for an invitation. If you didn't register for the first closed beta but want to try your luck this time, then <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/">you can register at this link</a>.</p>



<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is due to launch on PC and PS5 sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>Just as the community <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">was bemoaning the lack of post-launch support</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a> that new DLC is coming to Elden Ring Nightreign, and it'll arrive before the end of the year. The new expansion, The Forsaken Hollows, will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming December 4, 2025.</p>



<p>This paid DLC expansion adds a few new features to the game, with two new playable Nightfarers to players to try out, two new bosses that FromSoftware is currently being quite tight-lipped about, and what sounds like a new area to explore within Limveld.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are called the Scholar and the Undertaker. The Scholar is described as "<em>boasting impressive arcane levels,</em>" and gains "<em>incredible advantages through battlefield observation</em>," while the Undertaker features "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>."</p>



<p>It's not exactly an in-depth description of either character's kit, but it's seemingly all we get for now. We'll definitely learn more the closer we get to the DLC's launch.</p>



<p>As far as the new bosses, all FromSoftware marketing representative Miku Watanabe has to say in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation Blog post</a> is: "<em>Players will confront two new bosses tormenting Limveld</em>." So, it seems like the new bosses also go in the category of, 'things we'll learn about later.'</p>



<p>Lastly, the DLC also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that has opened up in Limveld that players will get to explore in the new DLC, described as a place that is "<em>strewn with exotic ruins and temples; sacred towers denoting the remains of an ancient people; and crystals that exude a cursed, life-draining miasma</em>."</p>



<p>The DLC will be available for $15 USD, though if you purchased the Deluxe Edition of Nightreign, then you'll just get the DLC added to your library when it arrives on December 4, 2025. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long to learn more about the DLC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake-arrives-on-ps5-in-march-2026.1350445/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As one of the big announcements to kick off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">State of Play Japan event,</a> Koei Tecmo announced that Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake, a remake of the classic entry into the Fatal Frame franchise, will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>A new trailer for the remake was showcased during the live stream event, which concluded with a reveal of the game's release date. It's the latest re-release in the Fatal Frame series after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/fatal-frame-mask-of-the-lunar-eclipse-release-date/"> remaster for Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</a>.</p>



<p>A post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake-launches-march-12/">PlayStation Blog</a> that went live shortly after the trailer premiered delved into the main characters in the game and an overview of the game's story, but unfortunately did not go into too much detail about what is being upgraded in this remake. </p>



<p>"<em>Every element has been enhanced — from graphics and sound to controls. The texture of each character’s skin and clothing has been meticulously refined, while the setting of Minakami Village has been beautifully reimagined with striking contrasts of light and shadow to create an atmosphere that is both haunting and lifelike</em>," writes Makoto Shibata, director of the Fatal Frame series at Koei Tecmo.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in late October</a>, Bethesda released Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition yesterday for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X, as a way to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original launch. </p>



<p>This new version of the critically acclaimed post-apocalyptic open world roleplaying game includes all the six official DLCs released by Bethesda Game Studios (Far Harbor, Automatron, Nuka-World, Contraptions Workshop, Vault-Tec Workshop and Wasteland Workshop), as well as over 150 Creation Club items, including new quests, companions, armors, weapons, skins, player homes, and objects to add to the Settlements system. Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, which will launch next year for Nintendo Switch 2, is priced at $59.99 for new users, $39.99 for those upgrading from the original game, and $19.99 for those upgrading from the Game of the Year edition.</p>

<p>However, just like with <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> four years ago, this new edition breaks many essential mods that users had based their modlists around. The main reason is that F4SE, the equivalent of SKSE, an extender upon which many mods are based, no longer works (until its creators update it).</p>



<p>And just like with Skyrim Anniversary Edition, modders have quickly come up with a method to revert Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition to the previous version of the game (v1.10.984), thus preventing the breaking of your precious mods.</p>



<p>The first to post a guide on how to do that was Nexus Mods user ocramuias (in the comments section of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a>). Here's an abridged version of that guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the Steam console by pressing Win + R and pasting <strong>steam://open/console</strong></li>



<li>Run the following command inside the Steam console: <strong>download_depot 377160 377162 5698952341602575696</strong></li>



<li>This forces Steam to download the Fallout4.exe file (38 MB in size) from the previous build, version 1.10.984, which was originally released on May 13, 2024. When the download is complete, open the folder shown in the console log. This can usually be found in <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_377160\depot_377162</strong></li>



<li>Once there, you must back up your current executable. Navigate to your game's installation directory (for example, <strong>C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Fallout 4</strong>), and rename the existing Fallout4.exe to Fallout4_111137.exe. Now, copy the previously downloaded file into that folder and replace the existing .exe file.</li>



<li>At this point, it's time to disable automatic updates for Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition. You can do that in Steam &gt; Library &gt; Fallout 4 &gt; Properties &gt; Updates &gt; set "Only update this game when I launch it". From now on, you'll always have to launch the game through <strong>f4se_loader.exe</strong> rather than Steam.</li>



<li>Also, set Fallout4.exe to Read-only by right-clicking with the mouse and going to Properties. This will prevent Steam from overwriting it.</li>
</ol>



<p>Enjoy!</p>
