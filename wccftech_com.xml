			<p>EA has announced that it will not release F1 26 in the coming year; instead, EA Sports F1 25 will get a major expansion meant to cover the 2026 Formula 1 season, with the series returning to its regular mainline release in 2027 with EA Sports F1 27.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">announced in a blog post on the EA website</a>, in which EA claims the decision was made "<em>as part of a strategic reset for the F1 franchise</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following on from F1 25’s commercial and critical success - with praise from players, media, content creators, and F1 drivers alike - the team is building on the experience through a paid expansion," </em>the post reads.<em> "The premium content update will bring players closer to the sport’s major changes for 2026 that includes new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The decision to offer a premium content update for F1® 25 is part of a strategic reset for the F1® Franchise. In 2027, a new game will be released that looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices.</em>"</p>

<p>Codemasters senior creative director, Lee Mather, added, <em></em><em>"We’re fully committed to the EA SPORTS F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year’s excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world.</em>"</p>



<p>With Codemasters taking a year off in many ways to get ready for the next full release in 2027, it'll be interesting to see what the jump between F1 25 and F1 27 looks like. Also, regarding next year's big paid expansion for F1 25, meant to cover the 2026 F1 season, the price that expansion releases at will likely make or break the success of this experiment.</p>
