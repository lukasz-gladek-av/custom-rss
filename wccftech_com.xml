			<p>NVIDIA Game Ready version 566.36 driver is now available for download, introducing support for this month's biggest games, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>Besides featuring optimizations for the highly anticipated game developed by MachineGames, which launches in a few hours for owners of either the Premium Edition or the Collector's Edition, the new Game Ready driver brings support for Delta Force, Marvel Rivals, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-path-of-exile-2-to-the-list-premium-monthly-subscription-is-50-off-until-december-30/">Path of Exile 2</a>, as well as support for the next Forza Motorsport update, which introduces ray-traced global illumination, and for the next Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 update which brings NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS 3, both Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Marvel Rivals will release with support for NVIDIA's tech which boosts performance considerably at all resolutions and on all RTX 4000 series GPU. In MachineGames' title, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS 3 can double performance on an RTX 4090 at 4K resolution, Supreme preset, and ray tracing. In Marvel Rivals, using NVIDIA DLSS 3 can boost performance by 2.8 times on average at 4K resolution on an RTX 4080.</p>

			<p>Following the Black Friday GeForce NOW promotion that <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-black-friday-deal-halves-price-of-3-month-premium-memberships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discounted</a> premium tiers (Performance and Ultimate) by 50% for three-month subscriptions, NVIDIA has announced another promotion that will run through December 50. The discount is the same (50%), but it will now be applied to new monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle by MachineGames will be supported by GeForce NOW on day one. Owners of the Ultimate tier will be able to activate all the technical bells and whistles, such as NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. By the way, the game's official requirements have just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-the-first-game-to-require-hardware-ray-tracing-support-full-specs-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>The other big weekly addition to GFN is Path of Exile 2, which debuts tomorrow on early access. Our Francesco De Meo had this to say about the action RPG following a recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-off preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>From what I have experienced and what the developers Grinding Gear Games have shown so far, Path of Exile 2 has the chance of becoming one of the best action RPGs ever released, if not the very best, taking everything that made the original great and competently modernizing it while expanding the experience in so many ways that it wouldn't be surprising to see players spend hundreds of hours in the game and still not having seen the full potential of the systems and mechanics powering the game. As such, I really cannot wait for the Early Access version to release and be able to spend more time with a game that I feel I will be playing for a very, very long time</em>.</p>
