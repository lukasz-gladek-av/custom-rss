			<p>Sucker Punch Productions is one of the longest-standing PlayStation Studios teams, with a storied history and more than a few series and characters who've taken the PlayStation spotlight over the years. During the PlayStation 3 era, that series was Infamous, a series of games that spilled over into the PlayStation 4 era, but has been dormant since the release of a main game and a shorter DLC title that both arrived at the beginning of the PS4 generation. </p>



<p>Infamous was followed up with<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/"> Ghost of Tsushima,</a> a decision that very few, if any, would question, considering how successful Ghost of Tsushima has been, both as a commercial product and as a game that is beloved by players and critics alike. But that hasn't stopped players who loved Infamous from wondering out loud if Sucker Punch would return to the series. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story">GameInformer</a>, where creative directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell were talking all things Ghost of Yotei ahead of the game's October release, Fox was asked if he'd be open to going back to the Infamous games. </p>



<p>"<em>I would love to work on more Infamous</em>," Fox began. "<em>I would love to see a trilogy rerelease, but Sucker Punch is a one game at a time shop, and right now we are very focused on finishing Ghost of Yotei.</em>"</p>



<p>For as long as Sucker Punch has been making games for PlayStation consoles, the studio has focused on one series at a time. On the PlayStation 2, that series was Sly Cooper. It made three Sly Cooper games for PS2 before the series spilled over into the PS3 generation with another developer at the helm. Then it was Infamous with two games made for PS3, one for PS4, and one shorter, expansion-sized game, also for PS4.</p>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima was undoubtedly the studio's main game for the PS4 generation. The 'Ghost' series is only the second time in the studio's history that it has worked on games in a series that has straddled two console generations, but what Sucker Punch has never done so far is look back. As a fan of Infamous myself, I would love to see them return to the series, rerelease the trilogy and make a proper fourth installment, but I can't say that feels likely. </p>



<p>Who knows, though. Perhaps Fox, I, and many players around the world who still have a love for the Infamous games will get our wish.</p>

			<p>FromSoftware, the development studio behind the Souls series and the wildly successful Elden Ring, is deep into the development of an unannounced project that could launch in 2026.</p>



<p>According to a new report posted on <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">MP1st</a>, the Japanese development studio is working on multiple projects at this time, including updates for Elden Ring Nightreign, the Nintendo Switch 2 game <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> and a third, unannounced multiplatform project codenamed <em>"FMC"</em>. This project is expected to be in an advanced state of development, and should release no later than next year, if there are no delays. Sadly, the codename doesn't tell us much about the project, but as the report noted, projects belonging to the Dark Souls and Armored Core series traditionally have codenames starting with F, so the new project could be related to either series.</p>



<p>If the unannounced project being developed by FromSoftware is indeed related to the Dark Souls series, it will be very interesting to see what it will be. In the past, series creator and studio's president Hidetaka Miyazaki said that the series was done, so it could be either a spin-off or a remaster. In the latter case, it would probably be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster/">rumored remaster</a> of the third entry in the series, as both the first and the second entries in the series have already been remastered.</p>



<p>The aforementioned Elden Ring Nightreign is the latest game released by FromSoftware, a co-op game which masterfully combines the mechanics of Elden Ring and the Souls series with some roguelite elements. You can learn more about the game now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>
