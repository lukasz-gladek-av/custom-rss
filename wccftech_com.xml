			<p>Arrowhead's Helldivers 2 made a big splash at launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling</a> over 12 million units between PC and PlayStation 5 in its first three months on the market. Player numbers dwindled afterward due to a few underwhelming patches, but they have since risen back slightly.</p>
<p>In a year without standard-setting game releases, it is not that surprising to see that Helldivers 2 managed to win the Game of the Year award (as well as the Best Visual Design and Best Technical Innovation categories) at the yearly TIGA Awards, hosted last week at Shoreditch Town Hall in London by the UK's games industry trade association.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Richard Wilson OBE, CEO of TIGA, stated: The TIGA Games Industry Awards 2024 showcase the incredible talent, innovation, and passion that define the UK games industry. Our Awards recognise excellence in studios of all sizes, super service providers and outstanding educational institutions. Congratulations to all the winners, nominees, and the entire community for making this such a vibrant and pioneering industry. Your achievements set the stage for an exciting 2025 in the UK games sector. I would also like to say a very special ‘thank you’ to our generous sponsors, who make the Awards possible.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Helldivers 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellblade II</a> also managed to snatch a couple of awards. You can find the full list of winners below.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has seen the addition of two major patches, bringing in over 650 fixes, which target bugs, crashes, and mission-specific problems.</p>
<p>GSC Game World has apparently acknowledged the widespread bugs that have ruined the experience for many players, and the developers are looking quite active in pushing out "effective" patches that include a large set of fixes. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474617?l=english">Patch 1.0.1</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474746?l=english">Patch 1.0.2</a> were released in quick succession by GSC Game World, with the first one mainly dealing with improving the A-Life system, along with several optimizations, while the latter one targeted bug fixes for six different missions.</p>
