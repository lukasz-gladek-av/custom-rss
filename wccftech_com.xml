            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-microsd-m-2-adapter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 MicroSD Express to M.2 open-source adapter is in the works, potentially allowing users to get more storage space at a lower price.</p>
<p>The project's <a href="https://github.com/NVNTLabs/switch2-SDEX2M2/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, which was launched this week, provided the first information on the process, revealing that such an adapter is made possible because the console's MicroSD Express slot supports the SD Express 7.1 standard, which exposes a true PCIe Gen3 x1 interface and utilizes the NVMe protocol for communication. As such, the adapter maps PCIe x1 from the Switch 2’s MicroSD Express slot to a standard M.2 2230 NVMe SSD, and no protocol translation is required as the Nintendo Switch 2 host controller handles everything.</p>
<p>Currently, the project's development seems to be proceeding smoothly, and the team is actively developing the PCB layout and testing. While the adapter, on paper, should be working without any issue, the team warns that there's the possibility of power-related issues related to the power draw of the M.2 SSD, which could be more than the Nintendo Switch 2 could handle, so a basic level of power filter has been added to hopefully establish a connection. Still, it is advised only to use low-voltage M.2 2230 NVMe drives and not attempt to use the adapter on legacy MicroSD slots, such as those of the original Nintendo Switch systems.</p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 will not be remembered as an innovative gaming system, it is an excellent console and a clear upgrade from its predecessor. You can learn more about the new generation system from Nintendo in Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode.1214229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the main advancements of the Nintendo Switch 2 is its support for High Dynamic Range displays. This works in both handheld mode, thanks to the console's own display, and TV mode, when the console is connected to an external display.</p>
<p>Granted, the console's display was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> to be severely lacking in HDR capabilities. The edge-lit LCD can only output 450 nits at maximum, which is nowhere near what's needed to display a proper HDR image. Moreover, being an LCD, the Nintendo Switch 2 display cannot provide anywhere near the same contrast level as an OLED display.</p>
<p>This limitation will only be overcome when the inevitable OLED Switch 2 releases in the future. Meanwhile, users can still access a better HDR experience in TV mode, provided they have a capable HDR display. However, Nintendo's HDR calibration settings menu isn't exactly user friendly.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhFXc_iKIMg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> out by YouTuber My Life in Gaming, after adjusting the peak brightness setting, there is another prompt that can be triggered with the Y button that brings the user to another brightness slider. This is, however, the paper white slider, which is completely different than the peak brightness slider, as HDR-savvy users already know.</p>
<p>As such, if your HDR is overblown, tweaking this setting may help. The YouTuber brought the slider below the midpoint and noticed improvements in midtones, shadows, and even menus with HDR enabled in Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hidden Switch 2 Setting Fixes HDR Calibration! / MY LIFE IN GAMING" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhFXc_iKIMg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another 'tip' is that you should always enable HGIG in your display's options. The HDR Gaming Interest Group was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr-gaming-interest-group-formed-optimize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> nearly seven years ago to optimize HDR gaming content across various displays. When HGIG is enabled, a display's dynamic tone mapping is disabled, preserving the creator's intent and delivering an optimal HDR image.</p>
<p>Granted, even with these two tweaks, Nintendo's first-party games don't look that much better in HDR on the Nintendo Switch 2. It's clear they still have to learn how to optimize their games for the format. Still, you'll get the optimal HDR image for third-party games.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 will launch later this month, introducing returning monster Lagiacrus, new features, and balance changes to the game.</p>
<p>The game's second major update has yet to receive a precise launch date, but it's been confirmed on the game's official Japanese X account that it will be released at the end of June. Full patch notes will be coming closer to the update's launch, but we already know the update will introduce Monster Hunter Tri's beloved monster Lagiacrus, which is expected to be somewhat reworked like it was in Generations due to the lack of underwater combat, a layered weapon system and some balance changes for specific weapons, including hammer and dual blades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="ja">【タイトルアップデート第2弾は今月末に配信予定！】</p>
<p>タイトルアップデート第2弾は、6月末の配信を予定しています。</p>
<p>追加モンスターをはじめ、「武器の重ね着装備」の実装などの追加要素や、ディレクターレターにてアナウンスさせていただいている各種調整改善などを予定しております。…</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched earlier this year on PC and consoles, and has definitely moved the series' formula forward by introducing some open-world mechanics that allow hunters to always stay out in the field and go after the monsters that appear on the maps as time passes. You can check out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review</a> to learn why I think the latest entry in the series is one of the best Monster Hunter games to date.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Independent developer VOID Interactive announced the console launch date for its tactical first-person shooter game Ready or Not. The game will debut on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009213" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>&nbsp;and Xbox Series S|X on July 15 in three editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition ($49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99) - Base Game</li>
<li>Day One Edition ($49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99) - Base Game and Pre-Order Bonus: M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol, 590M Shotgun</li>
<li>Deluxe Edition ($69.99 / £59.99 / €69.99) - Base Game, Home Invasion DLC, Dark Waters DLC, Unannounced DLC3, Official Ready or Not Soundtrack, Pre-Order Bonus: M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol, 590M Shotgun</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dark Waters DLC and Home Invasion DLC are also available for separate purchase at $9.99 / £7.99 / €9.99 each.</p>
<p>Chris Stone, Studio General Manager at VOID Interactive, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>This is a major milestone for everyone involved in the development of Ready or Not, from our initial development phase, to early access days, through to PC 1.0 and now consoles. Our amazing community has played a pivotal role in helping us shape this next chapter for Ready or Not and we wouldn’t be here without their valued feedback at all stages of development. We can’t wait to welcome our brand new console audience to Los Suenos and to share in their excitement this summer.</em></p>
<p>The console versions come with 18 single player or co-op missions (up to five players) and 2 new missions as part of the Los Sueños Stories free DLC update that will be released for free on PC on the same day. The Dark Waters and Home Invasion DLC bring 6 additional levels, and in Dark Waters DLC, there's also the UH-60 support Helicopter.</p>

<p>The game was in early access on PC for several years. It finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> its full launch in December 2023. As of last month, Ready or Not had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over nine million units to date. Needless to say, VOID Interactive is looking to break that ten million milestone with the help of console gamers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of our series of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviews</a> on the new Nintendo Switch 2 console (which we just reviewed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, by the way), we've got a new developer Q&amp;A with Koei Tecmo about their upcoming game WILD HEARTS S.</p>
<p>This is a new version of Wild Hearts, the monster hunting game that Koei Tecmo's Omega Force studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in February 2023 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. One of the main changes compared to the previous version is that the maximum player count for cooperative gameplay has been increased from three to four players. We interviewed Producer Takuto Edagawa to learn more about this version, including the studio's first thoughts on the Nintendo Switch 2 console, which they believe to be closer to the Xbox Series S than the PlayStation 4 in overall power.</p>
<p>WILD HEARTS S is now available to pre-order both digitally and physically ahead of the planned launch date of July 25. The game will feature voices in Japanese, English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish, with texts in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Polish.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: 4 Player Co-op Gameplay with Developer Commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uRpRwb2s-jY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you first receive your Nintendo Switch 2 development kit?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for asking, but I am unable to provide specifics.</p>
<p><strong>Fair enough! How long has WILD HEARTS S been in development, and what do you think about the new platform's ease of development?</strong></p>
<p>While I can't disclose how long it has been in development, I think that since we have built up experience with the Switch development environment, despite this being a brand new hardware launch, I think it was a pretty developer-friendly environment.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion?</strong></p>
<p>I'd have to go with the chat feature. It's become standard practice for hardcore gamers to use tools such as Discord to communicate while they play, but having this feature incorporated into the console allows more players to enjoy it as well. It might sound exaggerated, but I think this might have an impact on gaming culture as a whole.</p>
<p>WILD HEARTS S is a hunting game where multiplayer is really fun, and now with the increase from three to four players in multiplayer, it's even more important to coordinate with others, so I hope everyone will use the game chat feature to communicate with their friends and enjoy hunting together.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of raw computing power, is it closer to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox Series S?</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power so it's difficult to generalize, but I think it can be thought as closer to the Series S.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution for your game? Is it essentially the same as DLSS SR on PC?</strong></p>
<p>We're not using it for this game.</p>
<p><strong>What resolution and frame rate options are you offering for the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>Since it's before the game's launch, right now we're refraining from talking about the resolution and frame rate.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Hearts was originally only available for the new consoles. What were the challenges you faced when porting this game to the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware?</strong></p>
<p>We were able to handle the graphics quality and performance adjustments within the scope we had imagined. Especially in portable mode, the high quality LCD makes the graphics look smoother and more precise than the actual specs, which helped a lot.</p>
<p>However, even though this isn't particular to the Switch 2's processing power, we struggled with the processing in increasing multiplayer from 3 to 4 players. For the WILD HEARTS characters, we were very particular with the character creation feature and it is very robust, so adding an additional character was a huge challenge.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the Joy-Con 2 improvements? Are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are using HD Rumble. It allowed us to implement more nuanced vibration without additional costs for adjustments, so I feel that it is more powerful than the Switch.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about the Switch 2 version of your game?</strong></p>
<p>In WILD HEARTS S, players can use gimmicks known as 'karakuri' that can be instantly created on the field for a more innovative hunting experience. I would love to see many players enjoying the game, and I think of it as a step towards our next titles, so please invite your friends and happy hunting!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-gets-30-minute-gameplay-walkthrough/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-gets-30-minute-gameplay-walkthrough.1214100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-gets-30-minute-gameplay-walkthrough/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> the release date for Dying Light: The Beast, Techland also shared a large 30-minute gameplay walkthrough for the upcoming game. You can watch it below.</p>
<p>In this mission, protagonist Kyle Crane (who returns from the original Dying Light - check our interview with voice actor Roger Craig Smith <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) is investigating an old chemical factory south of the city, operated by a group known as the Baron’s men. This factory is the base for sinister experiments on Chimeras, mutated zombie creatures crucial to the game's plot.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Dying Light: The Beast stresses smart survival: simply put, not every encounter should be met with direct combat. For example, large groups of zombies known as Biters are best handled with distraction tactics like using decoys instead of fighting head-on.</p>
<p>In the mission seen in this Dying Light: The Beast gameplay walkthrough, Kyle, aided by a character named Olivia, follows clues leading to the abandoned factory. Here, he also faces the Virals, a faster type of zombie who is especially dangerous because they still maintain some human-like intelligence and behaviors. As in previous franchise entries, with dusk approaching, the impending night signals a dramatic increase in danger, ramping up the game's tension even further.</p>
<p>Abandoned buildings like the factory serve dual purposes: they are both potential traps and sources of valuable resources such as crafting materials and weapons. Attention to detail and careful exploration are vital for survival, with players encouraged to scour for hidden loot while constantly assessing the environment for threats. On that note, a&nbsp;new mechanic called Survivor Sense helps players identify enemies’ locations and types.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast also introduces a dynamic weather system, which adds realism and variety to the environments of Castor Woods but can pose additional challenges for the player. The game world is varied and includes multiple biomes such as swamps, national parks, and industrial zones, each with distinct visuals and gameplay dynamics. Furthermore, the open world will feel more dynamic thanks to raider activity outside the safe zones, producing emergent gameplay moments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Full 30 Minute Gameplay Walkthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZXdLBVg1Qk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eventually, Kyle steals a pickup truck, showing off how the addition of vehicles in Dying Light: The Beast provides enhanced mobility and ways to physically engage hordes. Of course, vehicles can be damaged, and there's the fuel scarcity to deal with.</p>
<p>The walkthrough concludes with Kyle confronting one of the aforementioned Chimeras, a massive mutated monster. It's here that we get to see Kyle's Beast meter, a special ability gauge that, once filled, allows him to unleash his Beast Mode, granting temporary superhuman powers he gained from all the experiments he was subjected to over the last thirteen years.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast launches on August 22 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
