			<p>MindsEye, the game developed by Build a Rocket Boy which launched this week on PC and consoles, is another Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can only hit 60 FPS at 4K resolution using NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation on one of the most powerful GPUs on the market.</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> takes a look at how the game developed by the studio founded by former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies runs on an RTX 5080 at 4K and 1440p resolution, two resolutions the GPU should be able to handle well in most titles. Unfortunately, the game is another Unreal Engine 5 GPU destroyer, as, at 4K resolution, MindsEye barely hits the 60 FPS mark only with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode and Frame Generation, and it's only with Multi Frame Generation that a sort of high refresh rate experience is achievable at that resolution. Things fare only marginally better at 1440p resolution, but seeing the game running only at around the 60 FPS mark at native resolution suggests how no other GPU on the market besides the beast that is the RTX 5090 can properly handle the game in its current state.</p>

<p>No one who followed MindsEye until its release should be surprised to see that the game is launching with plenty of issues. Right before launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two Build a Rocket Boy chief executives left the studio</a>, and it was widely reported by those who got early copies on consoles that the game was in a very rough state, which the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">major day one patch</a> improves only marginally.</p>
<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>It will be a while until the doors of the Nintendo Switch 2 are open to actual mods and homebrew software, but even so, it's already possible to mod certain backward-compatible titles to run at max graphics settings and increased framerate.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> showcases Grid Autosport and Alien Isolation running with graphics mods. The first game runs at 60 FPS in Quality Mode at 1080p resolution without dynamic resolution scaling, MSAA x8, Anisotropic Filtering 16x, maxed graphics settings, and a performance overlay that highlights how the Nintendo Switch 2 handles the racing game with maxed out settings. Alien Isolation, on the other hand, runs at 1080p resolution with disabled dynamic resolution scaling and all graphics settings maxed. Unfortunately, the framerate cap couldn't be disabled with the method used by the modder, which involves importing a modded save file where graphics settings have been changed, something that can be done with all games by Feral Interactive, as they all seem to do the same.</p>
<p><iframe title="Graphics Mods on Switch 2 - 60FPS Unlock / Max Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LCVzZTDxdJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 being so popular, having already become <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">Nintendo's fastest-selling system to date at launch</a>, it's not surprising to see people already tinkering with the system to discover what can be done outside of what the manufacturer intended. With overclocking and increased RAM, the original system could run <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-above-60-fps/">demanding games at higher resolutions and more stable framerates</a>, so it will be very interesting to see if something similar can be achieved on the new generation system once modders get full access to it, which is something that will inevitably happen, no matter how much Nintendo will try to prevent it.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now out worldwide, with a few exceptions. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
