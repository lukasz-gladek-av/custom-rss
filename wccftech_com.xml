			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 dock has arrived today, thanks to some new pictures shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2dH7Za0#n35dYx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new pictures</a>, which have been shared online by the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4119">Famiiboards forums</a>, provide a new look at the console's dock, highlighting some of the changes over the current dock, including what looks like a grid on the base of the dock, which suggests a change in the cooling and air intake over the current model.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-awaited reveal last month, Nintendo has kept pretty silent about its new system and will likely continue to do so until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>. According to a former Nintendo employee, the event won't only go over the Nintendo Switch 2 features that were briefly teased in the reveal trailer, but will also likely confirm the console's release date, which is speculated to be sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">June</a> for a few reasons, so there's the chance that we won't have to wait much longer to learn when it will finally launch worldwide.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches this year. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>A new Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition trailer was shared online today, providing a new look at the game's mechanics and features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioWlTKzw2VM">The new overview trailer</a>, which can be watched below, is an excellent introduction to the game, as it goes over its most important features, like exploration and traversal, the combat system, the armored vehicles Skells, online features, and more. The trailer also has something for those who played the game on Wii U, as it provides a new look at the additional story content of the Definitive Edition, which includes a new location to explore, new characters, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Everything you need to know about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioWlTKzw2VM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is setting out to be the best way to enjoy the game developed by Monolith Soft, thanks to its visual improvements and updated interface that make it easier to get into what can be a very overwhelming game, even for veterans of the series. You can learn more about what the game offers in its first ten or so hours by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hands-on-impressions/">preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition doesn’t feel like a particularly radical upgrade through its first 10-or-so hours, but some UI updates and a limited visual makeover ought to make the game more approachable for the large majority of Switch owners who missed out on it the first time around. I still have a lot more to try out, including the game’s teased new content, but so far, it feels like X still marks the spot.</em></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches on Nintendo Switch on March 20th worldwide.</p>
