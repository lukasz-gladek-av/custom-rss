			<p>NVIDIA announced that the Borderlands franchise (with the exception of the spin-off Tiny Tina's Wonderlands) is now available to stream on its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. As you might recall, publisher 2K was among those companies that <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-games-is-the-latest-publisher-to-remove-its-lineup-from-geforce-now-while-epic-games-vows-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulled out of GeForce NOW</a> when the service first launched out of beta in early 2020.</p>
<p>Something must have changed recently, though. The Mafia franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> GeForce NOW last month, and now it's time for Gearbox's first-person looter shooter games. Moreover, the upcoming Borderlands 4 will be available to stream on day one. Its system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren't that high</a>, but it's still welcome news.</p>
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization franchise is already available on GFN, but BioShock, X-COM, and the sports games (NBA, WWE, Top Spin, PGA Tour) aren't. Will they be the next 2K franchises to join GeForce NOW? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, here's the full list of GFN additions for this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>REMATCH (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 16)</li>
<li>Broken Arrow (New release on Steam, June 19)</li>

<li>Date Everything! (New release on Steam, June 17)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 17)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a> (New release on Steam, Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, June 17)</li>
<li>Architect Life: A House Design Simulator (New release on Steam, June 19)</li>

<li>Torque Drift 2 (Epic Games Store)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, there are several GeForce NOW promotions in full swing for the Summer Sale, such as 40% discounts on a six-month Performance membership or a <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-40-discount-on-performance-day-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance day pass</a> to try out the cloud gaming service before committing to a more extended subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-reportedly-put-up-for-sale-by-pearl-abyss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>On September 6, 2018, South Korean game developer Pearl Abyss (Black Desert) <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> CCP Games and the MMORPG EVE Online, the flagship product of the Icelandic studio, for around $425 million.</p>
<p>Nearly seven years later, Pearl Abyss might be reconsidering their stake in CCP Games. At least, that's what <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report by Korean website MTN</a> alleges today: PA has reportedly reached out to multiple game companies to gauge their potential interest in acquiring CCP Games.</p>
<p>We don't have public visibility on the sales performance of CCP's games, but we do know that there were several missteps along the way, both prior and after the acquisition by Pearl Abyss. Over its nearly thirty-year history, CCP canceled at least four games (an MMO set in the World of Darkness, Project Legion, Eve: The Second Genesis, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Nova</a>), while other projects notoriously fizzled too early, such as Dust 514. For a while, CCP even released several Virtual Reality games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/196685-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE: Valkyrie</a>, Gunjack, Gunjack 2: End of Shift, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sparc-virtual-sport-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparc</a>), although eventually it gave up once it became crystal clear that the VR market was too small.</p>
<p>More recently, CCP <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-frontier-goes-public-today-with-founder-access-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> EVE: Frontier, a survival spin-off of EVE Online, in 'Founder Access'. Perhaps Pearl Abyss isn't thrilled with the direction of Frontier and the other new project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-frontier-vanguard-fanfest-2025-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a>, CCP's umpteenth at a shooter game connected with its MMORPG.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the MTN report alleges that the Korean company would be glad to be rid of this subsidiary and focus on its own games, such as Crimson Desert and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DokeV</a>. This is the same source that <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a tentative internal release date for Crimson Desert, by the way, to which Pearl Abyss only referred back to official announcements coming from its own social channels.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we'll update this article if PA chooses to comment in any way. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-nvidia-dlss-4-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Battlefield Labs update has gone live today, introducing new features to the test version of what will presumably be the next entry in the popular first-person shooter series.</p>
<p>As reported on the franchise's official subreddit, the new patch that went live a few hours ago introduced a few changes and improvements, such as NVIDIA DLSS 4 support and the option to turn off the border around the capture zone. Additionally, the new update has changed the watermark from PRE ALPHA to ALPHA and has added files related to a battle royale mode. With the promise of news coming soon regarding the class system, there's the chance the update has been pushed in preparation for something, possibly the official announcement of the next Battlefield which is still scheduled for this <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">summer.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lf7tkr/new_information_dropped_from_the_1bf_telegram/">New information dropped from the 1BF telegram</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NSGXD/">u/NSGXD</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although Battlefield Labs footage was not meant to be shared, plenty of it has made its way <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-new-leaked-footage/">online,</a> providing an early look at what the next entry in the series should offer. Besides the multiplayer modes that select users can test right now, the next entry in the series will also feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/">single-player campaign</a> developed by Motive Studios, the team behind last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/">Dead Space remake</a>, which will be influenced by TV shows and movies like Lioness and Civil War.</p>
<p>More information on Battlefield Labs can be found on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-has-just-become-more-challenging-with-the-introduction-of-the-everdark-sovereigns/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has just become more challenging, thanks to the introduction of a more powerful variant of the Nightlords.</p>
<p>Following the release of the game's latest minor update mainly focused on fixing bugs, Nightfarers will now encounter <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everdark Sovereigns</a> during Expeditions. Over the next few weeks, they can take on more powerful variants of the Gaping Jaw, Sentient Pest, and Darkdrift Knight bosses, with other Everdark Sovereigns getting added to the game later. Every week, a new Sovereign will arrive in Limveld for everyone who has already defeated the base version of the boss, and when the time is up, they will disappear. Those who manage to take down these limited-time versions of the Nightlords will be rewarded with Sovereign Sigils that can be exchanged for special Relics and other items. The first Everdark Sovereign, an enhanced version of Adel, Baron of the Night, will be available until June 26 9:59 JST 2:59 CEST 5:59 PM PDT.</p>
<p>Considering there isn't much to do in Elden Ring Nightreign after defeating the game's final boss, the introduction of more powerful Nightlords is more than welcome. Not that the game needed more challenge, as some of the base Nightlords are among the most challenging bosses created by FromSoftware, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-update-20-1-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-introducing-stability-improvements-and-more.1222908/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-update-20-1-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is now live, introducing general stability improvements as well as undocumented improvements.</p>
<p>The official update notes don't leave any doubt regarding the fact that this is a minor update, as it only introduces <em>"general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience."</em> What's more interesting is that the update reportedly does introduce some undocumented improvements. As reported by well-known dataminer OatmealDome on <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the new update improves backward compatibility, and some previously unsupported titles are now properly playable on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While not a direct effect of the new system update, Pikmin 3 Deluxe now properly works on the new system, thanks to a new <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935510351015006422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> that addressed screen flickering issues. The demo version of the game will also be fixed later.</p>
<p>Backward compatibility seems to be one of the best features of the Nintendo Switch 2, so it wouldn't be surprising to see improvements already being made so soon. Multiple tests have confirmed that even<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/"> unpatched games</a> can take advantage of the new system's better specs to deliver more stable framerates, so hopefully, more of the incompatible titles will become fully playable on the system in the future.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a massive improvement over its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
