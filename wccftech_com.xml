			<p>The Epic Games Store's New Year's Gift is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> from Warhorse Studios. You've got until 5 PM today to permanently add it to your library. Like Christmas's gift, <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy's Control</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance was also previously featured as a freebie <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-free-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early 2020</a>. Likewise, just as Control, in case you didn't grab it at the time, you absolutely should do it now.</p>
<p>For one thing, it'll get you prepared for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>, which is scheduled to launch in just a month. That's around the right amount of time you'll need to complete, as just the main story requires over 40 hours of gameplay on average. If you add side content, it's easily going to double that figure. This is just the base game, mind you - there are also a few DLCs, which you can <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance--royal-dlc-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grab for $3.99</a> (with an 80% discount) with the ongoing Holiday sale.</p>
<p>Originally funded via Kickstarter, Kingdom Come Deliverance has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over eight million units to date. It is a first-person roleplaying game set in a fully historical setting, 1403 Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic), at the time of King Wenceslaus IV. This would already be enough to make the game stand out from most RPGs. Adding to that, the main character, Henry of Skalitz, is the mere son of a blacksmith. And no, he never gets magic powers or anything like that.</p>
<p>It's all quite realistic, and so are the missions, which sometimes ask the player to perform regular chores as would be required for a relatively lowly person in the medieval ages. Even so, Warhorse managed to make it feel fun on most occasions, although you'll definitely need a greater deal of patience than in most RPGs, especially as you learn the unique direction-based combat system. The characters are very well-written, and some scenes are absolutely memorable.</p>

			<p>When Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed down</a> Tango Gameworks alongside Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Studios (the latter was actually rolled into ZeniMax Online Studios), the industry did not hide its displeasure.</p>
<p>The Japanese developer didn't deserve such a fate, especially after delivering the universally acclaimed rhythm action game Hi-Fi Rush, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-wins-navgtr-goty-marvels-spider-man-2-and-hi-fi-rush-win-7-and-6-prizes-respectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won several awards last year</a>. On Wccftech, the game earned a 9 out of 10 score from reviewer Ule Lopez:</p>
<p><em>Hi-Fi Rush is a fantastic game that combines two very popular genres and makes a wonderful and innovative game with a low skill floor but a high skill ceiling. The game is both accessible to newcomers to rhythm games and very challenging for veterans looking to be tested in several other areas that don't necessarily have to do with just rhythm games. The combat is varied, the combos you learn are great to execute, and the music is a joy to listen to. Overall, a great success.</em></p>
<p>It was even more baffling because Microsoft had previously stated they wanted to add more Asian developers to their first-party roster. Regardless, it was not the end for Tango Gameworks, as PUBG maker Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swooped in</a> to acquire the studio and the Hi-Fi Rush intellectual property. In September, Krafton CEO Han 'CH' Kim said they know a sequel probably wouldn't sell a lot due to being a niche genre, but they would still try to do their best for fans.</p>
<p>Today, at the dawn of the new year, Tango Gameworks has r<a href="https://x.com/TangoGameworks/status/1874259495783981205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">esumed social media communications</a> with the following message to all its fans:</p>
<p><em><strong>A New Start </strong></em><br>
<em>Tango Gameworks studio has been reborn as Tango Gameworks Inc., proudly joining KRAFTON Inc. </em><br>
<em>We're excited to continue crafting games that bring joy to players around the world. </em><br>
<em>Thank you for your continued support as we embark on this new journey!</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the Japanese studio previously also released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-evil-within-review-lackluster-horror-forgotten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Evil Within</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-evil-within-2-good-not-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Evil Within 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostwire-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a>. Those franchises have stayed with Microsoft for now, but they don't appear to be&nbsp;used for the time being. As such, it's not inconceivable that Tango might ask for the license at some point in the future, though the current focus is undoubtedly on Hi-Fi Rush 2.</p>
