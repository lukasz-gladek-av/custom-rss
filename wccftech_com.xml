			<p>MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries - Shadows of Kerensky is a new DLC coming soon to the mech shooter game. Developer Piranha Bytes announced that it will be released at some point in September for $19.99. The DLC will take place during the Clan invasion, although it is focused on the perspective of a mercenary company, unlike <a href="https://wccftech.com/mechwarrior-5-clans-is-out-on-october-3-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MechWarrior 5: Clans</a>, which launched in October 2024.</p>



<p>The player's mercenary group is hired by the Rasalhague Republic to hold the line against an overwhelming new enemy. What starts as a routine mission quickly becomes a desperate fight for survival. Secrets tied to the past and the Clans' origins are uncovered along the way. Players will experience a handcrafted, 12-mission story campaign that brings them face-to-face with the Clan invasion, fighting iconic factions. Piranha is promising cinematics, briefings, and high-stakes missions throughout the narrative campaign.</p>



<p>New contracts also emerge as the battle lines are redrawn, allowing the Mercs to take on high-risk missions near Clan territory, where constant patrols and danger lurk around every corner. In MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries - Shadows of Kerensky, players face off against 16 powerful OmniMechs, but they can then add cutting-edge firepower to their own hangar, unleashing Clan weapons and equipment to tip the odds in their favor. There are also going to be new Inner Sphere weapons, thirteen new variants, and the Bullshark. Lastly, players will be able to recruit brand new elite MechWarriors with unique abilities.</p>



<p>As a reminder, just like the base MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries, this DLC is powered by Unreal Engine 4, unlike MechWarrior 5: Clans, which was made with Unreal Engine 5.</p>
