			<p>Today is Dragon Age Day, and BioWare is celebrating the yearly event with a few gifts for the community. To begin with, they have finally released the free Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creator as a standalone app available on all platforms. Fans had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-might-be-released-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested</a> it before launch to get a head start on creating their characters, but the developers couldn't release it in time. It's now out there, though, and everyone will be able to download the character creation tool, make their characters, and then import them into the game.</p>
<p>BioWare also prepared a special image that collects some of the Rooks shared by the community from the game's launch to this day. The picture shows the great diversity available in the character creation tool.</p>

<p>There's more. Today, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is getting its fourth update, introducing a new tool to take photos of the game's cutscenes, over 20 bug fixes, and new Qunari complexions.&nbsp;For Dragon Age Day 2024, BioWare has also released a free armor, body paint, and nose blood smear based on Dragon Age II protagonist Hawke, the Champion of Kirkwall. Owners of Dragon Age: The Veilguard can find the new cosmetics in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing the mission 'The Singing Blade.' Check out a preview below.</p>

<p>BioWare has released a few infographics detailing some of the choices made by the players in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. For example, in the first real opportunity to choose the fate of a character, 42% left Mayor Julius of D'Meta's Crossing to drown in Blight, while 36% saved him. The remaining 22% banished him to the Grey Wardens. Notably, this option was only available to Grey Wardens Rooks, which partly explains the lower percentage. It's also by far the best option (and the one I picked in my playthrough) since Julius later has his own redemption by helping save a group of Grey Wardens in the Hossberg Wetlands.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours, to properly cap off Dragon Age Day, a few members of the development team will also participate in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit AMA</a> (Ask Me Anything) session to answer questions from the community.</p>
