			<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has released the highly anticipated Helldivers 2: Heart of Democracy update on both PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>After fighting for democracy across the galaxy, players have swiftly been recalled back to Super Earth, where they'll have to fight against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-galactic-emergency-announced-new-enemies-and-weapon-customizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invading Illuminate</a>, a faction formed by an aquatic species known as Squ'ith. Super Earth Armed Forces had nearly annihilated them, but in secret, they built a fleet called The Great Host, which is now invading Super Earth.</p>
<p>In a major change of environment from the usual planet, Helldivers will fight among towering skyscrapers and crowded streets while the Illuminate rain down destruction all around. Inside the city biomes, players must tackle operations and work to liberate cities together, having a significant impact on planetary campaigns. They must fight to control areas where the fleet is landing, in what Arrowhead has described as a game of intergalactic tug-of-war, struggling against the incoming forces, with the potential to gain and lose control quickly.</p>
<p>Helldivers will find help in the Super Earth Armed Forces troops, who fight on their own but can be ordered to follow players and provide temporary backup as they navigate toward objectives. The ultimate goal is to activate Super Earth's Planetary Defense Cannons to take down the Illuminate fleet. However, Helldivers must also be aware of the many civilians still roaming the streets, fearing for their lives. Any civilian lives lost from friendly fire will be punished.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 was just updated with a new and powerful primary weapon customization system. Most primary weapons now have levels that can be achieved by completing missions. These levels unlock new attachments that can be obtained through Requisition. Players can also unlock weapon patterns.</p>
<p>The weapon customization system allows tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazine capacity, optimizing weapon performance characteristics with muzzle adjustments, or customizing under-barrel attachments for optimal handling.</p>
