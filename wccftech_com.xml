			<p>Continuing a process that began with Monster Hunter World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> attempts to further streamline the series formula to reduce the time players spend in menus and at the base camp to keep them on the field as much as possible, providing them with all the tools they need to effortlessly traverse the new open-world maps.</p>
<p>Among these new tools the game provides is the Seikret, a friendly Bird Wyvern that assists Hunters by giving them access to Supply items and an additional weapon while making traversal way faster than on foot. Unlike Monster Hunter Rise's Palamutes, which served a similar traversal purpose, however, Seikret don't really feel good to control due to some default control settings that the game never really explains unless the player goes through them manually.</p>

<p>The settings you will want to change as soon as you begin your adventure in Monster Hunter Wilds are the Call Seikret Controls (Radial Menu), and the Seikret Manual Controls found on the second page of the Controls menu in the main Options menu. The first one is, by default, set to Auto-move, which puts the Seikret into Auto-move after calling it from either a shortcut or the Radial Menu, which makes the Bird Wyvern head towards any highlighted target, whether it is a resource you have highlighted yourself on the map or any target monster. This option is far from being the best, as it wrestles control away from the player upon calling the Seikret, and having to press buttons to slow it down and make it stop feels clunky and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The Seikret Manual Controls option is even more important to change to have better control of the Seikret. The default option, Type 1, makes the Seikret move without player input, similar to Auto-move, as pressing nothing maintains the current speed, while additional button presses are required to slow it down and make it stop. Type 2 is a much, much better option in pretty much every scenario, as the Seikret will only move with directional inputs without needing additional button presses to change the beast's speed, just like controlling the Hunter. And if you still want the Seikret to bring you to your target automatically, you can still activate Auto-move at any time, so changing the Seikret controls this way will provide you with the best traversal options the game has to offer for all sorts of situations. If you're so used to how you call the Palamute in Monster Hunter Rise, you can also change the Call Seikret Controls option so as to be able to call the Seikret by holding the circle/B button with your weapon sheated.</p>
