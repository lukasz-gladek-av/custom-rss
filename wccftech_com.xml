			<p>The function of the Nintendo Switch 2 new Joy-Con controller C button has yet to be officially revealed, but there's the chance that we will get to celebrate the unexpected return of the Wii U console when it will, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s"> eXstas1s</a>, who proved to be an overall reliable insider in the past, revealed that, according to their sources, the C button will be used, among other things, to connect the Nintendo Switch 2 to an original Switch console to use it as a controller or an additional screen, essentially turning the previous generation console into something akin to the Wii U GamePad. As not every Nintendo Switch 2 user may also be the owner of its predecessor, there's no doubt that this connectivity feature will be completely optional, but, on the other hand, it could open up some very interesting possibilities, such as proper emulation of Nintendo DS and 3DS games.</p>

<p>While eXstas1s has proven to be somewhat reliable in the past, we have to take this Nintendo Switch 2 rumor with a grain of salt until the C button functionality is officially revealed next week. At the same time, a patent that emerged online<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dual-screen-patent/"> earlier this month</a> suggested some sort of dual-screen functionality for the system, so the ability to use the original Switch as a second screen doesn't sound all that improbable.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches later this year worldwide. The console's release date is expected to be revealed next week during a dedicated Nintendo Direct.</p>
