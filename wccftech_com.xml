			<p>Today, Nintendo announced that its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/switch.html">second-best-selling Nintendo Switch game</a>, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 version, with graphical updates and features that take advantage of the Switch 2 and its improved hardware. Today's Animal Crossing news isn't just for Nintendo Switch 2 players; a new 3.0 title update is also on its way, which will be available to players on both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</p>



<p>The new Switch 2 version of Animal Crossing: New Horizons leans on the updated hardware for several updates, each shown off in a new trailer, which also goes over the features coming in the 3.0 title update. </p>



<p>Both the Switch 2 version of New Horizons and the 3.0 title update will be available on January 15, 2026, and if you already have New Horizons, you'll be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 edition of the game by purchasing an upgrade pack. The 3.0 title update is free for all players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When it comes to the graphical updates included in the Switch 2 edition of New Horizons, Nintendo doesn't exactly go into details, but does showcase that the Switch 2 version will look much sharper compared to what you get on Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>The more significant updates seem to be how New Horizons takes advantage of features like mouse controls on the Joy-Con 2 controllers and the microphone on Switch 2, which now lets you call out to your island guests to more easily find where they are. Also, rather than having eight players come and visit your island, you and eleven of your friends who were all wealthy enough to buy a Switch 2 can all play together with up to twelve players capable of visiting one island on the Switch 2 edition.</p>



<p>The free 3.0 title update meanwhile adds new amiibo functionality with compatible Legend of Zelda and Splatoon amiibos allowing players to add up to four new characters to their island, along with new items and furniture styles with which to decorate their island. There's also a new LEGO collaboration on the way which has a slew of LEGO items for players to decorate and use.</p>



<p>New Horizons also gets a new hotel with the 3.0 update, where players can run and unlock new items and outfits from, as you'll decorate the various rooms in the hotel to suit a guest's specific needs.</p>



<p>New Horizons launched in March 2020, and has since become one of the best-selling first-party games from Nintendo on the Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/">reviewed it at launch, we gave it a 9.4/10</a>, and what we wrote back then still stands: "<em>When I saw that I had played 40 hours of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I was shocked because it didn't feel like that long at all. And that's because it still has that Animal Crossing magic. I played for what felt like five minutes a day, but in reality was multiple hours of fishing, bug catching, material collecting, crafting, and more. I feel like a complete newbie still, like I have so much to do, so much more to learn, and I can't wait to see more. I have to. I'm going to continue playing, and build my perfect island. Animal Crossing: New Horizons has its hooks in me, and while I still don't know if it's my favorite Animal Crossing game, it's undoubtedly one of the best.</em>"</p>

Both games support the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA RTX Blackwell server upgrade</a>, which means Ultimate subscribers can enable NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to get the highest possible frame rates.</p>

<p>Lastly, NVIDIA announced a limited-time offer to celebrate the launch of ARC Raiders. Every purchase of a new 12-month GeForce NOW Ultimate membership will grant a digital copy of the extraction shooter, starting today and through Thursday, November 20. Just like Embark's previous game, The Finals, ARC Raiders also supports RTXGI to improve the game's global illumination. GeForce NOW users at the Performance and Ultimate tiers can enable the feature in the game's settings.</p>

			<p>The MMORPG AION 2 will launch globally in 2026 with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on the PC version (the game will also be available on mobile devices).</p>



<p>The initial launch in South Korea and Taiwan is set for November 19. The game is a sequel to Aion: The Tower of Eternity, which launched in 2008 in Korea and the following year worldwide. The original game was powered by Crytek's CRYENGINE, whereas this new installment is made with Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>Aion 2 takes place around two hundred years later and features a world that, according to NCSOFT, is 36 times larger. Moreover, unlike the “zoned” areas of the original, Aion 2 features a seamless, fully explorable world with no loading screens between vast regions. Players will once again choose between two factions, Elyos and Asmodian, which are eternally locked in conflict. However, unlike in the original game, they will be placed in separate servers, so the conflict between them will occur entirely in the Abyss. On this special PvP battlefield, the populations of two servers (one for Elyos and another for Asmodian players) will clash.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the developers have promised over 200 dungeons to explore that range from solo instances to group dungeons for up to eight players. Eight are also the classes available at launch: Gladiator, Templar, Assassin, Marksman, Sorcerer, Spiritmaster, Cleric, and Chanter.</p>

<p>The news was shared by NVIDIA as part of a press release highlighting the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/gamer-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce Gamer Festival</a>, which is live today at COEX in Seoul to celebrate 25 years of GeForce in South Korea. The MMORPG is playable at the event, just like NCSOFT's MMOTPS Cinder City, which we checked out at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an exclusive developer interview</a>.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared a brief update by KRAFTON on PUBG Ally, the 'co-playable character' powered by ACE <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at CES 2025</a>. PUBG Ally, which is powered by the small language model (SMM) Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k and enables AI teammates to support the player including even engaging in combat with other players, will host a 'user test event' early next year. </p>

			<p>Xbox gaming revenues have declined by $113 million, or 2%, due to drop in hardware sales and limited growth of gaming content and services in Q1 FY2026 over the prior year, Microsoft confirmed in its latest financial report.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the company reported its<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast"> Q1 FY2026 earnings</a>, confirming the Xbox hardware revenue 29% decline, which is offset in part by growth in Xbox content and services, whose $5.5 billion revenue is a 1% improvement over the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"strong prior year"</em>. This revenue increase was driven by growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content, and partially offset by a decline in first-party content.</p>



<p>Xbox hardware sales declining is hardly surprising, as console sales were already down 22% last quarter. With the current generation almost at the end, increasing prices, and a multiplatform strategy that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">bringing tentpole franchises like Halo to the PlayStation 5</a>, no improvement was to be expected. </p>



<p>Considering the above, it will be very interesting to see how much of a difference the next-generation Xbox will make. The new system will reportedly be <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a very premium experience</a> combining <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">the best of the PC and console worlds</a>, but its popularity could be severely impacted by its price, which is <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">expected to be much higher than the price of the PlayStation 6.</a></p>
