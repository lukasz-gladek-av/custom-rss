			<p>Releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> games on Game-Key Cards may be a forced choice for some developers due to raditional cartridges' technical limitations.</p>



<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, Ubisoft Snowdrop Engine audio architect Rob Bantin provided some interesting insight on why a developer may choose to release a game on a Game Key Card, revealing that the Switch 2 cartridges didn't give the performance needed at the quality target they were going for in the Star Wars Outlaws. The game is powered by the Snowdrop engine, which heavily relies on disk streaming for its open-world environments.</p>







<p>While this is a critical limitation, it shouldn't impact every Nintendo Switch 2 game moving forward. In a second message, the Snowdrop engine developer said that if a game is designed from the ground up for the system, the carts' performance limitations may not force a Game-Key card release, but as Star Wars Outlaws was built around the SSDs of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there was no choice but to release the game in Game-Key card format.</p>







<p>Judging from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws footage</a> released online so far, it seems like Ubisoft definitely made the right call, as even with some noticeable visual downgrades over the other versions of the game, the Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game is really solid, keeping a steady 30 FPS framerate even in open-world areas while also featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-early-footage-analysis-highlights-need-for-ray-reconstruction/">ray-traced effects</a>. Now that the console is out and its specs widely known, hopefully more developers will be able to work around some of the cartridges' technical limitations and release more proper retail releases, which Nintendo Switch 2 owners seem to love, looking at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/75-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical/">sales data of games like Cyberpunk 2077</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> shines on Nintendo Switch 2, which seems to provide a better handheld experience than the Steam Deck.</p>



<p>A new video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> compares the extremely successful second entry in the series by Team Cherry running on Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam Deck, highlighting how the two systems handle the game. The differences aren't massive, unsurprisingly, but they are big enough to make some players gravitate towards either of the systems, as the Nintendo Switch 2 offers a superior handheld experience thanks to its bigger screen with 120 FPS support, while the Steam Deck offers better versatility in docked mode, capable of pushing past 120 FPS with ease at multiple resolutions. The game's native support for the Steam Deck's 1280x800p resolution is also rather welcome, as well as the slightly faster load times, compared to the Switch 2 version. All in all, there's no clear winner, but for handheld play, it seems like Hollow Knight: Silksong is best experienced on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been in the works for a long time, and the almost complete silence Team Cherry held since the game's announcement only added to fan excitement, which literally exploded yesterday when <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-launch-19-99/">the game finally launched on PC and consoles</a>, overwhelming Steam and other digital stores as users rushed to download the game. Needless to say, the game is setting out to be a smashing success and of the most popular releases of the year, as it managed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">beat its predecessor's Steam concurrent users record in mere minutes.</a></p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library.</p>

			<p>A <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty</a> movie directed by Steven Spielberg could have been a thing, but Activision eventually refused the legendary director's pitch for a very specific reason.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-spielbergs-call-of-duty-pitch-phil-suns-exit-the-rock-rebrand-a-rotten-reckoning/">Puck News</a>, Steven Spielberg, who's a big gamer and a fan of the Call of Duty series, wanted to direct the movie based on the franchise, which sounded like a pretty great idea, considering how much some of his movies have influenced the franchise. Teaming up with Universal dealmaker Jimmy Horowitz, the director's team pitched his vision to Activision, which was reportedly spooked by the famous Spielberg deal, including top-market economics and full control over final cut, production and marketing. Instead, the publisher now owned by Microsoft went with David Ellison's pitch to retain more control over the movie, handing the production to Paramount.</p>



<p>Given the series's immense popularity, a Call of Duty movie was long overdue. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/">Announced earlier this week</a>, the first movie based on the Activision series could only be the beginning of a cinematic universe across film and television series, although, for the time being, the focus will be on this movie, whose director has yet to be announced.</p>



<p>The next entry in the series, which will be facing some serious competition this year with the highly anticipated Battlefield 6, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The game is primarily developed by Treyarch, with support from Raven Software for the campaign development, which promises to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-reveal-analysis/">shake things up quite a bit</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One on November 14.</p>

			<p>Although you will often have to fight the mutated creatures known as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-how-to-defeat-armored-tier-3-orphans/">Orphans</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> isn't all about combat. In true survival-horror fashion, the game also features various puzzles that will test your knowledge of the mechanics in puzzle-solving as much as in combat.</p>



<p>While making your way towards your target a few hours into the game, you will get to explore the <strong>Hardware Store</strong>, a once-thriving store destroyed by the effects of the Change plague, just like humanity seems to have been. Inside this location, which is easy to spot thanks to signs nearby, you will find a few items you will very much need to stay alive, but this isn't why this store is so important, as you will have to explore it fully to obtain a<strong> critical item needed to proceed in the main mission.</strong></p>



<p>After looking around inside a bit, you will notice that there's a door leading into some office that cannot be opened with keys or any other item. In reality, the door is blocked by Biomass, which you will have to get rid of to proceed. Doing so isn't as straightforward as it sounds, as the Biomass is located inside the office, and thus has to be <strong>burned from inside the room you need to get into.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The location of the gas can in the Cronos: The New Dawn Hardware Store</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>From the blocked door, if you head to the right and then to the left, you will find on your left again a window with a broken panel, allowing you to look inside, and more importantly, to shoot inside. <strong>Locate the gas can </strong>inside using the screenshot above as a guide, shoot it with your handgun and you will set the Biomass on fire, allowing you to finally open the door and enter the room. Inside, you will find the <strong>Bolt Cutter</strong> item you can use to open up the other locked door in the Hardware Store, as well as plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-should-you-bring-the-bolt-cutter-with-you/">other doors found all over New Dawn.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is a survival horror game inspired by some of the series that defined the genre like the Resident Evil and Dead Space, featuring almost every mechanic these series have introduced in the past years, such as limited resources, challenging fights against even the weakest of enemies, and <strong>locked doors that require The Traveler to locate keys and learn passcodes.</strong></p>



<p>During her journey, The Traveler will encounter the first locked door not long before awakening and heading towards her first target. This door is impossible to miss as it is right in your path, but you won't be able to open it as soon as you reach the storeroom, as you will need to input a passcode you have no way of knowing at this point.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The very first locked door you will encounter in Cronos: The New Dawn.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you ignore this locked door and proceed in your mission by following the waymarker, you will have to climb down some stairs and reach another big room where you will find some items and a rather<strong> unusual object you can interact with</strong>. This object actually stores a Travelog from another Travel, who will inform you the door in the room above can be opened by inputting the <strong>367</strong> code.</p>



<p>Although opening this door is not required to proceed in the main mission, you will want to backtrack a little to open it up and get the resources stored within. Cronos: The New Dawn is a little difficult in the first couple of hours, and you will need every help you can get to make it through some challenging fights. Also, consider holding onto the Energy you are gathering to purchase some <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">critical upgrades</a> that will help you even more during the beginning of the game.</p>
