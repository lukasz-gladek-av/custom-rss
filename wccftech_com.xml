			<p>NVIDIA DLSS support for the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to be a massive game-changer for the upcoming system, as the AI upscaler is already delivering impressive results upscaling low base resolutions to 1080p.</p>
<p>In a recent hands-on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> going over the system and both first and third-party games, the tech experts at Digital Foundry had the chance to try out the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Street Fighter 6, among other games. The game is the first taste of a game powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine on the system, and it seems like it delivers on all fronts, sporting stable 60 FPS gameplay in docked mode with some visual cutbacks in line with those featured in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox Series S versions over the others. More interesting, however, is that the game is not running at native 1080p resolution as early analysis of the available footage suggested, but at 1080p resolution upscaled from base 540p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS. Given how clean the image looks, this is extremely impressive.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter 6 Nintendo Switch 2 port is not the only impressive third-party port that will launch with the system in a little over two months. Much like the CAPCOM game, Cyberpunk 2077 has also been<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> confirmed</a> to use a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. The upscaler is reportedly used for all the game's display modes in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">exceptions</a>. You can learn more about the new system by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">report.</a></p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod that is now available for download for free addresses one of the game's most glaring issues.</p>
<p>The mod, which was developed by well-known modder Lyall, removes the 30 FPS cap in cutscenes, which is highly distracting when playing the game at higher framerates. The mod also fixes ultrawide resolutions FOV issues and introduces a few other features and improvements, such as the option to skip intro logos, enable the developer console, and disable letterboxing and pillar boxing in cutscenes. The mod, whose installation is quite simple, requiring the user only to drop the downloaded files into the game's folder, can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/ClairObscurFix">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game featuring a fascinating Belle Époque-inspired fantasy world, a charming cast of characters voiced by some incredible talent like Ben Starr, who previously voiced Clive Rosfield from Final Fantasy XVI and, more recently, general Khazan from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, and Jennifer English, who previously voiced Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3, and a turn-based combat system featuring some real-time elements like timed-button presses for increased skill power, dodging and parrying, that make confronting enemies extremely fun. The debut game from Sandfall Interactive is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. It is also available as part of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/"> GeForce NOW service library.</a></p>

			<p>Breath of Fire IV, the fourth entry in the classic JRPG series developed by CAPCOM, is now available on PC via GOG, complete with plenty of enhancements over the original PlayStation release.</p>
<p>The newly released PC version of the game, which launches 25 years after the original released on the first PlayStation in Japan, is now available for the price of $9.99 / €9.99 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a> and comes with improvements over the PlayStation release and the original PC release that launched in 2003, such as full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, 2 localization options (English and Japanese), new rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more), improved audio engine, improved keyboard and mouse support, fixed combat and cutscene scripting issues, full support for modern controllers and more.</p>
<p>The JRPG franchise by CAPCOM has been dormant for quite some time, so hopefully the Breath of Fire IV PC release will be successful enough to show the publisher how there's still interest in its series. Lately, CAPCOM has been bringing back series that were thought to be dead, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-hands-on-preview-aging-like-fine-wine/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">Okami</a> series, so a new game or a proper remaster of some of the older entries in the series, like my personal favorites, Breath of Fire III and Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, may not entirely be off the table.</p>
