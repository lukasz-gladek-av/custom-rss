			<p>It's apparently leak day in the games industry: after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-launch-date-is-march-5-xbox-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon launch date leak</a>, there's also the first in-game look at <strong>ZeniMax</strong>'s canceled <strong>Project Blackbird</strong>. Insider eXtas1s <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared it on X</a>, and Tom Henderson later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blackbrird-footage-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> it was real, adding that it was used internally to show off the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>-powered lighting. It is unclear whether the game was still running on Unreal Engine 4 when it was canceled, had already updated to Unreal Engine 5, or was planned to.</p>



<p>To be honest, that footage isn't very impressive. I'm not crazy on the character designs, for example. That said, it could be old, and of course, it doesn't tell us anything about how the game actually played. I've played a ton of <strong>The Elder Scrolls Online</strong> and was definitely looking forward to ZeniMax Online's new project, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that count, especially given the reports.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In November 2022, the game, based on a new intellectual property, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already been in development for <strong>over four and a half years</strong></a> and boasted a manpower of <strong>more than 200 employees</strong>. We didn't really hear anything further about Project Blackbird until <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly announced its cancellation in July 2025</a>, as part of a major round of layoffs that also affected <strong>Rare</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Everwild</strong> was canceled</a>) and <strong>The Initiative</strong> (the whole studio was shut down, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong> was canceled as well</a>).</p>



<p>A couple of days later, Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> had loved his hands-on time with the game just a few months ahead of the cancellation. The journalist also viewed some gameplay footage of Project Blackbird and confirmed it looked impressive. This backs up the public-facing statement of ZOS Lead Graphics Programmer Alex Tardif, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the new engine had found its footing and the game was heading in a 'great direction'.</p>



<p>Another report by TrueAchievements <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a few more details on the game itself</a>: it <span>would be a third-person online shooter in which players would become&nbsp;<strong>Revenants</strong>, bio‑enhanced operatives employed by alien syndicates to navigate the underworld of <strong>Soteria</strong>, a tidally-locked planet with</span> extreme biomes. Throughout Project Blackbird, players would rise through criminal/corporate ranks and uncover a murder conspiracy.</p>



<p>Former ZeniMax Online founder and studio head <strong>Matt Firor</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-blackbird-was-the-game-i-had-waited-my-entire-career-to-create-says-ex-zos-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> earlier this month that the cancellation of Project Blackbird led to his resignation, adding that this was the game he had waited his entire career to make. Following the cancellation, at least two different studios have been formed by the fired employees: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sackbird Studios</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ironroot-games-established-former-zenimax-online-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ironroot Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Nowadays, ZeniMax Online has returned to focus solely on <strong>The Elder Scrolls Online</strong>, recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-interview-free-content-battle-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealing a major shift to a seasonal model and free content updates</a>.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, the <strong>New York Videogame Critics Circle</strong> (NYVGCC) unveiled the winners of the <strong>2026 New York Game Awards</strong>, starting with Sandfall Interactive's <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, which won the top prize of best game of the year.</p>



<p>It's yet another meaningful award for the highly acclaimed single player JRPG, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the win at <strong>The Game Awards</strong> last month</a>. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already surpassed Baldur's Gate 3</a> as the third game to earn the most GOTY wins, and the award season is far from over, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 well-positioned to win other prizes, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"><strong>D.I.C.E. Awards</strong></a>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>, and our own Wccftech Awards, which will be announced imminently. It only lost to <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the <strong>Steam Awards</strong></a>, although those were voted on by the public.</p>



<p>Anyway, the so-called '<strong>Big Apple Award</strong>' wasn't the only one that the French developer brought home, so to speak. Jennifer English was once again recognized for her work as Maelle with the <strong>Great White Way Award</strong>, which rewards the Best Acting in a Game. Here's the rest of the prizes that were given during the 2026 New York Game Awards:</p>



<p><strong><em>Off Broadway Award for Best Indie Game<br></em></strong><em>Blue Prince</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Herman Melville Award for Best Writing in a Game<br></em></strong><em>Blippo+</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Statue of Liberty Award for Best World<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades II</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a></em></p>

<p><strong><em>A-Train Award for Best Mobile Game<br></em></strong><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></p>



<p><strong><em>High Line Award for Best Remake<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Chumley’s Speakeasy Award for Best Hidden Gem<br></em></strong><em>News Tower</em></p>



<p><strong><em>NYC GWB Award for Best DLC<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P: Overture</a></em></p>



<p>This year's edition of the <strong>Andrew Yoon Legend Award</strong> went to a company rather than a person (last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was the recipient): <strong>The Pokémon Company</strong>.</p>

			<p><strong>Bungie</strong> has so far <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>Marathon</strong> would launch in March, but not exactly when. An <strong>Xbox Store</strong> leak may have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgsa0y/marathon_release_date_discovered_on_xbox_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed it to be <strong>March 5</strong></a>, so at the very beginning of the month.</p>



<p>Later, an Xbox user even <strong>captured the pre-order trailer</strong> and posted it on Streamable. You can find it embedded below - hurry up, though, as parent company <strong>Sony</strong> is likely to issue a DMCA takedown soon. Anyway, there's a <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> that includes the so-called <strong>Midnight Decay bundle</strong> (two weapon skins) and more. No doubt, Bungie will share additional details when pre-orders open. It could be in just a few hours, as companies tend to follow up quickly on leaks to definitively confirm or refute the information.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Marathon returns almost exactly thirty years after the previous franchise entry, Marathon Infinity. This new game is very different from the old ones, though. It's modeled after the growing trend of <strong>PvPvE </strong><span><strong>survival-extraction</strong>&nbsp;<strong>games</strong>, played in first-person</span> only. </p>



<p>In each session, you'll infiltrate the derelict colony of <strong>Tau Ceti IV</strong>, a world whose inhabitants mysteriously vanished and is now contested by rival Runner crews and corporate security forces. Runners are <strong>bio‑cybernetic mercenaries</strong> who use a synthetic body built to survive extreme environments, hunting for weapons, upgrades, and valuable resources across repeated runs. </p>



<p>As with other extraction games, treats come from both NPCs (PvE) and other human players (PvP), <strong>making each session unpredictable</strong>. Additionally, Bungie has included <strong>dynamic events</strong> and <strong>environmental hazards</strong> that should keep players constantly on their toes.</p>



<p><strong>Successful exfiltration advances your character's seasonal power</strong>, earns cosmetics for your achievements, and lets you assemble stronger builds with the stolen loot. In Marathon, players customize their Runner's playstyle using weapons, implants, and equipment they collect.</p>



<p>The most recent official Deep Dive from last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/">showed off the game's <strong>Runner Shells</strong></a>, or classes if you prefer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Destroyer </strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin </strong></li>



<li><strong>Recon </strong></li>



<li><strong>Vandal </strong></li>



<li><strong>Thief </strong></li>



<li><strong>Triage</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There is a seventh Shell, the <strong>Rook</strong>, which can only be used in solo queues and has the advantage of coming with a free standard loadout, allowing newcomers to play without much fear of losing their own items.</p>



<p>The base game will be available at <strong>$39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99</strong>. The Deluxe Edition will certainly be more expensive, although we'll have to wait for the full pre-order announcement to know exactly how much. Marathon will be released on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X </strong>with full <strong>cross-play</strong>.</p>
