			<p>While people are still buying plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/">PS5 consoles</a>, renting a PS5 is becoming an increasingly popular option for players in Japan. A new report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2504/20/news070_4.html">IT Media News</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/renting-ps5s-proving-extremely-popular-in-japan-with-most-stores-selling-out/">VGC</a>) shows that retail stores in Japan where you can rent a PS5 are selling out of consoles to rent.</p>
<p>You can rent a PS5 in multiple regions worldwide, with the cost of renting a PS5 for either 8 days or 15 days at a time in Japan coming in at ¥980 ($6.62 USD) or ¥1,780 ($12.02 USD), respectively. The service only became available in Japan at the top of the year as a response to the console not being as readily available in the region.</p>
<p>A Japanese retailer, GEO, told IT Media news that the service is "<em>more popular than they expected</em>" and that the majority of its 400 stores are "<em>at capacity</em>" with the consoles available to rent. GEO cites the release of Monster Hunter Wilds as a likely reason why the service has, of late, become extremely popular.</p>
<p>Considering the cost, it's a very low barrier to entry if all you want to do is try a console and a new game before making a bigger investment to buy the whole console and a brand-new game. Other retailers around the world, like Raylo in the UK, allow players to rent a PS5 for much longer periods of time. With the popularity of the service in Japan, it wouldn't be surprising if longer rental periods start to be introduced.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that buying a PS5 to own has only gone up in price since it launched in 2020, rather than down, as the case has been in every previous console generation. If you are someone who wants a PS5 but has been unable to buy one for the last five years, it's no surprise that you would jump at the chance to take one home for a couple of weeks for about $12 instead of buying it for hundreds.</p>
<p>At least then you'd be able to satisfy your curiosity to some degree. It'll also be interesting to see if Sony responds by focusing on making more consoles available in Japan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-was-one-of-the-top-10-most-played-games-on-xbox-during-launch-week-in-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> cracked the top 10 list of the most-played games in the US during its launch week, according to Circana's executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>
<p>Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnd7qpxrns27">reported</a> the list of the top 15 games in terms of player engagement for the week of April 12, 2025, which is the week that South of Midnight officially launched. The top 10, even top 15 games regarding player engagement, are usually a very predictable list.</p>
<p>Just think of the most popular live service titles; you'll see most of them on the list. So, for a brand-new single-player game, not based on any existing series, to crack the top 10 is a strong showing.</p>
<p>It didn't crack the top sales list, but with South of Midnight launching into Xbox Game Pass, player engagement was always going to be the more important metric to look at. For Compulsion Games, it's great that so many players were willing to take a chance on South of Midnight and check it out.</p>
<p>The rest of the list includes Marvel Rivals, Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Grand Theft Auto V, EA Sports College Football 25, NBA 2K25 and Rainbow Six Siege. All of them are major live service titles you'll commonly see on lists tracking player engagement.</p>
<p>Of the top 15, the only other single-player game included is Assassin's Creed: Shadows, which came in at number 11, while South of Midnight eked into the top 10 at number 9.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Xbox responds now, because Hi-Fi Rush also launched with strong engagement and positive responses from players and critics. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/">Tango Gameworks</a> was still shuttered by Xbox before being brought back to life by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/">Krafton</a>. Hopefully, Compulsion will continue to get strong support from Xbox instead of suffering the same fate as Tango.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-file-size-massive/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-file-size-massive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered file size is going to be massive, a huge jump over that of the original release and the Definitive Edition, which includes all DLC content.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, X0XLEAK revealed on X that Oblivion Remastered will be 120.94 GB big. While the file size is a huge jump of over 2000% over the original game and the Definitive Edition, it isn't particularly surprising, considering plenty of other games powered by Unreal Engine 5 sport massive file sizes. The leaker also provided proof that this is the correct file size, as it is the size Steam reports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://t.co/aX54ouFIiE">pic.twitter.com/aX54ouFIiE</a></p>
<p>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1914041212744433812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn if Oblivion Remastered will indeed require so much storage space, as one of 2025's worst-kept gaming secrets is apparently releasing<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/"> later today</a>. Even if the game is not launching before the end of the day, its release shouldn't be too far off in the future, as multiple insiders have been suggesting for some time that the highly anticipated remaster of the fourth entry in the series, developed by Bethesda, will make its debut <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">this week</a>. According to other rumors, Oblivion Remastered will also feature all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-all-dlc/">DLC packs</a> released for the original, so the remaster is really setting out to be the best way to experience one of the most beloved role-playing games of all time.</p>
<p>Besides featuring the obvious visual improvements, which have already been showcased in some leaked screenshots <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">last week</a>, Oblivion Remastered will supposedly also feature some<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/"> gameplay enhancements</a>, including an enhanced Stamina system that should make its management less frustrating, and a new blocking system inspired by modern action games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored portable PlayStation 6 will be able to run PlayStation 5 games without developer intervention, although a patch may still be needed for performance.</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-6#post-270341318"> NeoGAF forums</a>, known leaker KeplerL2 revealed today that, as far as they know, the portable system has shader binary compatibility, so it should be able to run previous-generation games without developer intervention. However, performance may not be great if games are left unpatched.</p>
<p>A portable edition of the PlayStation 6 is said to be in the works alongside the standard home variant. While the systems have yet to be officially announced, we already know they will be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">AMD</a>, like their two immediate predecessors, although Intel reportedly bid to produce the system. According to some recent rumors, the portable edition of the next-generation system by Sony will not be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-portable-edition-not-powerful-playstation-5/"> match the current generation base PlayStation 5</a>, but will be<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/"> more powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, and its SoC, which will feature less than 40 CUs, has been designed to run at very low voltages.</p>
<p>The regular edition of the PlayStation 6, on the other hand, hasn't been the subject of too many rumors, but Sony is reportedly planning to make it the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">most powerful system of its console generation</a>, expanding ray tracing and machine learning to offer advanced and innovative gameplay features.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-just-got-its-second-official-trailer.1169250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-just-got-its-second-official-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Softworks and id Software have published the second official DOOM: The Dark Ages trailer at a rather unusual time and date, late on Sunday night (at Easter, no less). Still, it was a nice surprise for fans, to be sure, and the official YouTube channel already shows half a million views in the span of mere hours.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a cinematic trailer, not a gameplay trailer. It's entirely focused on story bits, which reflects what id Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the press</a> when they first discussed the game a couple of months ago: the plot will be more important than ever in a DOOM game. Of course, there's a lot more to DOOM: The Dark Ages, which they described as the most expansive franchise installment yet:</p>
<p><em><strong>Marty Stratton:&nbsp;</strong>It's definitely not an open world game, but it is the most expansive world we've ever built. You really feel like you're on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear DOOM to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>There's a much greater focus on progression items. We've really streamlined the economy and the currencies. I think that's another thing we learned from DOOM Eternal. If you have too many currencies and skill trees, you confuse the player. But speaking of the level design, we're very proud of it. It's some of the best work we've ever done.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 2 (4K) | Available May 15, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1i3YfGl5ag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last month, Wccftech's Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with the game at a press event</a>, and his take was very positive:</p>
<p><em>This massive battlefield was far more open than what you generally get in a DOOM title. Some trappings remained, in that you have arenas to encounter and loads of secrets to find via some exploration, but it never felt constrained by the usual corridors you come to expect. While still somewhat driven, it offered a bit of an open feel, where you could maybe find yourself at odds in one area, decide to tackle somewhere else and rearm before coming back.</em></p>
<p><em>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will launch on May 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation and path tracing</a>. There are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-phil-spencer-teases-more-multiplatform-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors of a Nintendo Switch 2 version</a>, which wouldn't be at all surprising considering that both previous games were released for the original Switch console.</p>
