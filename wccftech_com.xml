			<p><a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/">Enotria: The Last Song</a>, the soulslike developed by Jyamma Games released earlier this year on PC and PlayStation 5, will launch very soon on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Today, it has been confirmed the game will be released on Microsoft's current generation consoles tomorrow, December 12th. Besides being able to explore the sunny game world inspired by Italian landscapes, Xbox players will be able to enjoy the experience complete with all the improvements that have been introduced on PC and PlayStation 5 over the months, such as improved weapon menu interface that now displays average damage of weapons and rarity value, improved fast travel menu and much more.</p>
<p>Enotria: The Last Song was originally supposed to be released on Xbox consoles at the same time as on PC and PlayStation 5, but the game was delayed shortly before launch due to communication issues with Microsoft that prevented the certification process from proceeding as intended. Once the issue had become public, however, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-apologises-to-enotria-the-last-song-developers/">apologized</a> to Jyamma Games and started working closely with them to get the issues sorted out and release the game on Xbox Series X and S as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Enotria: The Last Song is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. The game will launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S tomorrow, December 12th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/possible-new-bend-studio-ip-in-development-after-screenshots-surface/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It appears that there is a new IP being developed by Bend Studio, the developers behind Days Gone and the Syphon Filter franchise. There are already plenty of great games in development from Sony-owned studios, with games like Ghost of Yotei and Marathon being announced to be in development. Despite that, these games don't yet have a release date, and we all know that PlayStation loves to keep its secrets. However, it seems that one of the secrets has accidentally surfaced online and has potentially been revealed before it was supposed to.</p>
<p>This project is a new game from Bend Studio, who created Days Gone in 2019. Although Days Gone was highly successful, with many fans wanting a sequel, it seems that they have chosen to avoid that route and have instead decided to work on a new IP, presumably with Sony's blessing.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-studio-sony-bend-seemingly-working-on-playstation-live-service-game/">Several job listings have surfaced online</a>, suggesting that Bend Studio's new IP will be a live-service title with the makings of the open-world systems that appeared in Days Gone. However, other than the job listings and some screenshots, there hasn't been much information to go on. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/dkxvre/sony_bend_days_gone_studio_already_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer reported in 2019</a> that Studio Bend was already in pre-production for its next game, roughly six months after Days Gone had been released.</p>
<p>Since this information was covered, a new discovery has been made of an online portfolio of a UI designer who worked at Bend Studio from 2022 until March 2024. Their name has been protected, but their portfolio shows that they were working on an unannounced Bend Studio project and had several images in their portfolio that were seemingly concepts from the Bend project.</p>

<p>These images have been <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded to MP1st</a>, which showcases a Military style game, with a futuristic sci-fi feel to it. Admittedly, the images don't reveal much other than some of the UI elements, and weaponry that players would be able to access. There were some images of the overworld, but it wasn't fully developed yet, and didn't really show off anything that could be seen as significant.</p>
<p>As it's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-bend-studio-next-game-multiplayer-open-world-systems/">confirmed by Bend Studio</a> that there are going to be multiplayer elements and an open-world, the theme of a Military style game has potential, especially as it could play relatively similar to Days Gone, just without the zombies.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all speculation at the moment, and it could be that this information isn't relevant at all to the supposed new game in development. While The Game Awards will be taking place this weekend, it's hard to say whether a game like this will make an appearance.</p>

			<p>ASTRO BOT is a game that took the world by storm when it was released, giving plenty of fun nods to the expansive history of PlayStation while you get to play as ASTRO BOT, who first made an appearance in The Playroom, with ASTRO BOT being a sequel to Astro's Playroom. It's now been confirmed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and Team ASOBI that a new free update will be released for ASTRO BOT on December 12 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET, which adds a little bit of content to the game. There will be a brand-new level for players to explore, as well as new special bots for you to rescue, much like you had to in the previous levels.</p>
<p>However, to be able to access this update, you need to have completed the game first. "Since we want it to remain a little surprise, we will not say too much, but you should expect a fun-filled level with shiny presents, a good dose of jingle bells, and brand-new special bots to add to your crew!" says Studio Director Nicolas Doucet.</p>
<p>While the update isn't as big as the previous one they added to the game, it's nice to see that they are still adding content to the game, especially due to how beloved it is. Across multiple award ceremonies, ASTRO BOT has been the receiver of awards and many nominations, with the game already winning five awards. The Game Awards will be taking place on Friday, where they are nominated for a whopping seven awards this year.</p>
<p>When it comes to the audience they had in mind for this update, it's been confirmed by Doucet that there is no sort of trickery and challenges involved, and it's just meant to be a good time had by all.</p>
<p>"This winter update was made with every user in mind, meaning it is a celebration enjoyable for children and adults alike. So, no hair-pulling challenge this time! We had a lot of fun making this special present for you all, and we hope you enjoy it very much, too."</p>
<p>For more details about the update, you can check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a> post, which is where they announced the new content coming to the game.

			<p>A new Donkey Kong Country Returns HD trailer has been released by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-series-developer-monolith-soft-is-now-fully-owned-by-nintendo/">Nintendo</a>, and it showcases some of the content that players can expect from this nostalgic journey. This game was originally released on both the Nintendo Wii and the Nintendo 3DS, with the 3DS having extra levels. In this new visually-enhanced version of the game, those levels will be included, and as a result, there are 80 levels across nine different worlds for players to explore. For those interested in getting this game, it will be available on Nintendo Switch on January 16, 2025. For a glimpse into what's to come, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="A barrelful of details on Donkey Kong Country Returns HD! (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/skNFOPOiyYw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game has lots of fun details for those who are completionists, as there are secrets and collectibles to gather, as well as a Time Attack medal, which will require the player to be quick on their feet, especially when it comes to facing off against the boss battles at the end of each world.</p>
<p>Much like many other Donkey Kong games, players will also be able to play this game in local co-ops, allowing you to play with a friend or family member, where your teammate can play as Diddy Kong and give you a helping hand.&nbsp; By having Diddy Kong help you out, you will be able to utilize his jet pack, which can be used for some of the more challenging jumps in the game, as well as to fight off enemies using his peanut popgun.</p>
<p>When the game was first released for the Nintendo Wii, it was proven to be quite challenging. In this remastered version of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, you will have the option to choose between Classic Mode, which is the difficulty it was at originally, or playing using Modern Mode if you need a bit of a helping hand and want an easier experience.</p>
<p>Of course, it's completely up to you whether you play this game solo or with a friend, and you are still able to succeed just using Donkey Kong's Ground Pound and Barrel Roll.</p>
<p>For those interested, you<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOooFtowm_VZ2XeH0f79at3njXQb3iRlhA9zoLIZEmBbGY991JSvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> can currently pre-order the game</a> now for a price of $59.99, with the game set to release on January 16, 2025.</p>
