			<p>Lords of the Fallen II developer and publisher CI Games has already shared the game's PC system requirements, even though it may well be several months—if not a full year—before it actually launches. The specs have been listed <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Epic Games Store page</a>, although they do not include any target resolution, frame rate, or graphics preset, making them quite vague.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>



<li>CPU: Intel i5 8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>



<li>Memory: 12 GB</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Recommended Requirements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>



<li>CPU: Intel i7 8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li>
</ul>



<p>The store page also lists the languages in which the game will be subtitled: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), and Russian.</p>



<p>Like the previous game, Lords of the Fallen II will run on Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Hopefully, it will perform better than its predecessor did at its launch, taking advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-declares-great-hitch-hunt-rid-games-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UE5's latest improvements to combat stuttering</a>.</p>



<p>Lords of the Fallen II was formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-debut-trailer-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at Gamescom 2025 with a cinematic trailer and the confirmation of the 2026 target release window. The game will take place several centuries after the previous installment, retaining the dual-world mechanics. The world of the dead, Umbral, is said to be encroaching on Axiom, the world of the living, and players will have to find a way to stop it from consuming all existence.</p>



<p>The developers also vowed to take into account the community's feedback for this sequel, implementing several highly requested features and improving the combat balance, as already glimpsed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lords of the Fallen version 2.0</a>. Overall, CI Games hopes for Lords of the Fallen II to pull off <a href="https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an “Empire Strikes Back” moment for the fantasy action RPG franchise</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Blizzard Had Filed A Copyright Infringement Lawsuit Against World of Warcraft Turtle WoW Server]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/blizzard-lawsuit-world-of-warcraft-turtle-wow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-had-filed-a-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-against-world-of-warcraft-turtle-wow-server.1285581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has recently filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-wow-2-0-server-will-bring-azeroth-to-unreal-engine-5-with-dlss-and-fsr-support/">Turtle WoW server</a>, highlighting in the suit how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing infringement of the company's intellectual property.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/08/30/blizzard-files-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-against-world-of-warcraft-rogue-server-turtle-wow/">Massively Overpowered</a>, Blizzard finally took action against the rogue World of Warcraft server with a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71235075/1/blizzard-entertainment-inc-v-turtle-wow/">lawsuit</a> that details how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing intellectual property infringement, profiting from the immense popularity of the popular MMORPG using protected vode and game assets.</p>



<p><em>"In the two decades since WoW first was released, Blizzard has invested an enormous amount of time and money into creating, maintaining, and updating the game,"</em> the legal complaint reads. <em>"But when unscrupulous actors such as Defendants seek to profit from Blizzard’s valuable intellectual property (including protected code and game assets) they undermine Blizzard’s own efforts to deliver classic and community-driven content, devalue the WoW experience, and cause serious harm to Blizzard and the many artists, programmers, game designers, and other creative professionals who have worked (and continue to work) tirelessly to create a unique and enjoyable gaming experience for both new and longtime players."</em></p>



<p>Everything considered, it's unlikely that the operators of the Turtle WoW servers will be able to prevent the complete shutdown of the server, all copies of the data from the project, a full account of the money earned by the project and the relinquishing of the domain to Blizzard as the company is demanding in the lawsuit, leaving players with no other choice but to play World of Warcraft classic to enjoy the vanilla WoW experience, although without the custom content the Turtle WoW server offered. The server operators, however, don't want to go down without a fight and have promised on the server's official Discord that Turtle WoW is here to stay and that they are prepared to take on the challenges ahead of them.</p>



<p>Speaking about the modern World of Warcraft experience, the long-running MMORPG will be expanded next year with the Midnight expansion. You can learn more about it in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">interview</a> conducted during last month's Gamescom.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 seems to handle <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-6-rtxdi/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> surprisingly well, delivering a solid experience in docked mode.</p>



<p>Early docked footage of the open-world game released last year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S surfaced online, providing a good look at how the console handles the game in both its linear and open-world segments. While the footage makes it clear plenty of compromises had to be made to get the game running on the new generation Nintendo console, Star Wars Outlaws seems to keep to its 30 FPS cap, resulting in a decent enough performance in docked mode. No handheld footage was shared, however, so it remains to be seen if the system will be able to deliver a decent experience on the go.</p>

<p>In its launch window, the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to receive plenty of third-party ports, and some of them, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077 port</a>, have shown the level of image quality and performance the system can achieve with proper optimization. In the coming months, the next-generation system by Nintendo will receive a few other ports, and some of them are seemingly set to be at the opposite ends of the spectrum, in terms of quality. The Final Fantasy VII Remake Nintendo Switch 2 port will likely be among the best ports, achieving a higher level of quality than the original PlayStation 4 version, which is definitely impressive for a handheld system. On the other hand, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition already doesn't seem to be faring well, possibly due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">CPU limitations</a> and the fact that the game's engine will effectively be its first port for the ARM platform.</p>



<p>Though port quality may differ, the Nintendo Switch 2 offers a lot of improvements over its predecessor. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>
