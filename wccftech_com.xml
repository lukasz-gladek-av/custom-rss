			<p>A DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5 fan-made remake is in development, and it's looking great with some advanced visual features in a new video shared online this week.</p>
<p>The fan-made remake of the third main entry in the series by id Software is being worked on by François Montagud, who shared a look at the latest version of the remake in a new video. The new version of the remake, which is sadly not available for download publicly, features reworked visual and gameplay aspects to enhance the game's atmosphere and tension. These reworked features include improved dynamic lighting and FX, more reactive AI behaviors, updated shooting system with better visual feedback, reworked sound effects, and more. While far from perfect, it's undeniable how this tech demo gets a lot of things right, and some of its elements are downright impressive, such as the smoke behavior with the dead enemy at the 2:20 mark.</p>
<p><iframe title="[UE5] DOOM 3 Fan Remake" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LZNjRkCNs0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5. remake cannot be played right now, fans of the id Software series will soon be able to enjoy a new entry in the series with DOOM: The Dark Ages, which is launching next week on PC and consoles. The next entry in the series promises to be another excellent action-packed first-person shooter, as highlighted by Chris in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/"> hands-on preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.</em></p>

			<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an update on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo lawsuit</a>, or rather, not on the lawsuit itself, which is still ongoing, but on its impacts on the game. The developer has had to introduce some changes due to the lawsuit, as detailed below:</p>
<p><em>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</em></p>
<p><em>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</em><br>
<em>We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo is invoking patent infringement, but Pocketpair alleges that at least some of those patents were filed after the release of their game. We'll keep you updated with any major updates to the lawsuit involving one of the biggest games of 2024.</p>

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is less than two months from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned release date</a>. As part of a media blast, creator Hideo Kojima was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/death-stranding-2-an-interview-with-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed by the PlayStation Blog</a>, revealing more details about the sequel. For instance, the upcoming game will provide players with more choice and freedom in comparison to the previous installment.</p>
<p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was designed with a similar philosophy. Players familiarized themselves with the ‘delivery game’ genre with the first game, and the sequel builds on that and provides players with more choice and freedom, particularly around combat; you can go in guns blazing, or you can choose not to use weapons at all. We also made cars and motorcycles more accessible.</em></p>
<p><em>As for the story, the predecessor was centred around Sam and Cliff. This time, the story delves deeper into who Lou is, her relationship with Sam, as well as Sam’s backstory.</em></p>
<p>Kojima then talked about the choice of setting (Mexico and Australia):</p>
<p><em>Mexico shares a border with the UCA (United Cities of America), so the neighboring cities had to be connected. As Sam mentions many times in the game, we were extremely mindful that building these ‘connections’ didn’t appear invasive. Sam’s journey of connecting the Americas from east to west was inspired by the American frontier. With the UCA established, we wanted the sequel to take place in a location that shared a similar geography with the Americas — stretches from east to west and borders the sea in the north and south. Eurasia is too large, and Africa didn’t really fit the bill either. Australia checked all the boxes, but the next issue we faced was how to connect the North American continent with Australia. After a lot of discussion, we decided to implement the ‘plate gate’ to connect the two continents.</em></p>

<p>Today, Sony also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/revealing-the-dualsense-wireless-controller-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-limited-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Limited Edition DualSense controller. The design was conceived in collaboration with the game developer, Kojima Productions.</p>
<p>The controller will be available on June 26, the same day as the game. Its price is $84.99 / €84.99 / £74.99 / ¥12,480. Pre-orders will begin on May 22 at 10 AM local time via the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Direct website</a> in the following countries: United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/empyreal-review-a-forgettable-space-adventure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p>Ever since FromSoftware's Souls series started rising in popularity, the vast majority of action role-playing games developed by smaller and more established studios have been inspired in some capacity by the Japanese developer's franchise. While many of these games are great experiences on their own, they highlighted how the genre is suffering from some homogenization, where very few are the games that try to break from the mould and offer something different. For this reason, I could not help but appreciate Empyreal's approach to the genre <a href="https://wccftech.com/empyreal-hands-on-preview-an-arpg-of-a-different-kind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when I first tried it in February</a>.</p>
<p>While the game doesn't leave a great impression going from the visuals alone, some of its gameplay mechanics felt unique enough to give the game a very peculiar identity. Even then, however, I felt that there could have been some issues, but I expected elements to come together better once I could experience the game from the very beginning and go through the onboarding process. Unfortunately, experiencing Empyreal from the beginning only made it more evident how these issues result in a game more frustrating to play than fun.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502164603_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Empyreal is set on an unnamed, unexplored planet where a colossal structure known as the Monolith has been discovered. As the first Expedition that set foot on the planet quickly realized, this Monolith isn't just something left behind by a lost civilization, but a mysterious place that is still very much alive, filled with powerful automatons and all sorts of dangers that feel geared towards preventing anyone from reaching its deepest recesses. With the Expedition on the brink of complete failure, a gifted mercenary reaches the planet to do what it failed to accomplish, and discover what truly lies inside the Monolith that no man should have ever awakened.</p>
<p>From the premise, it's clear that Empyreal's story is somewhat uninspired. It's not particularly bad, to be honest, but it really doesn't feature anything that makes it remarkable. The characters don't fare much better, as they have a paperthin predictable characterization, going from the grumpy Expedition leader with a bone to pick with anyone that isn't a member of the Expedition itself, the helpful but a little airheaded scientist, the welcoming and mostly helpful quartermaster, the wacky merchant and scrapper-meets-blacksmith and so on.</p>
<p>None of them is particularly annoying, to be honest, but they fail to make an impression so much with their limited development and generic design that it is easy even to forget their names. Overall, the story and characters in Empyreal are nothing more than a backdrop to justify the exploration of the Monolith and a way to access some critical services needed to complete the game.</p>
<p>With the story not being particularly involving, nor the characters much endearing, it's clear how developer Silent Games placed greater emphasis on gameplay in Empyreal. During your first trek into the Monolith after creating your character via a character creator featuring a decent selection of options, you will experience a good portion of what Empyreal has to offer: intricate locations with plenty of side paths to explore filled with additional items that can be sold for silver and gear of different rarity and levels, powerful Automaton enemies with varied movesets and configurations that require players to strategize on the fly to deal with the most annoying enemies first before handling everyone else using one of the three weapon types - Glaive, Mace &amp; Shield and the Cannon - and abilities with cooldown mechanics that can be unleashed at will without having to worry about spending resources like AP or MP, and some items coming with both supporting and offensive support.</p>
<p>The game generally does a decent job introducing its central mechanics throughout the first few journeys to the Monolith, and though there's a general clunkiness to movement and attacking, it's easy to see the potential, especially with some of the unique defensive mechanics the game features which combine a relatively straightforward parry and perfect dodge mechanic, depending on the weapon, with a charging bar beneath each enemies' names that indicates when their next attack will go off, almost giving some turn-based feel to the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502174257_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After gathering a few Cartograms, blueprints which determine every aspect of every trek into the Monolith, including level, biome, elemental affinity of enemies, loot table, and bosses, and going through stages a couple of times, however, what was only a thought in the back of the mind becomes reality. Empyreal is a game that's more frustrating to play than fun, due to the average execution of its mechanics. The clunky movement and stiff animations are only two of the reasons the game becomes frustrating fast.</p>
<p>For starters, there is no lock-on, an interesting choice for a game that wants players to go after specific enemies first due to their supporting capabilities that only makes matters more frustrating, as not only the camera needs constant readjusting to have a good view of the battlefield, but enemies also attack from off-screen without any indicator, with a few exceptions, which makes it very difficult to avoid their attacks. In addition, a good portion of these attacks teleport the Automatons to the player or have insane tracking, so unless your parries and dodges are on point, you will eat a lot of damage quickly. The fact that enemies are not staggered by regular attacks and a good number of abilities unless the bar below their health bar has been filled, leaving them staggered and open to a powerful critical attack, often resulting in your character being defenseless after unleashing them.</p>
<p>All of the above often forces players to use hit and run tactics with the two close-range weapons, or in a constant parry and counterattack playstyle that gets very old fast. In addition, even the parry and dodging mechanics feel clunky, as both are mapped to the same button, which is not ideal. As if all this wasn't enough, there are times when some maneuvers go off for no apparent reason. A few times, I had a ranged counterattack with the Glaive going off for no reason during a boss battle, which essentially teleported me towards an untimely death. Ultimately, things get a little better by using items, but too often I felt I was fighting against the mechanics, rather than against the enemies. Even boss battles are not exempt from this. The contrary. Their tendency to constantly call in minions only adds to the frustration, and what could have been challenging duels become a constant hit-and-run fight that's not very fun.</p>
<p>It's a shame the central combat mechanics are not executed too well, as Empyreal does a few things right that would have made fans of classic ARPGs like the Diablo series quite happy. The gear customization system, for example, is well-developed, allowing players almost from the beginning of the adventure to customize their equipment using specific materials that can enhance attributes at the expense of others, randomly roll properties, and more. With an emphasis on elemental properties, Empyreal also offers different slots in which to save loadouts for quick switching, which ultimately incentivizes going into stages with very different elemental properties.</p>
<p>The three weapon types are also quite diverse from one another, and even offer different playstyles in combination with a good selection of abilities obtained by using silver and sometimes items at the blacksmith, which range from purely offensive skills to support skills that also have unique effects by just equipping them. Level design is also varied enough, although things get a little repetitive within a specific biome, which is to be expected, but still, with so many materials to collect, the game does a solid job providing players with a reason to go off the beaten path and to shoot for things other than the final boss of each Cartogram. Even in terms of endgame content, Empyreal gets things right, offering a New Game + mode with an increased level cap for Cartograms, new NPC duels, and an epilogue with a new ending.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502172501_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even if one were to look past some of the issues above and enjoy the best features Empyreal offers, it won't take too long for the gameplay loop to become tiring. Proper multiplayer features may have provided some more incentives to grind, but in this regard, Empyreal doesn't offer much besides some asymmetrical mechanics that allow players to receive gear from other players as a gift, a free immediate respawn during boss battles, and a simple sharing and trading system for items and Cartograms. In conjunction with the frustrating combat, this makes it almost pointless to delve deeper into anything that isn't strictly story-related.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Empyreal doesn't exactly strike a good impression as the Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals are not very good. While some of the biomes inside the Monolith have a distinct look, most of the game's locations aren't particularly good-looking. The worst offender is definitely the main camp, which looks terribly generic and almost lifeless with its flat lighting. The character and enemy models don't fare much better, as they are just as uninspired and dull as the main camp.</p>
<p>Empyreal also leaves something to be desired in terms of performance on PC. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran considerably worse than I expected, given the undemanding visuals it pushes, struggling to run past the 90 FPS average range at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode, no Frame Generation and high settings. A benchmark session held in an area generated in the Monolith's first biome, Man &amp; Church, using a mid-game Cartogram ran at an average of 93 FPS and 16 FPS 1% low, which is way below what a system with those specifications should have delivered in an undemanding game.</p>
<p>I did not experience any major stuttering, to be honest, so the experience was playable, but systems with lower specifications than mine may have some trouble running the game properly, even with the supported upscalers, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and UE5's TSR, and frame generation tech, DLSS and FSR.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Empyreal took only around 18 hours to complete, but many of these hours were not particularly enjoyable. While the game has a few things that work well, they are not enough to salvage an experience that could have been something more than the frustrating one that ended up being. With some tweaks to combat and maybe proper multiplayer, the experience crafted by Silent Games has the potential to become something else, so I sincerely hope the studio will have the opportunity to do so, as some of the ideas implemented in the game are definitely solid.</p>

				<p>Empyreal's ambition to do something different is commendable, but it's ultimately the only thing it truly has going for it. While character customization and the Cartogram system are solid enough, the forgettable and generic story and characters, average and clunky combat and the lack of proper multiplayer mechanics make the game a frustrating experience that gets tiring very quickly and one that only the most diehard ARPG fans might briefly appreciate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-2-breaks-all-time-24h-viewership-records-beating-deadpool-vs-wolverine/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If anyone thought the recent confirmation of a GTA VI delay (the game's launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been moved</a> from Fall 2025 to May 26, 2026) would harm its hype, the first viewership registered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second trailer</a> will make them reconsider.</p>
<p>According to Rockstar Games (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-views-record-1236210396/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Hollywood Reporter</a>), the trailer that suddenly aired two days ago surpassed 475 million views across all platforms in the first twenty-four hours. This makes it the most-viewed trailer of all time, not just among games but across all entertainment, beating the previous record of Deadpool vs. Wolverine, which stopped at 365 million views. The recent trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps registered around 200 million views in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>For comparison, the first GTA VI trailer only garnered 93 million views. However, it was a YouTube exclusive, and it still managed to become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most-viewed non-music video of all-time on the platform</a>, second only to a couple of songs from the South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
<p>That trailer also helped bring its featured song (Love Is a Long Road, made by Tom Petty) to the top of the music charts, and the same is true this time around with the new trailer's song, Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters. According to Spotify, the song's popularity grew by 182,000% (not a typo) following the debut of the GTA VI trailer.</p>
<p>Sulinna Ong, Spotify’s global head of editorial, stated:</p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto cuts through popular culture like almost nothing else. Music has been synonymous with the series since the very beginning, so it’s great to see fans both new and established connecting with an iconic track in this way.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday, Rockstar Games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the trailer was captured on Sony's PlayStation 5 hardware with a mix of gameplay and cutscenes. Given how great it looked, that's highly reassuring. PlayStation 5 Pro users may get even better visuals or higher frame rate options.</p>
<p>As for PC, Rockstar hasn't said anything about the platform's launch window yet, but a prominent manufacturer of PC gaming peripherals <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> GTA VI should be released only a few months after the console debut.</p>
