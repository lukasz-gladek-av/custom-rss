			<p>Independent developer Moon Studios (known for the Ori franchise) unveiled the launch date of <strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong>, the long-awaited online co-op update for the action RPG currently in early access, during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIqY6Sszcw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Wicked Inside' livestream</a>. The patch will go live on <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, but you can test it right now thanks to a limited time Open Beta test that runs through Monday, December 22. </p>



<p>The developers have introduced the co-op implementation as a response to the structural limitations inherent in contemporary action RPG multiplayer modes. According to Moon Studios founder and CEO Thomas Mahler, each of the current modes, like host-guest, adding random players, or summoning them FromSoftware-style, fails because they lack "the feeling that we think most players always desire to have when playing an RPG together with others."</p>



<p>The design the studio settled on is, instead, a combination of the systemic depth and meaningful personal interaction of traditional ARPGs with the persistent, shared-world architecture of MMORPGs, while avoiding the subscription requirements and always-online dependencies of the latter. The ambitious goal is to evoke "the magical feeling of playing your very first D&amp;D campaign".</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, No Rest for the Wicked Together operates through <strong>persistent shared realms</strong>. When a player first creates a realm and invites friends, that realm becomes permanently accessible, independent of any host's connection status. This is akin to Minecraft's realm model. Up to four players can simultaneously inhabit a specific realm. With this structure, one player may undertake quests solo while companions are offline, and their actions remain visible upon their friends' eventual return. <strong>Community chests</strong> serve as asynchronous trading mechanisms, which is particularly valuable when fellow players have different playing schedules. </p>



<p>Moreover, rather than individuals owning separate residences, the party collectively purchases a shared home and establishes granular permissions: full access for some chests, private storage for others, shared crafting tables and refineries available to all members. Moon Studios also confirmed that the Crucible, the roguelike area that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-update-revamps-crucible-improves-combat-and-adds-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally revamped shortly after the early access debut</a>, supports full cooperative play. When it comes to combat, the developers warned that enemies and bosses in multiplayer get new AI behaviours, so they may require tactical adjustments to be defeated.</p>



<p>While No Rest for the Wicked Together is clearly focused on co-op multiplayer functionality, the patch will also introduce various improvements that will be equally interesting to those who prefer to play solo. For example, higher-tier items now guarantee superior enchantment rolls with increased slot quantities; weapons now possess random critical strike chances; all enemies now support backstab mechanics; the bows' projectile behavior now fundamentally changes based on the equipped quiver type; the hardest difficulty tier introduces higher enemy density, based on community feedback.</p>

<p>No Rest for the Wicked launched in <strong>April 2024</strong> on early access and immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed a lot of potential</a>.  However, it didn't quite achieve the same level of success the studio had hoped for. Even though SteamDB suggests sales are between a million and a million and a half units, Moon Studios founder and CEO Thomas Mahler issued a desperate plea to its community, asking for help to improve the Steam user review score, although he later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> that the studio was not actually in immediate danger of closing down.</p>



<p>The game still doesn't have a launch window for version 1.0. When the full game launches, Moon Studios plans to release it on consoles as well, although they <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-might-initially-skip-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while back</a> that Xbox might be skipped due to 'market conditions' (the platform's declining sales). No Rest for the Wicked is currently 30% off as part of the Steam Winter Sale, by the way.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> points to Naughty Dog already enforcing mandatory overtime to finish a demo for <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet,</a> its upcoming project and the first new franchise from the studio in over a decade. The game won't be out for a while - <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/">it likely won't be out next year</a> - but the crunching has already started.</p>



<p>Firstly, don't get excited about the demo. It's not for players, or at least that's not what the report claims it is for. According to the employees Schreier spoke to, who remained anonymous as they were not permitted to speak publicly about this, the demo was for a milestone check-in with Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>



<p>The mandatory overtime reportedly started in late October and has been going on since, working an extra eight hours a week, though they were asked not to work more than 60 hours per week. On top of having to put more time in, employees were also reportedly called back into the office for this period for a full five days a week instead of three.</p>



<p>As Schreier previously reported, the game is still set to arrive sometime mid-2027, but if the studio is already crunching on milestones like this, employees are concerned about what that says for the rest of the game's development as they inch closer to the launch of Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-naughty-dog-devs-crunch/">We know that crunch culture has been an issue</a> for Naughty Dog in the past, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/striking-distance-callisto-protocol-crunch/">that crunch culture has been a problem</a> across triple-A development for several studios. But, as Schreier points out, the backlash from players towards studios and their leadership that makes these decisions (which, for Naughty Dog, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/">Neil Druckmann</a>) has led to studios changing. Or, at least it led to them saying they would change.</p>



<p>As for how the studio will move forward right now, the report adds that the overtime mandate ended for the majority of the studio this week, with its previous schedule returning for January. A new schedule for what comes after January 2026 will be released when the studio returns from its holiday break.</p>



<p>There's <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-is-at-the-stage-of-polishing-devs-confirm-2-endings-and-stable-performance-on-ps4/">always a polishing stage</a> towards the end of a game's development. That's normal, and it's possible to go through that polishing stage without overworking the team. For Naughty Dog to reportedly already start putting its developers through periods of mandated overtime this far out from release does not inspire confidence that Druckmann and the studio's leadership will refrain from doing so again, and perhaps for a longer period of time.</p>
