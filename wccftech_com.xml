			<p>This week, NVIDIA has added twelve games to its GeForce NOW cloud platform. This includes an exclusive first look demo at Sunderfolk, a rather unique game developed by Secret Door and published by Dreamhaven. In Sunderfolk, up to four players share the magical and dangerous world of Sunderland in a turn-based tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. The game was designed with a couch co-op experience in mind. Each player chooses one of six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue). Together, players venture into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat. During combat, there is no set order of player turns, so your strategy can change on the fly to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to work together to find the best path to success.</p>
<p>In the First Look Demo (which is available on GeForce NOW through April 7), players will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 4 missions from Act 1</li>
<li>All 6 playable characters</li>
<li>Experience core aspects of the game (MIssions, Relationship Building, Town Building</li>
<li>Upgrades, Crafting)</li>
<li>Unlimited playthroughs</li>
<li>Estimated 2-3 hours of gameplay per campaign</li>
<li>Local and remote co-op play</li>
</ul>
<p>GeForce NOW users can also play the newly released games <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, both of which were recently reviewed on Wccftech. The other highlight is undoubtedly inZOI, which features the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and ray tracing, both available to GFN Ultimate tier subscribers. The game also marks the debut of the NVIDIA ACE technology through the so-called Smart ZOI NPCs, powered by a 0.5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model that runs exclusively on GeForce RTX hardware. inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launches tomorrow in early access</a>. Lastly, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a> is also available via GeForce NOW.</p>
