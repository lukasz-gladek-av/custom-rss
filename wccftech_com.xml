<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-adds-balatro-ark-survival-ascended-and-warhammer-40k-boltgun-for-may-2025/">PS Plus Essential</a> games for May 2025 added Balatro, Warhammer 40K: Boltgun, and ARK: Survival Ascended to the game libraries of PlayStation Plus subscribers, and combined with these 10 games, it makes for a solid month of PlayStation Plus offerings.</p>
<p>Players jumping into the STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will also be glad to know they'll be playing the newly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-adds-balatro-ark-survival-ascended-and-warhammer-40k-boltgun-for-may-2025/">Enhanced Editions</a> of the remasters, which all come with new graphical features for players on PS5 and other current-gen consoles.</p>
<p>Strong offering or not though, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">recent price hikes to PlayStation Plus services</a> in regions across the world (though outside of the US for now), each new batch of monthly games is another monthly reminder for players to consider whether what they spend on PlayStation Plus is actually worth it, especially for those subscribed to the higher tiers.</p>
