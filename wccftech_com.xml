			<p>During the TGA 2024 pre-show, French developer Tactical Adventures announced Solasta II, sequel to the solid 2021 cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-tactics-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solasta: Crown of the Magister</a>. Like its predecessor, it is based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons SRD 5.1 ruleset, although set in its own world.</p>
<p>The sequel takes place decades after the events witnessed in Crown of the Magister and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/palace-of-ice-dlc-for-solasta-crown-of-the-magister-launches-on-may-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palace of Ice DLC</a>. This time, a new band of adventurers will set out on the continent of Neokos, which has been conquered by a powerful, corrupting villain called Shadwyn. Her character will be voiced by Amelia Tyler, the award-winning actress behind Baldur's Gate III's narrator and Hades II's Hecate.</p>
<p>This is an inkling of the 'level up' that Tactical Adventures is planning for Solasta II, which will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 to deliver much more advanced visuals than the first entry, as you can see in the debut trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solasta II - Official Announcement Trailer [TGA 2024]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ruN-X04RxFA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the gameplay front, Solasta II will once again allow players to take control of a group of four characters, which will be fully voiced this time, not to mention customizable when it comes to skills and abilities. The online co-op mode feature will be added during the Early Access phase.</p>
<p>Throughout the story campaign, players must navigate the various factions, get to know the inhabitants of Neokos, and most importantly, make wise decisions. Their choices will determine whether they are favored or despised.</p>
<p>Mathieu Girard, the game's Creative Director, said:</p>
<p><em>Our team of 35 combines deep expertise with a passion for crafting immersive and challenging gaming experiences. With our first game, we started as a Kickstarter success story, building on the SRD 5.1 ruleset to create a tactical RPG that has resonated with over 1.5 million players. Now, with Solasta II, we’re taking all that even further – pushing the system with fresh takes on tactical depth, fun and accessibility. Players will explore Neokos, a new continent brimming with magic, colossal landscapes and discover unprecedented lore, while facing the growing force of Shadwyn, a charismatic villain driven by a relentless desire to reclaim her lost power. This project is powered by ambition, respect for our players and a shared belief in the strength of what we’re building together. We can’t wait for everyone to get their hands on it and tell us what they think!</em></p>
<p>Solasta II will launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> sometime next year, although a free demo will be shared in early 2025, providing fans with a juicy taste of what's to come. Later today, Tactical Adventures will host a developer live stream <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticaladventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a>. It will go live at 9 AM PST / 12 PM EST / 6 PM CET, if you'd like to follow it.</p>
