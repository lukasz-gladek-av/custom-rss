			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has released its latest report on the top 10 games for June 2025 by both monthly active users (MAU) and revenue. In its report for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">May 2025</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign was the top story, but this time around, it's Dune all June, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-patch-notes-deep-desert-changes/">Dune: Awakening</a> breaks into the top-5 games by revenue, and Sloclap's arcade football game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a> is able to eek into the top-10.</p>



<p>Nightreign hasn't entirely fallen off the map, to be fair, it's just a few places behind where it sat in May, as Dune: Awakening took Nightreign's place as the number five game in the list of top 10 games by revenue. Rematch, for its part, made it to number nine, while everything else in the top 10 rankings mostly stayed the same, save for Valorant jumping up six places to make it into the top 10 at number seven.</p>



<p>Zooming out a bit more into the top-20, other notable entries are Toby Fox's Deltarune, which snuck in at number 20, and the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which arrived at the tail-end of June and made it into the top-20 games by revenue in 15th place. </p>



<p>Dead By Daylight was another notable entry in the top-20 games by revenue, in part because it was one of the few games to hold a top-20 spot in both revenue and MAUs for June 2025. It jumped 17 places from May to make it into the top-20 games by revenue for June, and 13 places to do the same in MAUs, both driven by a new collaboration with Five Nights at Freddy's.</p>



<p>The MAU list for June 2025 was less malleable than the revenue list, as very little changed regarding the top 10. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, Rematch, and Splitgate 2 were the only games not in the top-20 for MAUs in May 2025 that were able to jump into the top-20 for June.</p>



<p>Here's Newzoo's full report and overview for June 2025 for the top games on PC and consoles: </p>
