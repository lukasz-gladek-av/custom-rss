			<p>The PC version of Stellar Blade has finally launched, around thirteen months after the game's or<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iginal debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 console</a>. This version is also published by Sony and as such, it's interesting to compare its early player figures against other recent Sony-published games that made it to the PC platform.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3489700/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade has already more than doubled any previous single player games published by Sony on Valve's store when it comes to concurrent user peak. The action title peaked at 183.8K players around nineteen hours ago, with the potential to go even higher as we head into the weekend, when gamers have more time to play.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/PlayStation+Publishing+LLC/?sort=peak_desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> the previous record earlier this year with 77.1K, although it should be clarified that the game also includes a multiplayer coop mode, Legends. As such, it might be more appropriate to consider Sony Santa Monica's God of War, which peaked at 73.5K players, the previous record holder. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered reached a peak of 66.4K players; Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition stopped at 56.5K, while its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, peaked at 40.4K players. The Last of Us Part I registered 36.4K concurrent players on Steam, narrowly beating God of War Ragnarok (35.6K), The Last of Us Part II Remastered (30.6K), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (28.1K), and Days Gone (27.4K). All the others are much lower in the chart. Interestingly, all the first installments registered higher peaks than their sequels.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade is certainly an acclaimed title, having sold enough to warrant a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>. That said, some of the other games mentioned above have rated even higher, despite reaching lower concurrent players on Steam. This new record might be surpassed soon, though, as the next Sony-published PC game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, will release on the same day as on consoles (August 29). It will be the first single-player game published by Sony to launch day and date on PC, and that might be enough to raise interest in the game, provided that it reviews well enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft centric website Windows Central <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the company had paused its work on the Xbox handheld project. This did not affect the partnership with ASUS to make the ROG X Ally and ROG X Ally X, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 for a holiday release window.</p>
<p>Originally, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to use this partnership as a stopgap while it produced its own Xbox handheld that would have been released alongside the next-generation Xbox home console. These plans, however, are more than just paused - they might be practically dead now, according to The Verge's Tom Warren. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>, Warren says that Microsoft will focus on the software platform instead. Furthermore, he points out that while there will be an 'official' next-generation hardware from Microsoft, OEM partners like ASUS may also release their own versions of a next-gen Xbox console.</p>
<p>In that regard, Warren believes that the ASUS-made handhelds are a sort of 'market test' for Microsoft's increasingly tight integration of Windows and Xbox, not to mention the ambitious goal of turning every screen into an Xbox. The Verge's journalist adds that, at some point, the emulation project established by Sarah Bond in early 2024 may solve the issue. Until then, Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming are doing most of the work in helping spread the brand across devices.</p>
<p>Last year, Microsoft has made some lofty promises when it comes to the next-generation console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming</a> that the successor of the Xbox Series X would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever seen' from one generation to another. That's certainly an ambitious goal that could possibly only be achieved through the implementation of machine learning algorithms, although we'll have to wait until Microsoft reveals its hand before assessing the veracity of that statement. The next Xbox is currently thought to be targeting a 2027 launch, presumably near the holiday season.</p>

			<p>After the news that Street Fighter 6 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 5 million units sold, CAPCOM has another sales milestone to announce this week, this time for Devil May Cry 5. The latest installment in the popular action game franchise has <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million units since its debut on March 8, 2019, for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry 5 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-2019-devil-may-cry-5-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 2 million units in less than a month, but then sales slowed down considerably. It wasn't until April 2022 that CAPCOM could <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-over-5-million-units-globally-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the five million sales milestone. Notably, sales were at 9.1 million units as of March 31, 2025, meaning the game sold almost a million units in less than three months.</p>
<p>That's a lot for a relatively old game, but it's not impossible. For one thing, there was the acclaimed Netflix Devil May Cry show that certainly helped push game sales, too. CAPCOM says that with more than 5.3 million views, it ranked fourth globally in the 'Shows | English' category during its first week. It also ranked in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan. Moreover, there was a <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910766029376262605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise sale in April</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM is counting Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition separately. On its Platinum Titles chart, that version is listed as having sold 1 million units on its own, which means that DMC 5 as a whole has technically surpassed 11 million units.</p>
<p>DMC 5 earned high praise here on Wccftech from resident fan Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> the game 9.8 out of 10:</p>
<p>Devil May Cry V is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series so far, taking everything that made Devil May Cry 3 and 4 good and bringing everything up a notch. Those who only wish to play the game through once at regular difficulty will "only" see Devil May Cry V as a very good action game that can keep them engaged from beginning to end, but veterans of the series will see it as the deep, fun and engaging game they have been waiting for over ten years.</p>
