			<p>Newegg, a reputable online retailer for electronics, gaming peripherals, and even games themselves, has <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed the description</a> of their Nintendo eShop Gift Card. In the description, it now mentions games that haven't been announced yet, such as a "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster." At the moment, this information is still on their website and has caused quite a stir.</p>
<p>It is most likely just speculation on Newegg's side, as there have been hints at a new Mario Kart already, thanks to the Nintendo Switch 2 first look trailer, with a lot of the information surrounding it being analyzed by Nintendo fans. There are also titles mentioned, such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-2025-original-switch/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was first announced at E3 in 2017 and has now been confirmed by Nintendo to be released in 2025, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMAgmdR8jwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated trailer</a> released <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">seven months ago</a>. Pokemon Legends: Z-A is also set to release this year. It's uncertain whether these titles will be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 or whether they'll also be released on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As we said above, it is most likely that this description from Newegg is just speculation based on Nintendo's release patterns, as well as what the fans are hoping for. Nintendo fans have been wanting specific Zelda remakes for a long time, with a lot of the audience begging for a remake or remaster of Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Many other Zelda games could also be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2, such as A Link to the Past or Phantom Hourglass. However, those seem less likely.</p>
<p>It's pretty much a given that Nintendo will come up with a new Mario game to release for the Nintendo Switch 2, as Mario is Nintendo's mascot, and they always find ways to create new games surrounding Mario and his troupe. Whether that comes in the form of a new Mario Kart game, a Mario Party game, or even a Mario Sports game, there are plenty of options laid on the table for Nintendo.</p>
<p>With such a description hinting at the release of Nintendo's games that haven't even been announced yet, there is a likelihood that they will be contacted and asked to amend the description in the event that they are on the right track. Nintendo is very protective of their IPs, and has no issue in sending a cease and desist to someone or a company, regardless of how small they are.</p>
