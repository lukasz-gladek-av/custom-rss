			<p>Enshrouded, the popular survival game currently available on PC in early access, has just received its biggest update yet ahead of its 1.0 release due to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026. It's latest Wake of the Water update is available now, and adds highly requested features like voxel-based, dynamic water, a new biome, balance tweaks to combat, and more.</p>



<p>Developer and publisher Keen Games debuted two new trailers alongside today's update, one that's more of a cinematic showcase for the new Wake of the Water update, and another that goes into more detail about what's coming in this new update.</p>

<p>Some of the key features Wake of the Water adds is a whole new water biome with full underwater exploration and dynamic voxel water, which has been one of the most-requested features from players that Keen Games is finally making good on.</p>



<p>The new update also adds new bosses and enemies for players to face, an overhaul to combat with balance tweaks, the introduction of greatswords, new weapon skills, and armor sets. The new update also adds fishing as an activity for players to catch food and adds a new layer to the survival mechanics in Enshrouded, and several more quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>Wake of the Water is Enshrouded's seventh major update during the game's early access period and is the latest showcase for just how much the game has changed and evolved since its initial early access launch in January 2024.</p>



<p>In its initial four days in early access, Enshrouded <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-reaches-over-a-million-players-after-four-days-on-steam-early-access/">was able to reach one million players</a>.  It reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/">three million players by August 2024</a>, and in April 2025, i<a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/">t celebrated over four million players</a>. The growth Enshrouded has had since its launch is incredibly impressive, and it'll be interesting to see if it can continue the momentum it has seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/">early access through to its 1.0 launch next year</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite <span>being largely an interview about Fallout 4 (the </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Anniversary Editio</span>n</a>, which celebrates the game's tenth birthday, launches today), the article published today&nbsp;on GQ,&nbsp;featuring a conversation with Todd Howard, actually begins with The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>



<p>The game designer obviously knew that questions about the most anticipated game in Bethesda's pipeline would abound and prefaces the whole interview with the notion that the next iteration in The Elder Scrolls franchise is 'still a long way off', before adding that he's preaching patience to fans. Howard then admits that it's been too long since Skyrim, which launched in November 2011, but adds that the team as a whole needed a 'creative reset', which they tried to accomplish with Starfield and its different setting.</p>



<p>Later in the interview, after talking a bit about Fallout and the upcoming second season of the Amazon Prime Video TV series, Howard returns to TES VI. Apparently, there was a large playtest session just yesterday at Bethesda Game Studios:</p>



<p><em>We did a big play test yesterday for The Elder Scrolls VI, and you have to really look at the screen and say, “What is this? What does this need? Where are we at?” Great games are played, not made. The screen doesn’t lie.</em></p>



<p>Apparently, the team showed The Elder Scrolls VI to some fans who pulled funds via Make-A-Wish to commemorate a friend of theirs in the upcoming game. It's not the first time Bethesda has done something like this: they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/uesp-wiki-met-bethesda-design-character-the-elder-scrolls-vi-excited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed the game to some folks from the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a>, who left excited about the upcoming title.</p>



<p>In the GQ interview, Howard then says his perfect way to release the massively anticipated roleplaying game would be that, after 'a while', the game 'just appears'. He doesn't guarantee it will go this way, but when asked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-drop of Oblivion Remastered</a>, the developer remarks:</p>



<p><em>You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.</em></p>



<p>Honestly, though, I doubt that will be the case. Microsoft will likely want to give the game, which was formally announced at E3 2018 alongside Starfield, at least some lead time. More likely is a scenario akin to Fallout 4, where Howard unveiled the game at E3 2015 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released it</a> five months later on November 10, 2015. That would still be a relatively short lead time for a triple-A game of this hype.</p>



<p>Our best estimate at this point puts the game in a tentative late 2027 launch window at the earliest, although the first half of 2028 is even more likely. It wouldn't be the first time for an Elder Scrolls launch, either, as Oblivion was released in March 2006. Meanwhile, we'll report on any noteworthy The Elder Scrolls VI rumors.</p>
