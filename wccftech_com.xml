			<p>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have released a brand new <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-the-masquerade-of-seattle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer diary</a> for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, where you can hear about Phyre's role as the Sheriff from Project Design Director, Level Designer, Environment Artist, and Game Designer. Each member breaks down the mechanics of the game and what role Phyre plays as a whole. Alongside the developer diary, The Chinese Room has released a Community Talks video, which talks about the work that the Environment Art team has done. You can find this video below, which goes into detail about the art of Seattle.</p>
<p><iframe title="TCR Community Talks 3: The Environment Art of our Seattle" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDC2TzniBu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest dev diary takes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-content-expansion-plans-to-be-announced-in-2025/">total up to 26</a>, which dives into detail about the city, the inhabitants found residing there, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNzggacI-EU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rules</a> that they have to follow. There are some main mechanics that are implemented by the Masquerade, which will be noticeable throughout your time in the game to keep you in check. To be able to continue through Bloodlines 2, you need to maintain the Masquerade. If you don't, you will die. However, to keep you in line with this fulfillment, there will be a Masquerade meter at the top of the screen, which will be color-coded so that you know how careful you have to be around Seattle.</p>
<p>Phyre's job as Sheriff means that they have to keep the peace, which includes snuffing out attempts to breach the Masquerade from the outside. This includes gangs causing trouble, assaults in the public eye, and more. To handle these situations, quick thinking is required, as well as the ability to be discreet and not draw attention to the ongoing situation.</p>
<p>It's a known fact that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 takes place in Seattle. To make it easier to navigate, the developers have split Seattle up into five districts: Uptown, Downtown, Chinatown, Financial, and Industrial. Each district offers something unique, including its own dangers that may not be found in other districts in the city.</p>
<p>There will be key locations that can be found in each district, from pawn shops and nightclubs in their respective districts. While some may be hoping for some pretty pictures taken in the Space Needle, Seattle has been designed to be darker and grungier than ever, a suitable spot for vampires to lurk in the shadows.</p>
<p>The next developer diary for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released on February 26, 2025. This diary will be diving into the cast of mortals, and the roles they play in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/exoborne-playtest-now-live-on-steam-ends-february-17/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Sharkmob and Level Infinite have announced that the tactical open-world extraction shooter Exoborne will have an open playtest, which will be available for players to dive into until 17 February. Unfortunately, this playtest is only available via Steam on PC, but the sign-up process for those who have access to it is incredibly easy to sign up, as you just have to visit the Steam page for Exoborne and press the "Request Access" button. This playtest is available worldwide. If you want to see what you can expect from your time in Exoborne, make sure to check out the new trailer below, which has been released specifically to celebrate the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne Playtest | Live Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXp6CC66gVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the trailer, Sharkmob has released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqnPjrA29k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 minute long video</a> that is a walkthrough of the gameplay, showcasing some of the main features that you can expect to experience in the game. This is the second title to be developed by Sharkmob, with the first being the short-lived Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt. Exoborne was first announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/exoborne-is-a-tactical-open-world-extraction-shooter-in-development-at-sharkmob/">two years ago</a>, and there have been minimal details about the game since.</p>
<p>This five-day global playtest will provide a lot of valuable feedback to the developers, as well as critiques and reports of any bugs that may be present during the playtest.</p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about Exoborne, this title is set to be an open-world, tactical extraction shooter that takes place in a ravaged world that was torn apart by extreme forces of nature. As a result, you need to customize and adapt your exo-rig to be able to gain an advantage over other players and to be able to sustain yourself during devastating weather changes.</p>
<p>Compared to other battle royales, Exoborne offers the opportunity to navigate a world with unprecedented verticality, which provides plenty of new opportunities for exploration, hiding spots, and advantages to gain against your opponents.</p>
<p>As you progress through the game, your progress will continue to unlock new gear and equipment that will benefit you in your future sessions.</p>
<p>While a fair amount of battle royales don't have a story, Exoborne has an ever-evolving story, which will help set the scene for any future content updates and mysteries that are uncovered in the world of Exoborne.</p>
<p>At the moment, Exoborne doesn't have a set release date, and the game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into the playtest for this new battle royale?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced several major changes coming to Overwatch 2 with Season 15, which is due to begin on Tuesday, February 18.</p>
<p>By far the most significant addition, described by the studio as the biggest gameplay innovation since the franchise launch, is in-match Perks. While in a match, players will now level up two times, gaining hero-specific bonuses that are meant to provide greater strategic depth.</p>
<p>With the first level up, the player will get to pick between two minor Perks. For example, with Torbjorn, they can either choose 'Craftsman' (Forge Hammer restores armor health to allies and the turret repair heal is improved by 25%) or 'Fully Loaded' (activating Overload completely refills the Rivet Gun's ammunition). Another example shared is Lucio's 'Bass Blowout', which increases the knockback of his Soundwave skill.</p>
<p>With the second level up, Overwatch 2 will offer a choice between two major Perks. In the case of Torbjorn, you'll be able to pick 'Anchor Bolts' (increasing the throw range of Deploy Turret by 50% and allowing it to be attached to walls and ceilings) or 'Level 3 Turret' (which will transform your turret into level 3 for five seconds when using Overload). With Reaper, the 'Dire Triggers' Perk gives him a Secondary Fire that does decent mid-range damage and is great for getting that last shot on an escaping foe.</p>
<p>Blizzard said that the Perks concept originated in early 2024, though most of the project came together in the last six months. It went through several stages of trial and error; for instance, Perks was initially just a leveling system featuring predetermined upgrades. However, that version of the system lacked player choice, which is what the team focused on adding for the final version.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Perks_Torbjorn_Major-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Blizzard also shared some of their favorite Perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winston's Chain Lightning lets him charge up Secondary Fire to zap multiple enemies near his target.</li>
<li>Hanzo's Scatter Arrows will make for some great multi-kill clips.</li>
<li>With Baptiste's Shoulder Turret, when using Amplification Matrix, the turret comes out to add extra Automated Healing.</li>
<li>Ramattra's Vengeful Vortex enables players to explode Ravenous Vortex in the air and send down any flying enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you were wondering, these Overwatch 2 in-match Perks will be available in both Competitive and Quick Play modes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/OVR_PK_S15_GalaxyWeaponSkin_Hanzo_001-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Season 15 will mark the beginning of this year's competitive season for the game, bringing with it a Ranked reset, new competitive Galactic Weapons designed to give players the power of the stars, competitive rank Weapon Charms, and new Player Portraits.</p>
<p>Players will be able to join the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-will-run-two-6v6-tests-in-season-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6v6</a> Competitive queue as well as Overwatch Classic: GOATS. Moreover, Loot Boxes are coming back, being available via weekly and event rewards, as well as earning 1 Legendary Loot Box in the Free Battle Pass and an additional 2 Legendary Loot Boxes in the Premium Battle Pass.</p>
<p>The Overwatch 2 team has already shared the official Loot Boxes drop rates in an attempt at transparency:</p>
<table id="table_1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.95"><strong>Loot Boxes</strong></td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.93"><strong>Legendary Loot Boxes</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.67">Legendary - 5.10%</td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.6">Legendary - 100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.69">Epic - 21.93%</td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.54">Epic - 21.93%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.79">Rare - 96.26%</td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.81">Rare - 96.26%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.83">Common - 97.97%</td>
<td title="Character Accurarcy=99.81">Common - 97.97%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Moreover, Blizzard said that a Rare or better item is guaranteed to drop in every single box, with an Epic item within five consecutive boxes and a Legendary item within twenty consecutive boxes.</p>

<p>That's not all Bizzard discussed today. The developers also outlined major additions coming later this year with Season 16, starting with the brand new Stadium game mode. Stadium is meant to be a wholly different way to experience Overwatch 2, starting with the camera, which, for the first time in the franchise, will default to a third-person view (although switchable at any moment to the familiar first-person view). Blizzard says that the new perspective slightly slows down the pace of action while also allowing players to better see the more iconic abilities of their hero.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stadium_Dva_1p-and-3p-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Stadium is played 5v5 in a best-of-7 format (with role queue) where players will earn in-game currency each round to purchase and customize abilities. These are powerful upgrades that can alter your character's survivability and damage output and even completely overhaul their skills. Stadium features a redesigned and intuitive user interface and icons, allowing players to seamlessly view, buy and sell mods (which include Items, Hero Items, and Powers), as well as see the builds of your rival team's builds to maximize your strategy from round to round.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stadium_Armory_Customization_3-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Stadium also features its own Ranked Mode with multiple divisions, ranks, and unique rewards.<br>
There will be at least 14 core heroes when Stadium launches in Season 16. Over time, Blizzard plans to introduce more heroes, maps, and modes.</p>
<p>Season 16 will bring even more to Overwatch 2, including a brand new Hero called Freya. She's a former search and rescue operative turned bounty hunter, equipped with an explosive crossbow and unique abilities. Her abilities include&nbsp;Take Aim, which can be used to line up the perfect shot and fire a high-speed explosive bolt; Quick Dash, a dodge that also reloads Freya's explosive bolt; and Bola Shot, which grabs enemies. Freya can also use wind updrafts to propel herself into the sky. While she's slated to join the roster in Season 16, players will be able to check her out during a free trial weekend later in Season 15.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/OVR_PK_S15_H43_Freja_002-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Blizzard even teased another character, currently codenamed Aqua. This one is a Chinese hero featuring water-based abilities. He's currently slated to launch in Season 18. Season 16 will also see the arrival of Hero Bans in Competitive Mode. Later in 2025, Blizzard will add a new Map Voting system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/aqua_concept-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Overall, it seems that the developers have been hard at work revamping Overwatch 2 in various ways. Whether this will be enough to reignite interest in the game remains to be seen.</p>
