			<p>In the <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fiscal-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new financial report</a> for the second quarter of Take Two's fiscal year 2025, they have announced that they've sold Private Division,<a href="https://wccftech.com/private-division-is-likely-to-be-sold-or-closed-down-by-take-two/"> the company</a> behind games like OlliOlli World and, more recently, No Rest for the Wicked, which was only released in Early Access on PC in April 2024. At the moment, the buyer of Private Division is completely undisclosed, and it remains a mystery as to who could have bought them out. However, Take-Two Interactive has stated that they have purchased "substantially all of Private Divisions live and unreleased titles." This message comes with the confirmation that support for No Rest for the Wicked will continue, and the support will be continued by Take-Two themselves.</p>
<p>The stated reason for selling Private Division is that the company now wants to focus on the "core and mobile businesses for the long term." Management of Take-Two has stated that the company remains "exceedingly well-positioned for the long-term," which a clear vision in mind, and has "one of the strongest portfolios of owned intellectual property in our industry."</p>
<p>When it comes to finances, Take-Two has mentioned that they have made $1.47 billion in Net Bookings with outperformance from both the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises. GTA VI is a game that is highly anticipated by fans of the franchise, with the first trailer being shown earlier this year. However, since that trailer, there have been very few details about the game. Additionally, this year saw the release of the Borderlands movie, which didn't exactly perform as they had hoped.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to report that we delivered strong second-quarter results. Our Net Bookings of $1.47 billion were at the top of our guidance range, driven by the continued success of the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises, and our operating results surpassed our plans, largely due to a shift in the timing of marketing expenses within the year," says Strauss Zelnic, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>With this in mind, they have reiterated that they are expecting a massive increase in Net Bookings for the fiscal year 2025 and have hoped to make $5.55 to $5.65 billion. The report also states the upcoming release dates for Take-Two's future lineup, including Civilization VII, WWE 2K25, and, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-sales-not-affected-by-launch-window-take-two-ceo-believes-expects-game-to-move-consoles-aplenty/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is due out in the Fall of 2025.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is whether selling Private Division will lead to layoffs within the company. Unfortunately, this is a typical cycle when companies are sold or acquired by others in the industry.</p>
