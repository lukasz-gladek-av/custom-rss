			<p><strong>Update 24/12/2025 3:36 pm EST - </strong>The Steam store and website are back online. Altogether, the store was only offline for a little over an hour. You can go back to redeeming those gift cards and squeezing every cent out of them during the Winter Sale.</p>



<p>That said, we may not be entirely out of the woods yet, so if you're still having issues, maybe just give it a little more time.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>If you're sat at home trying to peruse the Steam Winter Sale, but can't get anything beyond a black screen on the Steam app or an Error message on the website, fret not - it's not your family home's poor WiFi. <strong>Steam is currently down,</strong> and it's unclear as to when it'll be back online.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no notice from Valve as to what is causing the issue, as Steam and the website have been down for the past hour. Thousands of reports have been flooding <a href="https://downdetector.ca/status/steam/">DownDetector</a> since the issues started, and the <a href="https://steamstat.us/">unofficial status on SteamDB</a> shows that over 250K people have visited the site to see what's happening with Steam.</p>



<p>It's an unfortunate time for the digital storefront to be offline, as surely there are millions of players around the world excited to redeem their gift cards for the digital storefront and see what they can knock off their wishlist at a supreme discount.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thankfully, the Winter Sale doesn't end until January 5, 2026, by which time you can expect Valve to have fixed whatever is causing the issue. In the meantime, if you haven't already, you can head over to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">the Epic Games Store to redeem today's free game, The Callisto Protocol</a>. </p>



<p>And once you're done that, you can continue waiting for Steam to be back online, since, <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/">as <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong> explained in a recent interview,</a> the Epic Games Store isn't a home for PC players, but Steam is.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>People are not, basically, using EGS as their home, it’s not home to them. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but EGS doesn’t have written reviews. They don’t have the forums. There’s nothing to do there but to buy. So that will always lose to a shop that is also emotional and you can basically engage with the shop</em>. <em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll update this article if Valve provides any notice as to why the store is down and how long it may take them to fix the problem, or if the store just magically starts working again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Merry Christmas Eve, The Callisto Protocol Is Free Today on the Epic Games Store]]></title>

			<p>The Epic Games Store is continuing its annual tradition of giving away one game each day over the holiday period, and on the night before Christmas, it's Striking Distance Studio's maligned spiritual successor to Dead Space: <strong>The Callisto Protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>Epic kicked off this year's barrage of free games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/">with Hogwarts Legacy</a> the night of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025,</a> which was free from the night of the show, December 11, until December 18. Following that, on December 18, Epic began giving away one free game a day. So far, the store has given away:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Dec. 11-18)</li>



<li>Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel (Dec. 18)</li>



<li>Eternights (Dec. 19)</li>



<li>Blood West (Dec. 20)</li>



<li>Sorry We're Closed (Dec. 21)</li>



<li>Paradise Killer (Dec. 22) </li>



<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Dec. 23)</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol (Dec. 24)</li>
</ul>



<p>The Callisto Protocol is arguably the biggest game to be given away since Hogwarts Legacy kicked things off, though, as a Christmas Eve giveaway, it is a tad disappointing considering it has previously been a free giveaway game on the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>Tomorrow's giveaway for Christmas Day, and the final game that will be given away on January 1, 2026, are usually the bigger titles compared to everything else, with previous years gifting players games like Death Stranding Director's Cut.</p>



<p>If you've never played The Callisto Protocol, then you can't really go wrong with picking it up for free. Yes, it did so poorly that <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-the-callisto-protocol-directed-his-last-game/">it may go down as Glen Schofield's final game</a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocols-metacritic-score-caused-publisher-kraftons-stock-to-go-down/">Metacritic score may have been the cause for Krafton's stock to take a dip</a>, and yes, even <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">Schofield admitted that it was pushed out the door too early</a>.</p>



<p>But for all its faults and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">resulting consequences</a>, if you're a fan of horror games, then it's worth your time to give The Callisto Protocol a try. It definitely doesn't reach the heights of Dead Space, but it's focus on melee combat over ranged cranks up the tension, and if you have the hardware for it (<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-the-callisto-protocol-patch-5-03-addresses-pc-ray-tracing-crashes-and-further-improves-performance/">now that its biggest issues have been patched out</a>), it is a stunning visual treat of a game.</p>



<p>As Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">highlighted in his review back in 2022</a>, "<em>One area that The Callisto Protocol absolutely excels in, however, is in the overall presentation and graphical design. There's nary a single square inch of Callisto and Black Iron Prison that doesn't capture that derelict, abandoned spaceship vibes, complete with ambient sounds of creaking pipes or rustling footsteps in the far distance.</em>"</p>
