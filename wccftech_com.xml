			<p>During the State of Play Japan broadcast that aired a few hours ago, Sony announced a 27-inch PlayStation Gaming Monitor that will launch next year in the United States and Japan. No pricing has been revealed yet, but we do know its specifications:</p>



<ul>
<li>Quad High Definition (QHD) IPS display with a resolution of up to 2560 x 1440, allowing players to game at a comfortable viewing distance from their desk.</li>



<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR) support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping, which automatically adjusts HDR settings during setup on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, ensuring a rich and vivid picture quality.</li>



<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support and refresh rates of up to 120 Hz for smooth and seamless gameplay on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, and 240 Hz on compatible PC and Mac devices.</li>



<li>Built-in Charging Hook for a DualSense or DualSense Edge wireless controller (sold separately), making it easy for players to get right into gaming.</li>
</ul>



<p>The PlayStation Gaming Monitor is equipped with two 2.1 HDMI IN ports and one 1.4 DisplayPort IN port for compatibility with PlayStation 5, PC, Mac, or other devices. The 2.1 HDMI IN ports support up to 2560×1440 resolution, 240Hz frame rate, Fixed Rate Link (FRL), and VRR; the 1.4 DisplayPort IN port supports up to 2560×1440 resolution, 240Hz frame rate, and Display Stream Compression (DSC).</p>



<p>You'll also find two USB Type-A and one USB Type-C port that can be used with PlayStation Link Adapters or other devices. The display is compatible with select VESA mounting systems to mount it on a wall, for instance. When it comes to audio, there's a built-in stereo speaker and 3.5mm audio output, but Sony recommends pairing it with the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-unveils-pulse-elvate-wireless-speakers-built-in-mic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pulse Elevate Wireless Speakers</a>. This set features planar magnetic drivers and a built-in microphone, and it's also due to launch in 2026.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Spec-wise, the PlayStation Gaming Monitor is undoubtedly a step down from <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-m10s-oled-m9-ii-gaming-monitors-launched-up-to-4k-480hz-with-dp-2-1-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony's Inzone M10S OLED and M9 II monitors</a> released last year. However, it's also likely to be significantly more affordable, although we'll have to wait for official pricing news to know exactly how much it will cost.</p>



<p>During the aforementioned State of Play, Sony also announced a new, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-launching-cheaper-japanese-language-only-digital-ps5-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaper Japan-only version of the PlayStation 5</a>. Publisher Bandai Namco also <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled a DLC for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>.</p>
