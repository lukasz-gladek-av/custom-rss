			<p>Today, publisher A Plus announced the Western release date of the free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol: Star Resonance. The game will be available in Europe, North America, and South America via PC (Steam, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blue-protocol-star-resonance-27bff9?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) and mobile (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-protocol-star-resonance/id6744962482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpsr.apj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>) starting October 9. The studio had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-star-resonance-release-date-october-mobile-pre-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the game would be released in October, but now fans have the exact day.</p>



<p>As you might recall, Blue Protocol was originally developed by Bandai Namco Online Studios. It launched two years ago in Japan,&nbsp;only on PC. Amazon Games was supposed to&nbsp;publish&nbsp;the game for PC and consoles in Western countries, but it was completely unsuccessful in Japan and&nbsp;was thus <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-is-being-shut-down-in-japan-and-the-western-launch-is-canceled/">shut down</a>, seemingly preventing the Western debut as well.</p>



<p>However, earlier this year, developer Shanghai Bokura Network Technology <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-star-resonance-lives-again-will-launch-this-year-on-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> the game rights to launch Blue Protocol: Star Resonance for PC and mobile devices, effectively reviving the project.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are some differences between Star Resonance and the original game, though. Firstly, the business model, which was supposed to be buy-to-play and is now free-to-play with gacha monetization system. On the upside, Shanghai Bokura Network Technology created a seamless open world environment, whereas Blue Protocol had segmented explorable zones, and also added traversal mechanics like gliding.</p>



<p>The action combat system is faster-paced now, featuring more complex boss mechanics and a detailed endgame with PvE raids. The original's hybrid class roles have also been overhauled into a stricter MMO-like "holy trinity" (tank, support, damage). Finally, the narrative is different as well.</p>



<p>For now, there's been no mention of a console launch, but that does not mean it will not happen in the future. Of course, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance would have to succeed on PC and mobile first before the developer and publisher could consider an expansion to console platforms at a later time.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-players-will-have-to-buy-the-game-again-to-play-on-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-players-will-have-to-buy-the-game-again-to-play-the-1-0-release-on-steam.1299513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/">Battlestate announced</a> that after nine years of early access, Escape from Tarkov is launching out of early access, with a 1.0 release on Steam coming on November 15, 2025. However, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1967958727295950963">Jake Lucky on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, if you wanted to play Escape from Tarkov on Steam to keep all of your games in one place, you'll have to buy the game again.</p>



<p>As explained on the <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/support/knowledge/542">FAQ</a> for the coming release, Battlestate confirms that if you do plan to continue playing the game on Steam, you'll be able to access your profile by linking your Battlestate account, but you'll have to buy the game again in the first place.</p>



<p>"<em>Yes. To play Escape from Tarkov through Steam, you must purchase any edition of the game on Steam. You can then link your existing Battlestate Games account with an active copy of the game to your Steam profile. If the editions differ, it will automatically use the higher edition of the two when launching the game through Steam.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, you can just keep playing the game on the Battlestate launcher. Nothing is forcing you to buy the game a second time, though it's unfortunate for anyone who prefers to keep their games all in one place.</p>



<p>What's important is that after all this time, another game that seemed stuck in a perpetual early access period is finally crossing over to the other side of 1.0. Hopefully, when the launch date arrives, it all goes well.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-launch-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/survios-debuts-new-alien-rogue-incursion-%E2%80%93-part-one-evolved-edition-launch-trailer-adds-xbox-series-x-s-version.1299420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One was first released by developer Survios towards the end of 2024 on PlayStation VR2 and PCVR, before arriving on Meta Quest in February 2025. Now, it's making the jump out of VR headsets, with its new <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-announced-no-vr-headset-needed/">Evolved Edition</a> version arriving on PC, PlayStation 5, and, as was just announced, Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>The Evolved Edition will arrive on all three platforms at the end of the month on September 30, 2025, and ahead of that release, Survios has debuted a new launch trailer showing off more gameplay of the new version and announcing its Xbox release.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As we near the Evolved Edition's release, we get closer to the one-year mark of Part One's initial launch, with no word on how Part Two is coming along. Interestingly, players who were there for Part One right at launch didn't even know it was the first of two parts. Survios only broke the news when the game launched, claiming it was always the plan to tell Alien: Rogue Incursion's story in two parts.</p>



<p>Survios also <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-evolved-edition-gameplay-release-date-ps5-pc/">confirmed to Wccftech earlier this year</a> that, while those players who expected to get a game that was part one-of-one when they bought it in December 2024 wait for Part Two, if they want to try out the Evolved Edition to enjoy the experience again without the hassle of the headset, they'll have to purchase the game again. At the time of this writing, if you bought the VR version, you don't get the Evolved Edition as a free update, nor is there a discounted upgrade path. You'll just have to grab it again at $39.99.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate, but hopefully, whenever Part Two rolls around, the flat-screen version and VR version are released as a package, so there's no need for these multiple iterations.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Borderlands 4 is out in the wild, and while it's enjoyed some <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">commercial</a> success right at launch, its launch has also been a bit of a mess with technical issues galore. That's unfortunately not uncommon for major triple-A releases, but what hasn't been improving the situation is how Gearbox boss, Randy Pitchford, has been responding to it.</p>



<p>Pitchford has a history of making comments online to players that don't always go over so well, and we don't have to turn the clock back too far to remember the last time his comments caused a stir with Borderlands 4. Last time, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">about the game's price</a>. This time, he's telling <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">"<em>4K stubborn</em>"</a> players that it's actually their fault that the game his studio released isn't running very well.</p>



<p>Most studios, when they launch a big game that has technical issues, put their heads down and get on with fixing it, and that's what Gearbox is doing, but most studios also don't have to deal with their boss going online and making players even more upset about the whole situation. It's not what anyone on the Gearbox team had in mind for launch, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-feels-bad-for-borderlands-4-devs-who-are-just-trying-really-hard-to-make-players-happy-as-randy-pitchford-fights-back-against-performance-criticism/">Gamesradar</a>, it has Baldur's Gate 3's publishing director, Michael Douse, feeling bad for the rest of the team trying to get the game fixed, and ensure that players have the best experience possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Just lock Randy in a cupboard for 6 months,</em>" Douse commented on X (formerly Twitter). When some responded that Pitchford is better off not being cut off, and that they prefer his honesty over an corporate-approved message, Douse agreed, but clarified, "<em>I feel bad for his teams who are just trying really hard to make players happy</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the one hand, Pitchford's brand of unmitigated honesty stands out because it's not what you hear from almost anyone else in the industry. Game development is hard, and Pitchford telling players to do it themselves if they think it's so easy isn't exactly an unfair response. Even the biggest studio with the biggest team is going to miss major and minor technical problems. It's not easy work, and players are often too quick to forget that.</p>



<p>But it's not like Borderlands 4 just has a few frame rate problems, and players are spending their hard-earned money on a game that should at least run without crashing. It's getting fixed, and that's great, but that doesn't take the sting away from knowing you've spent money on something broken. Though, as Pitchford has told players who have an issue with it, they can "<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510"><em>Please get a refund from Steam</em>"</a> if they want.</p>
