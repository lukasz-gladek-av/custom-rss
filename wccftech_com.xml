			<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1952716473656385840">announced</a> that it would be hosting a Nintendo Indie World Direct on Thursday, August 7, 2025, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST. Like its previous indie-focused presentations, it'll be a shorter, 15-minute long direct, with updates and announcements for several indie games, but according to Nintendo-focused creator and leaker Switchforce, don't expect one of those games to be Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>



<p>Last week, Nintendo hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase Direct</a>, which included several announcements from its third-party partners, like the release date reveal for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-september-5/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a new Octopath Traveler game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">Monster Hunter Stories 3's</a> reveal, and a new HD-2D action-RPG from Square Enix called <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, to name a few.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was technically a showcase where Silksong could have shown up, but like many other potential games that could've appeared, it was absent. Tomorrow's Indie World direct is the second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, and while it's once again another place where Silksong could appear, Switchforce claims that it's not going to happen.</p>



<p>"<em>You do not have Hollow Knight: Silksong being shown off this Thursday, I'll just tell you that right now. I know some people are getting very excited, but as far as I'm aware, that is not in the cards.</em>"</p>

<iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Just Got Even Better â€” And Thereâ€™s MORE ComingðŸ‘€" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tuvr5j3HvXQ?start=203&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Switchforce continues to point out a key factor as to why we probably won't see it tomorrow, which is the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Silksong is confirmed to be at Gamescom 2025</a>, and that there will be a demo available for attendees to check out the game themselves. If any Silksong news is coming soon, it'll likely happen at the same event where people could immediately try it out after learning of a release date, for example.</p>



<p>So if you're anxiously awaiting any spec of news on Silksong, keep your anxieties under control until <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom ONL 2025</a> on August 19, 2025. Silksong is very likely to grace that showcase, since those at Gamescom will be able to watch the new trailer, potentially have a release date to look forward to, and then try it out for themselves on the show floor the next day.</p>



<p>Which is hopefully what happens. It's been years of players waiting and hoping to see Silksong at every big showcase, whether it's a Nintendo showcase or not. It'll be good to put this all to bed when we finally get a release date, and when Silksong is finally on store shelves. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starfield Could Be Getting a Higly Requested Feature in the Future]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-highly-requested-feature/</link>

			<p>Starfield could be getting a highly requested feature in <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-bethesda-reiterates-exciting-things/">future patches</a>, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>As reported on the game's subreddit, plenty of evidence has been found in the code of the latest two updates which suggests that an <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-mod-interplanetary-engines-adds-in-system-travel-without-using-the-console/">interplanetary travel mechanic</a> that would allow players to travel between two different planets in the same system, which is a feature many have been asking for since the game's release, could be in the works. Sadly, seamless space to planet surface landing doesn't seem to be in the works, at least going by the game's current code, so we shouldn't expect the game by Bethesda to suddenly turn into Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky anytime soon, if ever.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although there's the chance that this feature will never make it into the game for any reason, the fact that a new big feature is seemingly in the works aligns with other rumors that have been circulating on Starfield these past few weeks. Reportedly, new quality-of-life improvements are coming to the game, alongside a second expansion, when the game will debut on PlayStation 5 during <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">Spring 2026</a>. The PlayStation 5 release was originally planned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">this year</a>, but a decision to delay this new version of the game to 2026 was made folliwing the low sales of the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space</a>.</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">I did enjoy Starfield</a>&nbsp;when it launched in 2023, my opinion of the game soured rather quickly as I returned to it before the launch of the Shattered Space expansion, which did little to alleviate the base game's most critical issues. Hopefully, the rumored new quality of life improvements and the new expansion will breathe new life into a game that has yet to achieve the full potential its solid foundation offers.</p>
