			<p>Over the years, the Styx series has become the series for those looking for involving stealth gameplay. Cyanide's hardcore approach to stealth mechanics prevented the series from being popular among audiences that weren't the stealth games fanatics, but it's undeniable that this approach, combined with a dark fantasy setting and a chatty, irreverent main character, made the series what it is.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-gamescom-hands-on-preview-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/"><strong>After having had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed</strong></a>, the next entry in the series, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-delayed-out-of-2025-now-set-to-arrive-in-february-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">now set to launch this February on PC and consoles</strong></a>, I couldn't help but notice how Cyanide wasn't going to compromise on its hardcore approach to widen the series' appeal. The contrary, actually. </p>



<p>While Styx continues to be the likeable goblin rogue he has always been, everything else has been expanded considerably, with an open-world setting with sandbox features that provides new challenges, but also new tools to dispose of surprisingly attentive enemies that leave no stone unturned if they believe to have spotted something suspicious. This early build was unsurprisingly a little rough around the edges, but the experience's potential was evident.</p>



<p>Last month, I was given a second chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed before its release. While in terms of content this new build wasn't different from the one I tried during Gamescom 2025, except for a new intro sequence teaching the game's basics while setting up the story, the prior experience (and the more relaxed testing environment) made me appreciate even more the focus on verticality, and the sandbox design of the Slums, where the build's main mission takes place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Styx-Blades-of-Greed-January-Hands-On-Gameplay.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As part of this build's main mission, Styx is supposed to talk with a drunken dwarf who is staying at a nearby tavern to recover the Zeppelin. With little knowledge of the game mechanics, in my Gamescom 202 test, I went through the tavern's main door, using every opportunity to distract enemies to make it to the dwarf's room, with some difficulty, as the enemies have solid AI that makes them smarter than your usual enemy in non-stealth-focused games. However, now knowing where the room is, I took a completely different approach. </p>



<p>Taking advantage of the map's verticality, I climbed the tavern from the outside, making sure to crouch under windows to avoid enemies spotting me. This approach provided not only a different experience but also highlighted how the sandbox design of Styx: Blades of Greed will allow players to complete missions in any way they like.</p>



<p>The second part of the mission, which involved taking down all enemies in a somewhat closed-off location with an intricate design with multiple passages between rooms, likewise showed how many options are at Styx's disposal to take enemies out, even without using any of the special abilities that can be learned via the different skill trees or new tools like the grappling hook and the glider. One option I didn't see back in the Gamescom 2025 build is the ability to poison food, which highlights once more how varied the player's approach can be to clear missions.</p>



<p>Besides being able to appreciate better what Styx: Blades of Greed tries to do, the new build also showcased a higher degree of polish over the Gamescom 2025 demo, with little to no visual and gameplay glitches. Unfortunately, I can't really evaluate the game's performance, as the preview was conducted via cloud streaming; however, things felt smooth enough, even with multiple characters on screen.</p>



<p>While I don't expect Styx: Blades of Greed to set the market on fire, as its hardcore stealth approach is still going to leave anyone who isn't a stealth game fanatic frustrated, the new entry in the series by Cyanide seems to evolve the series' formula considerably, providing a sandbox stealth experience that works incredibly well with its wealth of options. </p>



<p>As such, I am looking forward to seeing what the game will offer beyond what I have already experienced twice, and whether the map and encounter design will hold up as well as they do in these missions when it launches on February 19 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>No matter if you prefer linear intense experiences, super-hero games, stealth games, or immersive open-worlds to lose yourself in, you are sure to find some great games to play in the next 12 months.</p>



<p>Here are our <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">five most anticipated action games releasing in 202</strong>6.</p>

<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-september-9-2026-pc-playstation-5">Phantom Blade Zero (September 9, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5) </h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Phantom-Blade-Zero.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With its intense action combat and incredible animations, Phantom Blade 0 is looking like the best "pure" action game launching this year</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> made more than a few heads turn when it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/">revealed in May 2023</a>,</strong> with its distinctive style <strong>blending traditional kung fu with steampunk and cyberpunk</strong>. However, many dismissed it as yet another <strong>soulslike</strong>. Fortunately, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/">this won't be the case</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Edging closer to a more <strong>traditional action game</strong> than a soulslike, the game in development by S-Game is setting out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/"><strong>one of the best games of the current console generation</strong></a>, featuring intense action, linear yet articulate level design, exceptional enemy encounter design that forces players to employ every game mechanic effectively, epic boss battles and some of the smoothest animation in video games.</p>



<p>Though in the works by what is essentially an unproven team, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> truly has everything to <strong>succeed</strong> when <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-slashes-its-way-on-pc-and-playstation-5-this-september/"><strong>it launches this September.</strong></a></p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-q3-q4-2026-playstation-5">Marvel's Wolverine (Q3/Q4 2026 - PlayStation 5)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Marvels-Wolverine.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Starring one of the most iconic Marvel Comics characters ever, Marvel's Wolverine is set to become one of the most successful action games of 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Marvel's Spider-Man</em> series</strong></a>, Insomniac Games is preparing to branch out with a new game starring <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the most beloved Marvel Comics characters</strong> that shares very little with Peter Parker's and Miles Morales' adventures.</p>



<p>Seemingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/"><strong>ditching the open-world</strong></a> of <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>, <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em> will take <strong>a third-person action adventure route</strong> where players control the legendary Logan, explore a variety of locations, meet an ensemble cast of Marvel Comics characters, and gruesomely take down enemies using his <strong>superior strength and Adamantium Claws</strong>. With the vehicle traversal and varied locations teased in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">last year's gameplay trailer</a></strong>, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about the game.</p>



<p>With <strong>Sony's first-party premier action-adventure game series not receiving new entries this year</strong>, <em>Marvel's Wolverine</em> is undoubtedly <strong>the game to look out for for fans of the genre</strong>, even those who aren't too keen on the Marvel Comics universe.</p>

<p>For too long, <em>Crimson Desert</em> has been a huge unknown, but from what we have seen so far, the game has <strong>a high chance of being one of the best open-world action games </strong>in this packed 2026.</p>
