            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-launches-new-dungeon-sundered-doctrine/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last Friday saw the release of the newest dungeon in Destiny 2, titled Sundered Doctrine. In this dungeon, Savathûn guides the Guardians through a Pyramid ship filled with Dread. Alongside the release of this dungeon, an official Dungeon Race will take place, where fireteams will be competing against each other to complete the activity with Contest Mode enabled. The first verified team that finishes the dungeon will receive a customized trophy. Those who complete Contest Mode within the first 48 hours will receive a special emblem and Exotic Weapon. Once the Contest Mode has been completed by a fireteam, Normal Mode will then unlock.</p>
<p>This content launched alongside Heresy, the new episodic content in Destiny 2 which followed on from<a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/"> Revenant</a> and Echoes.</p>
<p>For those who want to see the teams that competed, you can watch it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/evanf1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiktok</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For anyone who completes the dungeon by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the <a href="https://bungiestore.com/rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie Rewards</a> offer that will allow you to purchase the Sundered Doctrine assortment, which includes a work shirt, dungeon bracelet, and pin. Additionally, those who complete the Delver Title by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the Bungie Rewards offer to purchase the Sundered Doctrine Title Pin. Above is a picture of some of the gear that you can purchase should you complete the dungeon in the required timeframe.</p>
<p>Along with the Sundered Doctrine dungeon being launched in Destiny 2, Destiny 2: Heresy launched, which takes Guardians back to Oryx's flagship named the Dreadnaught. Along with this comes new weapons, gear, and subclass Aspects. There will also be new artifact mods to collect and help you become more powerful in-game.</p>
<p>For those who like group content, The Nether debuts as a three-player activity that you can participate in, where players are able to harness the power of the Taken and utilize it to disrupt Anchors and stop the Taken invasion. This event is inspired by the events of Shattered Realm and The Coil.</p>
<p>The Nether event will also feature randomized encounters to keep the content fresh, as well as unique challenges to undertake and opportunities to make your build even stronger by harnessing the strength of powerful boons.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Heresy, a trailer is available now that shows off some of the content you can expect, as well as the story elements&nbsp;that will feature in this new update of Destiny 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Heresy | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ovo-J5F2rRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

			<p>Whether it's finishing games you've already started, playing games in your backlog, or downloading game trials, there's something for everyone during the Nintendo Switch "Play On" campaign. This campaign has started today and is set to finish on March 23. Between now and the end date, there are tons of sales to look through, rewards to earn, and multiple activities to participate in for the Play On event.</p>
<p>During the next six weeks, there are a ton of discounted games on the Nintendo eShop, including some triple-A titles and some award-winning indies, providing something for everyone. Additionally, there is a new Game Trial and Platinum Points that will be rewarded to you for playing selected Nintendo titles. There will also be bonus Gold Points awarded to those who purchase a Nintendo Switch Online 12-month membership.</p>
<p>While there are a lot of people who have put their Nintendo Switch away to wait for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-out-priced-350/">the release of its successor</a>, the console still has plenty of life in it, with tons of games to try out that will most likely transfer over to the Nintendo Switch 2 when it releases.</p>
<p>Some of the sales during the Play On Sale include games like Just Dance 2025 Edition, OKAMI HD, Sonic x Shadow Generations, and Balatro, for example. For more information on the sales taking place over the next six weeks, make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Nintendo-eShop-Sale/Nintendo-eShop-Sale-1460557.html?srsltid=AfmBOor9comVMJkdBa3GSPxKRncSCo0RwgX6CTPxNFVelhYlg6jnre8Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo eShop</a>, where you can find all games that have been discounted during this sale.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be events taking place in some of Nintendo's biggest titles on the Switch. This includes special Valentine's themed items being available to purchase in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Additionally, players can receive shiny Pokemon such as Meloetta, Manaphy, and more as Mystery Gifts on Pokemon Home for completing the Pokedex in Pokemon titles on the Nintendo Switch. This does also include the paid DLC in both Pokemon Sword and Shield and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet if you want to complete the Pokedexes in their entirety.</p>
<p>Following on in the Pokemon theme, from February 14 to February 16, players will be able to participate in a Valentine's themed Milcery 5-star Tera Raid Battle in Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet.</p>
