			<p>This week, Chinese developer S-GAME hosted S-PARTY 2025, a two-day event in Beijing during which fans could get hands-on with the highly anticipated Phantom Blade Zero. IGN India has posted a 22-minute gameplay video from this new demo that shows some hidden boss fights, secret item discoveries, and new weapons. We've embedded it below.</p>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero is undoubtedly one of the most eagerly awaited games in the action RPG/Soulslike genre, although as you might recall, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stressed</a> that it is not to be considered a pure Soulslike game.</p>



<p>Last month, S-GAME CEO Soulframe <a href="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1937262120418312391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> exactly what he thinks the game is:</p>



<p><em>Phantom Blade Zero is neither a Soulslike game nor a traditional action game. I've always admired the creators who defined these genres. I spent years immersed in their work, drawing inspiration and learning from their brilliance. But in the process of making this game, we stumbled onto a path we never expected:<br>At first, we just wanted to make a game that brought 'hack and slash' Into a multi layered map. But once the animations and environmental assets came together, everything was "stitched together" by a strong cultural aesthetic — creating something that felt deeply familiar to us, yet is rarely seen or experienced in games.</em></p>



<p><em>Broadly speaking, it falls under the category of ARPGs. But more specifically, maybe it could create a new identity that is Wuxia Action Games? Because here you'll get to experience:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Leaping across rooftops under a rain of arrows; </em></li>



<li><em>Fighting off pursuers atop a speeding carriage;</em></li>



<li><em>Uncovering the truth behind an incident that shocked the world years ago; </em></li>



<li><em>And even more iconic cinema moments.</em></li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Soulframe also added that Phantom Blade Zero will feature three difficulty settings (Wayfarer, Gamechanger, and Hellwalker, although the latter is only unlocked for a second playthrough with New Game+), unlike traditional Soulslike titles.</p>



<p>The game still has no release window, but we might learn more at Gamescom, where S-GAME is set to bring a large presence with a massive 500 m² booth in Hall 6 (B-050G) featuring over 60 demo stations. The demo is said to be the most comprehensive shared publicly to date, a full 1-hour playable experience featuring all-new boss battles, striking level design, immersive storytelling, and visceral blade-to-blade combat.</p>



<p>We'll be at Gamescom and look forward to checking out the new demo after <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting on last year's Phantom Blade Zero hands-on</a>.</p>
