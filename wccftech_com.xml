			<p>Although the <strong>PC market</strong> has significantly gotten bigger over the years, consoles like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/">PlayStation 5</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/">Nintendo Switch</a></strong>, and its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">successor</a></strong> released last year continue to dominate the video games market as a whole in many regions of the world.</p>



<p>However, the increased number of releases on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC storefronts</strong> of the past few years indicates that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">something is shifting</strong>. So much so that some celebrated game creators believe that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC market has become dominant</strong> at this point.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19255-the-hundred-line-interview-kodaka-dlc-new-characters-routes-uchikoshi-switch-2">RPG Site</a></em></strong> focused on his latest game, <strong><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></strong>, <strong><em>Danganronpa</em></strong> series creator <strong>Kazutaka Kodaka</strong> was asked about the game's excellent PC port. His reply leaves no room for interpretation: <strong><em>"The market is dominated by PC now,"</em></strong> he said. <strong><em>"Releasing worldwide on Steam is essential."</em></strong></p>



<p>While <strong>Kodaka-san</strong> didn't add more about the matter, his confirmation that the team is <strong>not considering PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports</strong> of <strong><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></strong> makes it clear how much the market seems to be leaving traditional home consoles behind, <strong>shifting towards PC</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pc-become-the-unified-gaming-platform">Will PC Become the Unified Gaming Platform?</h2>



<p>Following the heights of the early 2020s, when people spent more time at home playing video games due to the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, the video game market has been experiencing some <strong>turbulent times</strong>, putting the traditional business model that has held so far in question.</p>



<p>A few days ago, former Chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios <strong>Shawn Layden</strong> highlighted in an interview how the <strong>total install base of console users hasn't changed much</strong> in the past few generations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-trapped-in-this-containment-field-former-sony-exec-proposes-single-gaming-format-to-expand-console-market/"><strong>proposing the creation of a consortium</strong></a> in the vein of those which pushed for unified formats like the <strong>VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray</strong> to make the video games industry move towards a <strong>single gaming format</strong> that could be licensed out.</p>



<p>With releasing games on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Steam for PC</strong> seemingly having become <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">essential</strong>, and both <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Microsoft and Sony</strong> increasing their focus on this market, it definitely feels like the industry may already be moving towards a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unified gaming format centered on the platform</strong>, whose appeal has further increased with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">handheld gaming systems</strong> like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck</a></strong> and <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbo</a></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">x</a></strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/"> Ally</a></strong>.</p>



<p>With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-ram-prices-could-be-the-next-big-problem-for-pc-gamers/">massive price spike for RAM</a></strong> due to the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-cost-increase-allegedly-behind-microsofts-rumored-new-massive-round-of-job-cuts/">AI craze</a></strong>, which is set to increase the price of almost every electronic device significantly, however, this move could be <strong>considerably delayed</strong>, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-industry-as-a-whole-is-concerned-about-ram-availability-heres-why-the-playstation-6-and-xbox-next-could-be-delayed-past-2027-2028/">current console generation could be extended</a></strong> until the situation normalizes.</p>

			<p>Like in the past few years, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA</strong> took advantage of this year's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Consumer Electronics Show</strong> to make some important announcements. While the company is not launching any new <span>GPUs in the near future, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong>it has </strong></a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/">announced</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/">&nbsp;<strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a>, which features a new iteration of the&nbsp;<strong>Transformer model,</strong>&nbsp;as well as new&nbsp;<strong>Multi-Frame</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Generation</strong> features exclusive to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 50 series</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-591-74-driver-now-available-with-dlss-4-5-support/"><strong>With new drivers</strong></a> and update to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">NVIDIA App</strong>, it is now possible to use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution</strong> thanks to new drivers with every game that supports <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS</strong>, delivering even <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">better image quality than native resolution</strong> in some cases, such as in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong>.</p>



<p>A new comparison video <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">created by&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmarkPC</strong>&nbsp;showcases the game running with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5,</strong>&nbsp;featuring the second-generation transformer model, side by side at&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1440p and 4K resolutions</strong>, with&nbsp;</span>ultra settings in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Quality, Balanced, and Performance</strong> modes on an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 5080</strong> GPU.</p>



<p>The considerable image quality improvements over <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong> are evident in the side-by-side comparison at <strong>1440p resolution</strong> in <strong>Quality mode</strong>, but even more impressive is how the new transformer model delivers <strong>better image quality than native resolution</strong>. This is easily noticeable with the <strong>terrain and grass</strong>, which look considerably sharper with <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Super Resolution transformer model</strong> isn't perfect, as it seems to have some trouble <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rendering leaves on trees</strong> correctly.

This performance impact, however, remains small on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 50 and 40 series</strong> thanks to the use of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">FP8</strong> in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blackwell and Ada GPUs</strong>.</p>

This is to be expected, considering this is the new model's first release, which is only going to get improved in the future.</p>

            <guid>1399132</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the earlier confirmation that Lara Croft <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be played by <strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> (Sansa Stark in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, Jean Grey in <strong>X-Men: Dark Phoenix</strong>) in <strong>Amazon</strong>'s upcoming <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> TV show, it has now been confirmed that <strong>Sigourney Weaver</strong> and <strong>Jason Isaacs</strong> have joined the main cast.</p>



<p>In a reveal exclusive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1q5jcp0/reddit_exclusive_new_cast_and_characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the official Tomb Raider subreddit</a>, Amazon outlined both roles from the existing gaming franchise and brand-new characters created specifically for the series. These are the picks for characters gamers will know very well:</p>



<ul>
<li>Martin Bobb-Semple is&nbsp;<strong>Zip</strong>, Lara Croft's long-standing tech support and friend.</li>



<li>Jason Isaacs is&nbsp;<strong>Atlas DeMornay</strong>, Lara's uncle.</li>



<li>Bill Paterson is&nbsp;<strong>Winston</strong>, the butler of the Croft family.</li>
</ul>



<p>And these are the actors cast in entirely new roles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Jack Bannon is&nbsp;<strong>Gerry</strong>, Lara's personal pilot (and snack collector).</li>



<li>John Heffernan is&nbsp;<strong>David</strong>, an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara's world.</li>



<li>Celia Imrie is&nbsp;<strong>Francine</strong>, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne.</li>



<li>Paterson Joseph is&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Warner</strong>, a senior government official brought in to clean up a mess.</li>



<li>Sasha Luss is&nbsp;<strong>Sasha</strong>, a fierce and deeply competitive new rival of Lara Croft.</li>



<li>Juliette Motamed is&nbsp;<strong>Georgia</strong>, a devoted curator at the British Museum, dedicated to preserving history.</li>



<li>Sigourney Weaver is&nbsp;<strong>Evelyn Wallis</strong>, a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's unique talents.</li>



<li>August Wittgenstein is&nbsp;<strong>Lukas</strong>, an illegal tomb raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tomb-raider-tv-cast.webp"></a></figure>



<p>Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs are by far the most famous among the newly announced cast. Weaver's breakthrough role was, of course, <strong>Alien's Ellen Ripley</strong>, although she also featured prominently in the <strong>Ghostbusters</strong> and <strong>Avatar</strong> franchises, as Dana Barrett and Dr. Grace Augustine, respectively. As for Jason Isaacs, he is mainly known as <strong>Julius Malfoy</strong> in the <strong>Harry Potter</strong> movie saga; he also received acclaim for playing Captain Gabriel Lorca in <strong>Star Trek: Discovery,</strong> and more recently, as Timothy Ratliff in the third season of HBO's <strong>The White Lotus</strong>. Isaacs also voiced Lord Enver Gortash, one of the main antagonists in <strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong>.</p>



<p>Amazon's announcement included messages from Sophie Turner and <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong>, the creator, writer, executive producer, and co-showrunner, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been attached to the show since early 2023</a>.</p>



<p><em><strong>Sophie Turner:</strong> I’ve been a long-time fan of Tomb Raider and the character of Lara. She has always felt for me, very emboldened in a male dominated world. She’s a fierce female role model!</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge:</strong> Tomb Raider boasts a plethora of iconic characters. I am thrilled to have been able to bring some personal and fan favourites to the screen while also introducing a few new rascals of our own to the mix. This cast is beyond my wildest dreams!</em></p>



<p>The TV show's debut season is slated to start production on <strong>January 19, 2026</strong>. Its release will therefore realistically happen at some point in 2027 on Amazon's Prime Video. Meanwhile, Lara Croft fans can revisit the first game in 2026's <strong>Legacy of Atlantis remake</strong> and prepare for a bombastic 2027 that will also see the release of a brand new game titled <strong>Catalyst</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>

			<p>A new rumor suggests <strong>Microsoft</strong> is preparing to use its <strong>layoff axe</strong> once again, for the <strong>fourth consecutive January</strong>, cutting between 11 and 22 thousand jobs across various divisions (including <strong>Xbox</strong>) because of the <strong>rising costs of AI investment</strong>. If the figures were confirmed, it would be the biggest layoff round yet.</p>



<p>The rumor <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes from TipRanks</a>, which adds that the layoffs are expected to fall upon employees at some point <strong>in the third week of January</strong>. According to workers' anonymous sources, even the <strong>Azure</strong> cloud team could be affected.</p>



<p>Analyst projections had previously suggested that Microsoft may need to cut at least 10,000 employees annually just to offset increased capital depreciation costs from data center expansion. Looking back over the past few years, the current <strong>fourth-largest company in the world by market capitalization</strong> reduced its workforce by 5% in <strong>2023</strong>, primarily as part of a resizing effort following the pandemic's mass hiring spree. That year in January, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-slashing-10k-jobs-bethesda-the-coaltion-343-industries-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started with 10,000 jobs lost</a>, when the gaming teams affected were <strong>Bethesda</strong>, <strong>The Coalition</strong> (developers of <strong>Gears of War</strong>), and <strong>343 Industries</strong> (developers of the <strong>Halo </strong>series). </p>



<p>In January <strong>2024</strong>, gaming really took the brunt of the hit as Microsoft 'only' <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut <strong>1,900 employees</strong></a>, around 1% of its workforce. It happened just three months after the finalization of the acquisition of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong>, which cost <strong>$75.4 billion</strong> when all was said and done. Activision Blizzard was indeed the most affected studio, with the new survival game franchise codenamed <strong>Odyssey</strong> canceled as a result, but other teams at Xbox and Bethesda also suffered cuts. The worst was yet to come for gaming, though: <strong>Arkane Austin</strong> (<strong>Prey</strong>, <strong>Redfall</strong>), <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong> (<strong>The Evil Within</strong>, <strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong>, <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>), <strong>Alpha Dog Games</strong>, and <strong>Roundhouse Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were all abruptly shut down in May 2024</a>. Later that year, around 1,000 employees were removed from the HoloLens and Azure cloud teams, and another 650 from corporate and support divisions, but it was still a relatively quiet year compared to the other two for Microsoft as a whole.</p>



<p><span><strong>2025</strong>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<strong>by far the worst</strong>, and it once again began with a January cut of slightly less than 1% of Microsoft's employees based on performance.</span> That was just the start: 3% of the workforce was cut in May, and an even heavier blow landed in July, when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed another 4% of its employees</a>, shutting down <strong>The Initiative</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">and its </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark reboot</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"> project</a>) and cutting a lot of employees at <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> (leading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a>) and Rare (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">axing </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a></strong>). <strong>Turn 10 Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hit hard</a>, too, essentially becoming a support studio for the <strong>Forza Horizon</strong> franchise following a few unsuccessful <strong>Forza Motorsport</strong> releases.</p>



<p>Following that round, a report from the inside <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft was 'trying their damndest' to <strong>replace human jobs with AI agents</strong>. A couple of days later, another report <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> that the layoff rounds were fundamentally needed <strong>to fund increased spending in AI infrastructure</strong>, and that seems to be the case even with the new round that might be announced soon.</p>



<p>The TipRanks report also reveals that Microsoft plans to enforce stricter office policies starting from February 23, 2026. Employees residing within 50 miles of an office will be required to work on-site for at least three days per week. Internally, some people view this new rule as a subtle way to encourage even more people to leave.</p>
