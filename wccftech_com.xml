			<p>World of Warcraft: The War Within has been out for a little while now, and the next major update will be coming soon. The <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24152008/the-war-within-1107-content-update-on-the-ptr-october-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11.0.7 update</a> will be available on the PTR as of October 31, where players will be able to get their first glimpse at the new zone named Siren Isle. With the addition of Siren Isle comes a new currency called Flame Blessed Iron, which can be used to obtain new mounts, pets, gear, and transmogs. It will even allow players to get their hands on upgrades for a ring that they stumble across called Cyrce's Circlet. That's not all, as Flame Blessed Iron is also used to spawn in an event boss, which has the opportunity for more rewards.</p>
<p><iframe title="Siren Isle Preview | World of Warcraft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbXcFW7g-o0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To give players a sneak peek into what they can expect from the upcoming zone, a new video has been released to showcase Siren Isle and explain the region in a bit more depth so players know what they can expect from the next major update for World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>In addition to the new zone coming to 11.0.7, players will get to participate in the Plunderstorm event once more. If you've ever wanted to be a swashbuckling pirate on the hunt for treasure, now is the perfect time. Keg Leg makes a return to Arathi Highlands, and you have to join the crew and fight to be the last pirate standing while making sure to grab as much loot as you can to get new and returning transmogs and mounts.</p>
<p>With this update comes more story, with players able to dive into the aftermath of the Dalaran explosion in the epilogue questline. This questline sees the Kirin Tor investigate their past mistakes and choose the path for their future. Additionally, there will be more story chapters for players to complete, where players will meet face-to-face with someone familiar in the darkness.</p>
<p>The Turbulent Timeways event will also be returning, where players will be given a chance to complete time walking dungeons from the previous expansions each week, which will provide the player with Heroic rewards and help them improve their item level, as well as get some gear to sell. Those who participate and manage to master the Timeways will be given the Timely Buzzbee Skyriding mount.</p>
<p>Finally, Humans and Kul Tiran will be given new Arathi ear customizations, which can be accessed by going to a Barber Shop, where you will be able to tweak your ear design to choose the new Arathi customizations.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-universe-turns-30-gets-anniversary-direct-on-november-13/">Warcraft 30th Anniversary</a> is 13 days away, where there will be even more announcements regarding World of Warcraft, as well as other games like Warcraft Rumble and Hearthstone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dfc-intelligence-reports-video-game-industry-gets-strong-2025-rebound/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new report by DFC Intelligence, they reported that the video game industry is projected to have a significant turnaround in 2025. DFC Intelligence is the longest-standing research and advisory firm focused exclusively on the video game industry, and their new report suggests that 2025 will be a new beginning for the industry, with a long period of significant growth ahead. The full report will be available in December, but for today, DFC revealed some of the initial significant details of their report.</p>
<p>The details include a forecasted 15% growth in the PC and console game software market over the next four years. If this is true, that will take it from $72 billion in 2024 to $83 billion in 2028. This would be a significant change for the video games industry, which has been dealing with awful circumstances for a long time now. This year alone has seen the most layoffs out of recent years in a short period of time, as well as a mass amount of studios being closed. Many people have left the industry as a result of insecure conditions, as the number of jobs available has slimmed down significantly due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-more-staff-making-it-the-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year/">layoffs</a>, company restructurings, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">company closures</a>.</p>
<p>"We've been monitoring and analyzing the video game industry since 1995, and over the past 30 years, it's grown twenty-fold," said DFC Intelligence Founder and Principal David Cole. "While the pandemic initially boosted the market tremendously, it's been trending downward since early last year, with 2024 representing a chaotic nadir that included mass layoffs, extensive closures, and acquisitions of small and mid-sized studios."</p>
<p>Not only has there been the issue of closures and layoffs, but both software and hardware sales haven't gone the way most companies expected. All of the major console brands have noticed considerable declines in their revenue, with Nintendo experiencing the biggest loss due to the lack of recent hardware updates. However, when the Nintendo Switch 2 eventually releases, they'll likely see a huge spike.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Back to the stats, 2023 saw high-end game consumers spend more on game-related hardware than on software for the first time. This includes console systems, gaming PCs, and other related accessories. DFC is expecting this to continue for the foreseeable future. This would make sense for the coming years, with the release of the PlayStation 5 Pro and the Nintendo Switch 2. At the moment, there is barely any news about upcoming consoles from Microsoft, but according to DFC, it's expected that only two upcoming systems will be successful in gaining meaningful market penetration.</p>
<p>For those who want to see the whole report, the report will be available in December, with a summary of the full report being <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/dfc-intelligence-dossier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in a newsletter</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's only a little over a week before the first (and possibly last, given Microsoft's apparent lack of plans to do another Xbox One X-type launch) console refresh of this generation, the PS5 Pro, launches globally.</p>
<p>As we approach the release date, more developers are talking about their experience with the hardware. Earlier today, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-key-feature-could-be-pssr-says-dying-light-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an excerpt from an interview in which Dying Light Franchise Director Tymon Smektala mentioned how PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution could be more important than the other hardware advancements.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can now reinforce that opinion with similar impressions from our PS5 Pro Q&amp;A with Nexon's Engine Programmer Junhwan Kim, who worked on the enhancements coming to the free-to-play looter shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-celebrates-10m-players-in-first-week-responds-to-allegations-of-copying-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Descendant</a>. Kim also believes that PSSR is the console's most impressive feature and even went as far as saying its image quality stands up to any other upscalers on the market, including NVIDIA DLSS. Interestingly, they decided to mix PSSR upscaling with AMD FSR frame generation.</p>
<p>Read the full Q&amp;A below. As a reminder, the PS5 Pro is out on November 7 for $699/£699/€799. The First Descendant, on the other hand, has recently received the second update of its first season of live service.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant│Season 1 Invasion│Second Update Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yfw3KggPuzc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>Considering that the PS5 Pro is a performance-enhanced model rather than a full-fledged successor, it has achieved significant performance improvements in many areas. As you already know, it is based on three main features: enhanced GPU performance, improved ray-tracing architecture with a new command set, and AI-driven upscaling. The most impressive aspect during the PS5 Pro adaptation process was the AI-driven upscaling technology known as PSSR. On the existing PS5 base model, the FSR Image Upscaling feature is typically used, which has some drawbacks, such as pixel ghosting and pixel jittering during the pixel reconstruction process. The PS5 Pro's Image Upscaling based on PSSR minimizes these weaknesses and delivers highly impressive results.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is less pronounced)?</strong></p>
<p>The difference between the PS4 and PS4 Pro was mainly in the enhanced CPU and GPU performance, as well as some optimization methods that enabled near-4K image output using techniques like Checkerboard rendering. I believe this created a noticeable distinction between the two. The difference between the PS5 and PS5 Pro shares a similar goal with the previous generation, but the approach this time was distinctly different and much more interesting, resulting in significantly improved outcomes. I think this is a suitable way to advance at the current generation.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game?</strong></p>
<p>For The First Descendant, we aimed to provide higher resolution and more ray-tracing features on the PS5 Pro. In terms of ray tracing, we achieved enhancements with expanded features such as ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced Lumen diffuse, ray-traced opaque, and translucency surface reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Also, how does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version support the same ray tracing effects as the PC version with the same quality?</strong></p>
<p>Providing the same quality as a high-end PC is a very challenging task. The team did their best to add as many features as possible to deliver the best possible image quality and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be different modes for the PS5 Pro version of The First Descendant?</strong></p>
<p>The original PS5 base model offered FSR upscaling and FSR frame generation features. On the PS5 Pro, we provide an option that combines PSSR with FSR frame generation, allowing for a higher-resolution, high-frame-rate experience compared to before.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to other upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we actively adopted PSSR. Each upscaling technology has its own advantages and disadvantages. PSSR delivers image quality that stands up to comparison with any other upscaling technology.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
