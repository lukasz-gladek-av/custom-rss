			<p>It might not be much longer until we actually see something new about Everwild. The upcoming project in development at Rare has been shrouded in mystery ever since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> over five years ago at the X019 special event hosted by Microsoft.</p>
<p>While the game received <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-new-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another trailer</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, Rare studio head Craig Duncan <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-gameplay-ideas-are-still-being-brainstormed-says-rare-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> at the same time that gameplay ideas were still being brainstormed. In 2021, reliable rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-rebooted-from-scratch-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the Everwild project had restarted from scratch, with an 'optimistic' 2024 release window target we now know wasn't met. Later that year, insider Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that even the people working on it still weren't quite sure what it would become.</p>
<p>The silence continued to stretch until late last year when Rare <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-fans-hopes-are-rekindled-by-new-job-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a video producer ad for Everwild. You don't hire a video producer unless the game has made it far enough in development that you can think about producing video content to share with the public. Sure enough, even insiders are starting to align, with Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-reportedly-progressing-well-at-long-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing</a> in October that the gameplay loop has finally been nailed down and development is finally progressing well.</p>
<p>Now, Rare has decided to greet its Instagram fans with an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DD_nmQTs-3a/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everwild themed Christmas card</a> this year. Needless to say, this fueled hopes that we might see this title again at some point next year, perhaps during the regular Xbox Summer Showcase. This doesn't necessarily mean it would launch next year, of course, but if even the developer is starting to tease it, a new trailer might be on the way.</p>
<p>It would certainly be nice if Rare clarified what it's going to be about. From the brief trailers we previously got, it looks as if the players will explore a vast wilderness while helping animals rather than hunting them, as in most games.</p>

			<p>For those who are excited about the release of Assetto Corsa EVO, it's been confirmed by KUNOS Simulazioni that the title will be getting an open-world map that will come in the Summer of 2025, with the game set to enter <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-set-to-release-on-steam-january-16-2025/">Early Access on Steam on January 16, 2025</a>. Those who have access to Steam and a suitable PC rig will be able to purchase the game and experience it. It's not said whether the game is planned for a release on console in the future after the Early Access period. All of this news was announced in the new keynote video released by 505 Games and KUNOS Simulazioni, which you can watch below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Everything you need to know about Assetto Corsa EVO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZlW9vYZbFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is set to get a lot of new features and content for those who love the virtual racing experience. This includes an authentic and faithful recreation of Eifel, a region in Germany that surrounds the infamous motorsports complex, NÃ¼rburgring. This open-world map is set to be released in the Summer of 2025, with the specific release date to be announced at a later date. It's been said that it'll be released in stages so that the team has the opportunity to provide continuous updates and new content to the game as it expands and nears its full release date.</p>
<p>The open-world map will also allow players to have an immersive level of interaction with other players, as well as the opportunity to interact with businesses and the option to rent cars or upgrade their vehicles via the aftermarket.</p>
<p>"Assetto Corsa EVO is primarily a love letter to the automotive world and the petrolheads' lifestyle. Our concept of 'open world' is designed to let players enjoy every single car to its fullest, whether on the rack or public roads, experiencing the pure driving pleasure and simply enjoying the ride," said Marco Massarutto.</p>
<p>When Assetto Corsa EVO releases in Early Access on Steam, it will include 20 cars to choose from, as well as five circuits across four Continents. The game is set for a full release in Fall 2025, where the game will have 100 cars by that point and 15 officially licensed circuits at a minimum, with more to come as free updates.</p>
<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is now available to be <a href="https://u15209703.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.ccgs6cDmqBRpWmPH-2B0gu81-2BxBWpoO13W1-2FJkr1waHxoUFfDV7yVfDglC2AUHrPfTy32OfPiTktnNCzdGuyzXHLgftEhrCjGAhCCDRfZYLTo-3DYUqS_wgpRUt1ukdaFRZYh9QrZG4eYzWlxCkemZe-2BsgPLtG-2FmybzPL2GfDQWiCWmTUvAuLStlYFGYu0XMbHZPcfwEvPr2K7NvGT5mlTwowLnX9JReq1NCR4DybycmQIAsy2M4nNuO4Rg-2B2rGHPCD-2BJI77VlSgCtzhW0f8QKoXVdP1d9IFabm9M2wfYUvGXScMvvEyU8ujoMJcQEbXhRJLx0AZtMVr8wl1Iiihjtm4i3sdFKYXxWdUuKlJIdEhwwSFUHsqh9bRcqy3IAL8RCvGezk69wUzVNsvpWMYQenOSUMUFshjwKuaW9GbCRJIHmenE4gkJFzddty3MisGm-2FECbQyuUouwXsgp2SAEdUEMojmFz02RKQr3x6xodqVnACAJ7DIEVMVWIyn1LgpsOJEkqj3fVZl2Q4Z1H0WM3cXqFAlTg97hDefk0pun5nV9MJ2XkN2MH-2BCuYah-2F7PJw9D5TSecWuTrDp6P08ue4RYF68mO8GVUCvI9c8bgatnuAQenlM4tMR0bPfXdJlLJj-2Fu5TapoG89w-3D-3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted on Steam right now</a>.</p>
