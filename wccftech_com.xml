			<p>In true survival-horror fashion, Cronos: The New Dawn features a few items that The Travel has to acquire to complete the mission. These items like keys and keycards, are discarded automatically once they no longer useful. There's only one exception to this rule: the Bolt Cutter.</p>



<p>Much like the keys above, the <strong>Bolt Cutter</strong> is an item that is required to proceed toward one of the early game's main objectives, but once it is used to open a door locked with a chain, it isn't discarded like every other progression-related item. As inventory space in Cronos: The New Dawn is limited, bringing an item that may not look particularly useful during the moment-to-moment gameplay doesn't sound like a great idea, so <strong>is there any reason why you should bring it with you?</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>There are plenty of good reasons to bring the Bolt Cutter with you in Cronos: The New Dawn</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though some may prefer to carry more useful items as they make their way through New Dawn, <strong>bringing the Bolt Cutter with you may still be a good idea</strong>. Even though there aren't a lot of doors that require the item to open, there's at least one of them in all of the game's main locations, and inside these doors, you will find <strong>a ton of useful resources</strong> that can really make a difference in an experience where resources like ammo and crafting materials are scarce. As such, consider <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">expanding your Shell's inventory slots</a></strong> as much as possible in the early game, not only to always have the Bolt Cutter with you, but also to be able to carry all the items you can find inside the rooms you can access with it.</p>



<p>However, if a bit of backtracking doesn't scare you, you always have the option to leave the Bolt Cutter inside your storage crate and backtrack to retrieve it whenever you find a locked door. Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't make stage navigation too simple without a map, but after spending a few minutes inside any of the game's main locations, you should have decent knowledge of their layouts, making backtracking a little easier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PRAGMATA was among the most interesting titles shown at Gamescom 2025, as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francesco De Meo's preview</a> published earlier today:</p>



<p><em>Before Hugh can damage any enemy using any weapon, Dana will first have to hack them to lower their defenses. Hacking is done via some puzzle grids that are generally easy to complete, but that can be a challenge to clear with the attention divided between the minigame and avoiding damage. Once the puzzle has been completed, the enemy will be left defenseless for a short while, allowing Hugh to dispose of it. The hacking minigames promise to become more complex as Hugh discovers new abilities, as it is possible to apply debuffs via some slightly more complex puzzle grids. At the beginning of the demo, handling the two core elements of the combat system felt a little forced, but before long, I was hacking and taking down enemies with ease, all the while having extreme fun.</em></p>



<p>I also played a bit of the Gamescom 2025 demo and came away equally impressed and looking forward to the release next year. However, just in case you're among the die-hard Mega Man fans who have been speculating that PRAGMATA could somehow be connected to CAPCOM's Mega Man franchise, game producer Naoto Oyama has officially killed your dreams in a statement <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-settles-it-no-pragmata-isnt-a-secret-mega-man-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to VideoGamesChronicle</a>:</p>



<p><em>Pragmata is not a Mega Man game. It is a completely new game from Capcom. I was actually one of the producers on the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection as well, so I’m happy to see that people who love Mega Man are passionate about Pragmata too. From my standpoint, it’s nice to see people are being so positive about it.</em></p>



<p>It always seemed a bit of a stretch to me, but as Oyama said, ultimately it doesn't matter much as long as Mega Man fans can enjoy it all the same. The single player action/adventure game will be released at some point next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X after several delays (PRAGMATA was originally slated for 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>, and then again indefinitely until the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 window</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM's sci-fi game PRAGMATA has been a mystery for a good while. In the months following its announcement in <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/">2020</a> and its eventual delay from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/">2022 release window</a>, very little was said about the game, making players feel it would follow in the footsteps of the ill-fated <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-down-hasnt-been-completely-given-up-on-by-capcom-says-ono/">Deep Down</a>, an action role-playing game by the Japanese publisher that never saw the light of day. Thankfully, that was not to be the case, as a trailer shared in 2023 confirmed it was a real game with some rather unique gameplay mechanics, which were further defined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">subsequent showings</a>. While opinion is divided between action game fans regarding the game's unique combination of action and puzzle game elements, I feel that once PRAGMATA is in their hands sometime next year, the general consensus will be generally positive, expecially if the game's quality will be on the same level as that of the Gamescom 2025 demo.</p>



<p>The PRAGMATA Gamescom demo takes place aboard a deserted lunar research facility deep in space, where protagonist Hugh and the android Dana work together to uncover what happened to it and eventually return to Earth safely. On the surface, the game doesn't feel much different from a lot of other third-person action-adventure games, as Hugh has to navigate an intricate enough facility and complete a few simple puzzles, mostly of the navigational kind, while fighting enemies here and there. To be fair, everything feels pleasing enough to play, but the game definitely wouldn't have been very remarkable without its unique combat system combining action and puzzle game elements, which is sure to become the defining highlight of the entire experience.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>PRAGMATA's hacking mechanics add a new dimension to traditional third-person action combat that makes the game extremely fun to play.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before Hugh can damage any enemy using any weapon, Dana will first have to hack them to lower their defenses. Hacking is done via some puzzle grids that are generally easy to complete, but that can be a challenge to clear with the attention divided between the minigame and avoiding damage. Once the puzzle has been completed, the enemy will be left defenseless for a short while, allowing Hugh to dispose of it. The hacking minigames promise to become more complex as Hugh discovers new abilities, as it is possible to apply debuffs via some slightly more complex puzzle grids. At the beginning of the demo, handling the two core elements of the combat system felt a little forced, but before long, I was hacking and taking down enemies with ease, all the while having extreme fun. The boss fight possibly even did a better job showcasing just how nicely this gameplay setup works, making for an intense battle that felt extremely dynamic with the constant switching between hacking and action gameplay, and properly taking advantage of the enemy's vulnerable state to maximize damage.</p>



<p>Having had so much fun with the demo, my time with PRAGMATA flew by way too quickly, leaving me hungering for more. With hints of things to come already noticeable from the demo, I really cannot wait to see how creative the development team got with an experience that is set to be among the most fun in action-adventure games in years. Sadly, we still don't know when we will be able to embark on this journey together with Hugh and Dana, as PRAGMATA is slated for a generic 2026 release window on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. What we do know, however, is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is not a 'secret Mega Man game'</a> after all.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-%E2%80%93-how-to-defeat-armored-tier-3-orphans.1288458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn features a lot of powerful Orphan enemies to defeat, but for the vast majority of them, accurate headshots with any weapon are more than enough to take them down with relative ease. This is not the case for the most powerful Orphans and those who manage to consume multiple bodies, which are easily recognizable by a peculiar trait: <strong>most of their body is covered in tentacles</strong>, making them look as if they are wearing a suit of armor. Besides making them look markedly different from any other Orphan, <strong>this sort of armor made of tentacles makes them more difficult to take down</strong>. If you try shooting at any part covered in tentacles, you will notice that your shots will <strong>bounce off.</strong> As such, you will have either have to <strong>deal with the tentacle armor first, or completely change your combat approach.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shooting canisters to set enemies on fire and weaken them is one of the core gameplay mechanics in Cronos: The New Dawn.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lowering the extreme defenses these Cronos: The New Dawn enemies have is not too difficult, if you have the right resources or if you are in the right place, as <strong>setting them on fire will leave them defenseless for a short while</strong>. To do so, you will either have to use the flamethrower, a Pyre bomb, or shoot canisters and the like if any are nearby. If you are in a bind, this is also the easiest way to deal with these armored enemies, as you won't need to do any accurate shooting to damage them once you set them on fire.</p>



<p>If you have no means to set these armored Orphans on fire, you can still take them down with a bit of effort. Although the tentacle armor seems impenetrable,<strong> it always leaves some parts of their bodies exposed</strong>, usually one of their arms, so if you focus your shots on these parts, you can take them down without setting them on fire. As these enemies have a lot of health, you'd better use a weapon with high firepower like any shotgun, otherwise you risk prolonging the fight too much and wasting precious ammo for the handgun, which you should save for weaker enemies.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-on-xbox-sells-a-lot-more-than-gears-of-war-reloaded-on-playstation.1288389/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft and Sony performed a rather unusual (especially on Sony's side) shooter game exclusive exchange on August 26, when Helldivers 2 launched on Xbox Series S and X and Gears of War Reloaded brought the series to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Whereas the latter game is certainly not the only Xbox title available on Sony's console following the policy switch to full-on multiplatform, Helldivers 2 is a unicum that is unlikely to be repeated any time soon. There was a lot of demand for it, though, what with the Xbox crowd always having been shooter-friendly, and the fact that a live service always benefits from being on as many platforms as possible.</p>



<p>Now that it's been a little over a week since these launches, game analyst (and Wccftech friend) Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how each release has performed so far. Unsurprisingly, Helldivers 2 turned out to be a lot more popular on Xbox than Gears of War Reloaded on PlayStation 5. According to the data gathered by the analytics firm, the remaster of the first title in the Gears of War series only sold around 259K units on PS5, whereas Arrowhead's hectic sci-fi cooperative game about squashing alien bugs is already nearing the million with 926K units. Helldivers 2 even outsold itself on PlayStation 5: back when it launched on Sony's console, the game sold around 633K units in the first six days. </p>



<p>As for Gears of War Reloaded, we know the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has surpassed one million players</a>. Alinea Analytics says it has reached 1.3 million at this point, but a million of those were from Xbox, despite those users knowing the game all too well. Most of those players likely accessed it from Game Pass, too. The PC userbase is really minuscule: around 41K players, per this data.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gears of War Reloaded also performed poorly compared to Forza Horizon 5, which sold nearly six times as many copies on PS5 in the same timeframe. Granted, perhaps it is not entirely fair to compare a remaster of a 19-year-old game to two much more recent games that are still among the hottest titles of the respective genres. </p>



<p>Alinea Analytics also shared more highlights from August 2025's hottest games. Peak remained the most downloaded with 4 million downloads, but Delta Force was close behind it with 3.7 million downloads, owing to the recent console launch and a resurgence on Steam as well. Grounded 2 secured the third place with 2.2 million downloads. </p>



<p>When it comes to premium games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has sold over 1.2 million units at this point, half of which on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is at 500K units, though it's still early days given that it debuted exactly a week ago.</p>
