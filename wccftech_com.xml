			<p>Today, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a major new sales milestone reached by its Nintendo Switch console, which has surpassed 150 million units sold. To be precise, the Japanese company said 150.86 million units of the hybrid handheld/home console had been sold as of 31 December 2024. Total software sales are now 1.359 billion units.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, the Nintendo Switch sold 4.82 million hardware units and 53.7 million software units, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> selling 3.91 million units and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> selling 6.17 million units. Nintendo admitted that the overall performance was below expectations and lowered its full fiscal year forecast as a result:</p>
<p><em>Although Nintendo Switch hardware and software sales through the third quarter were below expectations, Nintendo Switch continues to be enjoyed by many people. Going forward, we will continue to release new offerings so even more consumers keep playing Nintendo Switch. Looking at software, we released Donkey Kong Country Returns HD in January and plan to follow up with the release of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition in March. Other software publishers also have plans to release a wide variety of titles, and we will strive to invigorate the platform by continually introducing new titles in addition to the existing titles.</em></p>
<p><em>We have revised the financial forecast originally published on November 5, 2024, in consideration of the sales trend through the nine months ended December 31, 2024, prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year, as well as a reevaluation of the assumed exchange rate. We have also modified our Nintendo Switch hardware and software unit sales forecast for the fiscal year.</em></p>
<p>Considering that Nintendo is about to unveil the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch 2</a> with the dedicated Direct scheduled for April 2, it's not hard to imagine the original Switch's sales performance continuing to trend downward. Still, the 150 million hardware unit milestone is huge, and it means the Switch is only four million units away from Nintendo's best-selling console, the DS. The best-selling console of all time, Sony's PlayStation 2, is still further away with over 160 million units sold.</p>

			<p>According to a new rumor, Valve might be making a new Steam console. The info was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f3D79aoro8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relayed</a> by renowned Spanish leaker extas1s, although it <a href="https://x.com/HandleDeck/status/1886501899832021224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originates</a> from the owner of HandleDeck.com, who found out that Valve is working on drivers for the upcoming RDNA4-based <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-officially-launch-march-radeon-rx-9070-xt-9070-first-rdna-4-cards-for-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards</a> due next month. Here's the translated excerpt from the YouTube video:</p>
<p><em>It turns out that Valve is openly working on drivers for the AMD 9070 graphics cards. These cards are currently designed just for desktop devices. These AMD 9070s are the first to feature RDNA 4 technology and FSR 4. So yeah, that’s the scoop! This RDNA 4 architecture is currently designed only for desktops. It’s expected that, many years down the line, it might make its way to portable devices, but right now, it’s strictly desktop. Valve is already working on it; in fact, from what my friend has heard, Valve is putting a lot of effort into the drivers for these RX 9070 GPUs with RDNA 4. And the question he raises in his tweet, which we all might be wondering, is why Valve is so interested in collaborating on this.</em></p>
<p><em>This specific kind of graphics card and this particular AMD architecture, especially knowing that most of the graphics used on Steam are from NVIDIA, raises an interesting point. One of the main reasons this might be happening—and here’s the juicy part, especially after the recent Xbox news—is that Valve, the company behind Steam, is internally working on desktop consoles that will be branded with the SteamOS license. It looks like Valve might be considering AMD's 9070 graphics card as the main core for their desktop console. The codename for Valve's Steam console is currently Fremont, but we don't know what it's actually going to be called. It's also possible that they could use this graphics card to create some sort of external GPU for the Steam Deck 2, or it might just be for third parties to build their own stuff.</em></p>
<p>As the leaker mentioned in the last sentence, there are other possible reasons for Valve to be crafting drivers for the upcoming RDNA 4 GPU. However, the possibility of a new Steam console is enticing indeed. It's been nearly ten years since Valve's failed attempt with the Steam Machine, which was meant to deliver a PC-like experience to the living room. That was their first hardware product, and they've clearly learned a lot from it, as shown by subsequent and much more successful hardware releases like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-valve-index-vr-kit-priced-e1079-out-on-june-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valve Index</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, if Valve was really going to use the Radeon 9070 for this hardware, the console would be very expensive, which makes us doubt this part of the rumor. Regardless of these specifics, would you like to see another attempt at a Steam console from Valve? Let us know below.</p>
