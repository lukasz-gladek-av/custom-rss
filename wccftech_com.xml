			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a> showcased 16 games and announcements, one of them being a new trailer for IO Interactive's upcoming James Bond game, 007 First Light. Though it wasn't a huge new showcase of gameplay, a deep dive into the game's mechanics, or even a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, it did highlight a key element of any James Bond video game: the car that Bond drives.</p>



<p>The short, fifty-second trailer shows off Bond's Aston Martin Valhalla, a stunning car even without all of the special agent gadgetry that Q details in his narration of the trailer.</p>



<p>"<em>Inspired by the groundbreaking Aston Martin Valkyrie and infused with advanced Formula 1 technologies, the Valhalla showcases aerodynamic mastery, race-derived engineering, and exquisite craftsmanship</em>," writes IO Interactive senior global communications manager, Yann Roskell,<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/007-first-light-xbox-partner-preview/"> in an Xbox Wire post</a>. "<em>Limited to just 999 units worldwide, this supercar sets the standard for automotive innovation, showcasing unparalleled speed and precision.</em>"</p>

<p>Okay, perhaps it would have been better to get a deeper look at gameplay or some more insight into how the game was made, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">similar to what we saw in September</a> during a State of Play presentation. But a James Bond game will live and die by how well it truly captures the allure of the character that has captivated fans for decades.</p>



<p>Bond's taste for gadgets, clothes, and of course, cars, are all mixed in with that allure, so it makes sense that IO Interactive would put something like this together to further display how it is trying to capture the essence of James Bond.</p>



<p>That said, hopefully we don't have to go too long before getting a more detailed dive into what we can expect from the game ahead of its release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27, 2026.</p>
