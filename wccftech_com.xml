			<p>Amidst several announcements of new handhelds powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Ryzen Z2 processor</a>, Microsoft also talked about its upcoming highly anticipated Xbox handheld at CES 2025.</p>
<p>The Verge was able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discuss the subject with Jason Ronald</a>, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem at Microsoft. Ronald, who previously led the development of the Xbox One X and Xbox Series S|X console launches, promised that the Xbox handheld would offer users the best of console and PC put together.</p>
<p><em>We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space.</em></p>
<p><em>I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console. What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience. Our goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience and not all the Windows work that you have to do today.</em></p>
<p>The launch of the Xbox handheld isn't quite imminent, but Ronald teased that Microsoft would share a lot more later this year.</p>
<p>There have been rumors about Microsoft's handheld projects for years. Head of gaming Phil Spencer finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed it</a> with his recent comments but also said the handheld is still 'a few years' out. Putting two and two together, it sounds like late 2026 could be a likely release window. The new Xbox home console is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to debut in late 2026</a>.</p>

			<p>At CES 2025, we learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> PC handheld will be the first officially licensed SteamOS-powered device not manufactured by Valve. There has been much speculation about whether and when SteamOS would officially move beyond the Steam Deck, and it's finally happening.</p>
<p>Valve itself&nbsp;<span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the subject in</span> a blog post, explaining that this will be the exact same version of SteamOS available on their own Steam Deck. A team is working to ensure everything will work just as well when the device ships. Moreover, Valve said that this work to support the Lenovo Legion Go S will also improve compatibility with other handhelds. Before this handheld ships on the market, Valve plans to ship a beta version of SteamOS that will improve the experience on other handhelds for users to download and test for themselves. The work will continue after the device's launch, too, as you would expect from Valve.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems like the Lenovo Legion Go S will have two variants, one without SteamOS and one with Valve's operating system. The former will be available later this month with the regular Windows, priced at $729.99 initially, although a configuration priced at $599.99 is expected to be available in May. That's also when the SteamOS version of the handheld is due to launch at an even cheaper of $499.99.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S Windows Variant</figcaption></figure>
<p>The $729.99 version is the one equipped with the AMD RDNA 3-based Ryzen Z1 Extreme, which likely explains the higher price. The other two versions, either Windows or SteamOS, will feature the Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor, based on the old RDNA 2 GPU architecture. The price difference between Windows and SteamOS is likely due to licensing fees.</p>
<p>Other than that, the specifications should be the same: 8” WUXGA 16:10 120Hz PureSight touch display with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, up to 32GB of 7500Mhz LPDDR5X RAM, 3-cell 55.5Whr battery, two USB 4 ports, a microSD card reader, and WiFi6e support.</p>

			<p>Games available on the Xbox Game Pass can expect to lose around 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, although being available as part of the subscription can be beneficial for some of them.</p>
<p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session hosted on the <a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/news-publisher/industry-q-a-christopher-dring-answers-your-questions.37/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Install Base forums</a>, former head of GamesIndustry.biz Chris Dring revealed some interesting tidbits on sales of games available on Xbox Game Pass, saying that any game can expect to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, less if it is a big mainstream release. How low Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and even Starfield have charted makes it clear how Game Pass hurt the sales of these games on Xbox consoles. Being available on Xbox Game Pass, however, can also be beneficial for multiplatform games, as a surge of players on Xbox can have a strong impact on sales on PlayStation.</p>
<p>While a game being available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library can lead to lost sales, it can also make it easier for developers to get people to try out their game. Chris Dring highlighted that, from data, it is known that a lot of people only play the Call of Duty series, and if some of them got the game via the Xbox Game Pass this year, they might have tried another game available on the subscription service they may otherwise never have played. Unfortunately, this may be a best-case scenario, as the limited growth of subscription services and the existence of big free games that are hundreds of hours long makes it unlikely.</p>
<p>While Microsoft never made it clear, it's evident from the company's marketing messaging and some of its latest decisions, such as the first major changes introduced to the service <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">last year </a>since its launch, that the Xbox Game Pass is impacting their console business. According to well-known analyst Mat Piscatella, the company's approach to its subscription service needs to be balanced with its other services, and the aforementioned changes introduced last year suggest that this is what Microsoft is attempting to do. Balancing the service and further expanding on other systems, according to the analyst, could make Xbox's future <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-reckons-xbox-has-a-bright-future-according-to-sales-data/">bright.</a></p>

			<p>While Nintendo seems content to wait some more before announcing the Nintendo Switch 2, accessories manufacturers aren't pleased about the system still being kept under wraps, and some have started revealing more about the highly anticipated console.</p>
<p>Accessories manufacturer Genki is showcasing its Nintendo Switch 2 accessories lineup at CES 2025, and reputable French publication <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Numerama</a> had the chance to check out a mock-up of the system reportedly based on a real system the manufacturer owns and how the new magnetic Joy-Con controllers work. The new mock-up also confirms a bigger size over the original console and a second USB-C port on the top of the console.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="fr">VIDEO — La Nintendo Switch 2 en avant-première au <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a>.</p>
<p>L'accessoiriste Genki indique posséder la vraie console et expose une maquette 3D + des accessoires.</p>
<p>Les détails ici : <a href="https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1">https://t.co/5LDlnR2zC1</a> <a href="https://t.co/IJ6taQggIQ">pic.twitter.com/IJ6taQggIQ</a></p>
<p>— Numerama (@Numerama) <a href="https://twitter.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Following the report from Numerama, Genki decided to go all-in with the early Nintendo Switch 2 reveal by adding a short video on its <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/pages/ns2_accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> showcasing the full unit and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-dock-60w-charger/">dock</a>. While there's no way to verify if everything is indeed based on the real system or on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">other mock-ups</a>, there's a solid chance the video is showing the real console, given how pretty much everything about it is leaking online.</p>
<p>Genki isn't the only Nintendo Switch 2 accessories manufacturer showing its upcoming products during CES 2025, and Numerama spoke with some of them, who all seem to agree that the system will launch in April. According to some of these manufacturers, it is possible to even purchase the console already on the black market, which, as Numerama highlights, sounds like a bold claim considering nothing has leaked regarding software.</p>
<p>With new leaks and rumors sprouting like mushrooms almost daily, the only thing that is left is for Nintendo to finally announce the Nintendo Switch 2. When the reveal will happen not even these chatty manufacturers know, but with all these daily leaks, it shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>
