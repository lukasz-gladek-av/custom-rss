			<p>Polish developer People Can Fly has announced the cancellation of two projects: Project Gemini and Project Bifrost.</p>
<p>People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1929140540697727466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relayed</a> the news earlier today on X:</p>
<p><em>Today, we made a very difficult decision to suspend the development of Project Gemini and Project Bifrost - the relevant current reports have been released to the market. The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project.</em></p>
<p><em>Project Bifrost was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project. As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most. We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone's contribution up to this point.</em></p>
<p>Project Gemini was being developed for publisher Square Enix and already <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-removes-30-developers-from-unannounced-square-enix-game-project-gemini-to-shrink-scope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered</a> from a shrunken scope and the layoff of 30 developers in early 2024. People Can Fly had previously worked with Square Enix on Outriders. As for Project Bifrost, it was slated to be the last Virtual Reality game made by the studio, as they recognized that there wasn't enough of a market for VR yet.</p>
<p>A bit over a year ago, People Can Fly had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-cancels-project-dagger-action-adventure-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Project Dagger, a new IP in the action/adventure genre that would have been published by Take-Two. Even with all these failed projects, the Polish team is still working <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Gears of War: E-Day for Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-reaches-agreement-to-develop-a-new-game-based-on-sonys-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another unknown game based on a Sony IP.</a></p>
