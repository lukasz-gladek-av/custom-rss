			<p>British developer <strong>Playground Games</strong> will be the absolute star of the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong>, with the first in-depth look at the long-awaited <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and the proper reveal of <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, a sequel to a massively successful game that is estimated to have been played by over 50 million users. Sure, there's also Game Freak's Beast of Reincarnation and even a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-features-secret-fourth-game-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 'secret' fourth game</a>, but those two games are going to be the centerpiece of the showcase due to air on <strong>January 22</strong>.</p>



<p>Officially, both Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are only announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S|X</strong>. However, given <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s multiplatform policy, they are almost certainly coming to other platforms, starting with <strong>Sony's PlayStation 5</strong> console. Forza Horizon 5 launched in April 2025 on PS5 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed extremely well there</a>, after all, which is why some users were surprised when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got announced only for Microsoft's traditional platforms</a> a few months ago.</p>



<p>A few hours ago, speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jph13-tKWcY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the latest episode (#154) of the VGC podcast</a>, Andy Robinson shared why that might be the case. According to his sources at Playground, Forza Horizon 6 simply wasn't ready to launch on PS5 right away, but Fable very well might. </p>



<p><em>Fable's day and date. That's what I've been told. Those are the sort of details where insiders misstep, right? Those are the sorts of details that can be changed a week before or a day before. The other stuff is kind of like a bit more set in stone. Yes, it's coming to PlayStation 5. I'd expect it to be day and date because I know they've been targeting PS5 for a while. </em></p>



<p><em>[as for] Forza Horizon 6, I mean, I don't know the full story of Forza, but the explanation I was told by someone who was there was, like, it just wasn't ready. I don't know how true that is, because I mean, it's going to be absolutely massive, but that game would be absolutely massive if it's launching on everything day one, right? You'd kind of think that's a bit of a hindrance for them. I mean, even Xbox stalwarts are starting to drift away from playing on the console now. It'll have a humongous PC launch, but PS5 I mean, look at like Indiana Jones: The Great Circle. It did so well when it came out on PS5 afterwards. I imagine they'll do their best to get that out as soon as they can.</em></p>



<p>It is indeed surprising, but Playground wouldn't want to delay the launch of FH6 just to wait for the PS5 version to be ready. After all, there's now evidence that even the very late launch of FH5 resonated strongly with the PlayStation community; a few months shouldn't be a problem. On the other hand, launching Fable immediately on all major platforms should enhance the game's visibility.</p>



<p>Neither game has a specific release window yet, but that should change at the aforementioned Xbox Developer Direct 2026. Currently, though, it is believed that Playground will start off with Forza Horizon 6 somewhere in Q2, while Fable will probably debut later in the year (although likely still before GTA 6, if at all possible).</p>

			<p><strong>GameStop</strong>, the largest retailer dedicated to videogames, is reportedly <strong>shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</strong>. </p>



<p>The reports started appearing on social media and were quickly conflated into one very long list on the '<a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop Closing List'</a> blog, which reckons there are at least <strong>410 GameStop stores confirmed to be closing</strong> and another 11 reported but as of yet unconfirmed.</p>



<p>This is only the latest round of closures for the retailer headquartered in Grapevine, Texas. In the annual 10-K SEC filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000162828025014731/gme-20250201.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued in February 2025</a>, the company stated:</p>



<p><em>We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.</em></p>



<p>The employees being let go are understandably furious, especially since the latest wave of cuts occurred shortly after another SEC filing was issued this Wednesday, January 7, when GameStop <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638026000004/pressrelease-rclti.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a massive performance-based stock option for its current CEO, <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong>. Cohen, who assumed the role on September 28, 2023, is the largest individual shareholder and stands to gain up to <strong>$35 billion</strong> (yes, you read that right), albeit with a massive caveat: the company’s market capitalization would have to grow to $100 billion and the company would need to achieve $10 billion in Cumulative Performance EBITDA.</p>



<p>Considering that GameStop's current market <span>capitalization as of yesterday's closing was&nbsp;<strong>$9.51 billion</strong>, Cohen would have to somehow stage a 10-fold market capitalization</span> growth to receive his full bonus. Granted, there is a precedent: in January 2021, a short squeeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused the company's stock to </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank">surge significantly</a>, briefly reaching an</span> astounding pre-market value of <strong>$500 per share</strong> on January 28, almost thirty times the share's valuation earlier that month. Even then, though, the market cap only reached $33.7 billion, still quite far from that $100 billion threshold required by Cohen's bonus. And with the constant shift toward digital games, it's hard to imagine how the company could achieve such a high valuation. </p>



<p>There are, however, nine vesting tranches, the first of which is definitely more achievable for the executive.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Tranche</strong></td><td><strong>% of Award</strong></td><td><strong>Market Cap Hurdle</strong></td><td><strong>Cumulative Performance EBITDA Hurdle</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>10%</td><td>$20 Billion</td><td>$2.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10%</td><td>$30 Billion</td><td>$3.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>10%</td><td>$40 Billion</td><td>$4.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>10%</td><td>$50 Billion</td><td>$5.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>10%</td><td>$60 Billion</td><td>$6.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>10%</td><td>$70 Billion</td><td>$7.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>10%</td><td>$80 Billion</td><td>$8.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>15%</td><td>$90 Billion</td><td>$9.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>15%</td><td>$100 Billion</td><td>$10.0 Billion</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By the way, GameStop is also restructuring its operations in other countries. They sold their Italian operations, closed down in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria, and shared their intent to sell the Canadian branch. Now, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to RNZ</a>, they might be looking to close in New Zealand, too, although the proposal is apparently 'not final'. They currently have 38 stores there.</p>
