			<p>Marathon will not require a PlayStation network account to play on PC and Xbox Series X and S, Bungie confirmed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on the game's official Discord server, as reported by KAMI on <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1910157799314555338%7Ctwgr%5E64f43be216d92c4fc74c8f4f6bfdfce19b582d77%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FOkami13_%2Fstatus%2F1910157799314555338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, a rep for the game's development team confirmed that an account will not be required to play on platforms other than PlayStation 5. This is definitely good news, considering that multiplayer games like Helldivers 2 still require a PlayStation Network account on PC, essentially making the game unavailable in regions that are not supported by the PlayStation online service.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bungie has confirmed that Marathon will not require a PlayStation Network account on PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>Gameplay reveal this Saturday, April 12th @ 10AM PT.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Marathon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Marathon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarathontheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarathontheGame</a> <a href="https://t.co/cE0kYS830H">pic.twitter.com/cE0kYS830H</a></p>
<p>â€” KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1910157799314555338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Over a year after its official announcement, Marathon will finally be unveiled later this week, on <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-set-for-saturday-april-12/">April 12th</a>. Very little is currently known about the game other than the fact that it will be an extraction shooter featuring multiple different characters called Runners, who will all come with different abilities and some customization options. The game also promises to provide players with plenty of tools to achieve their objectives, such as weapons that alter character stats and more. Player action, additionally, is said to influence the game's persistent world, although it hasn't been specified in which ways and how it will impact the experience as a whole. Hopefully, these mechanics, alongside every other core mechanic, will get detailed in the game's grand reveal in two days.</p>
