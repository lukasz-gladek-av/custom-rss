			<p>After the massive flop that was 2024's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></strong>, the whole industry could feel that <strong>Warner Bros'</strong> games division was not in a good place. So when we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/"><strong>Monolith Productions</strong>, <strong>Player First Games,</strong> and <strong>San Diego Studio</strong> had all been shut down</a> just two months into 2025, it was upsetting, especially in the case of Monolith, but we couldn't exactly call it surprising, even if <strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-over-40-million-units-to-date-confirms-wb/">continued to sell like gangbusters</a>.</p>



<p>What followed was a major reorganization of how Warner Bros. would approach games, focusing in on four verticals: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/"><strong>Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat</strong>, and the <strong>DC Universe</strong></a>. At the time, Warner Bros chief executive officer of global streaming and games, <strong>JB Perrette</strong>, said "<em></em><em>Our company is home to some of the biggest franchises in the world, and we are optimizing our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps to delight players and fans</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/biz/news/warner-bros-discovery-david-zaslav-hbo-sale-1236673449/">Variety</a>, Perrette has reiterated that 2025 was "<em>a year of reset</em>" for the company's gaming division, adding that the games team got "<em>distracted going after too many IPs with too broad a set of studios</em>." And while we only know of two game releases from Warner Bros in 2026, the upcoming (and highly anticipated)<a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-the-game-awards-2025/"> <strong>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</strong></a> and a Game of Thrones mobile title, Perrette went on to tease that bigger things are coming in the next couple of years.</p>



<p>"<em><strong>The real fruits will start coming in '27-'28</strong></em>," Perrette said, "<em>when we <strong>return to some of our biggest franchises</strong></em>."</p>



<p>The obvious guess is that Perrette is talking about <strong>Avalanche Software's</strong> upcoming Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/">sequel,</a> which was reportedly prioritized over making a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/">'Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition' of the breakout 2023 hit</a> because Warner Bros didn't believe it to be worth the cost over just focusing on making the sequel.</p>



<p>There's also the possibility that Perrette is referring to the return of the popular DC-focused fighting game series with <strong>Injustice 3</strong>, a game that was practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/superman-green-lantern-voice-actors-seemingly-confirm-injustice-3/">confirmed to be on its way last year by two members of its voice acting cast</a>. Meanwhile, WB Montreal is reportedly working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-might-be-making-dc-comics-live-service-game/">DC-based live service game</a>, which might not be the most exciting thing for players, but for an executive like Perrette, it wouldn't be surprising for him to have that project in mind when dropping hints about what's coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>All of those titles would qualify as Warner Bros returning to its "<em>biggest franchises</em>," so we'll just have to wait and see which of the four franchises WB is focusing on in its games division ends up being first down the line.</p>



<p>But this is all assuming that the major acquisition of Warner Bros from either <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/"><strong>Netflix</strong> or <strong>Paramount Skydance</strong></a> goes through without interrupting anything. A highly unlikely scenario, to be clear, and one that could cause us to go without another big game from any of WB's studios for years. We don't even know if Netflix will want to keep the games division going, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/">based on how much value it placed on it when it looked at the total value of Warner Bros</a>.</p>



<p>If WB ends up selling to Netflix, instead of hoping for a big WB game, we may be left simply hoping that WB is still making games by 2028.</p>

			<p>Over the past few years, plenty of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">PlayStation 4</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong> exclusive games have made their way to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC</strong>, including tentpole franchises like <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-i-cant-escape-your-past/">The Last of Us</a></em></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man</a></em></strong>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Horizon</strong></a>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-mad-dad-redemption/">God of War</a></em></strong>.  </p>



<p>However, there is a chance that in the future, only <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation live service games</strong> will launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC</strong>. Noted journalist <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jason Schreier</strong> has suggested that traditional single-player experiences may remain <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">console exclusives</strong> for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Speaking on the latest episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/it/podcast/why-phil-spencer-retired-and-whats-next-for-xbox/id1507834679?i=1000751690666"><strong><em>Triple Click</em> podcast</strong></a>, the <strong>Bloomberg</strong> journalist commented on <strong>SIE’s</strong> strategy moving forward:</p>



<p><em>"I think for them, their strategy is like, live service games are coming to PC. But I think the sense I'm getting is that they're backing away from putting their exclusive console stuff like traditional single-player stuff on PC."</em></p>



<p>When host <strong>Kirk Hamilton</strong> asked if <strong>Sony</strong> could truly <em>"close that door"</em> on future titles like a hypothetical <strong><em>Ghost of Tsushima 3</em></strong>, <strong>Schreier</strong> pointed to the upcoming <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-release-date-revealed-insomniac-games-september-2026/">Marvel's Wolverine</a></em></strong>. The game is set to launch on <strong>September 15, 2026</strong>, exclusively for <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, with no <strong>PC version</strong> announced.</p>



<p><em>"I wouldn't be surprised if it never came to PC,"</em> <strong>Schreier</strong> explained. <em>"But even if it does, you have a strong idea of what that is and that you need a PlayStation to play it, at least for the indefinite future."</em></p>



<p>Stepping back from <strong>PC releases</strong> would be a significant shift for <strong>Sony</strong>, but <strong>Schreier</strong> isn't convinced the impact would be as large as some expect. <em>"I don't think it was that successful in the first place. So I don't know. It doesn't seem like it's going to be that big of a blow. It's very possible that they put that genie back in the bottle,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>While the recent <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">State of Play</strong></a> featured several <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">SIE-published</strong> titles coming to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC</strong> - including<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-requirements/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></strong></a> - these are not developed by internal <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Studios</strong>. As such, there's a good chance that it will be first-party titles like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Ghost of Yotei</a></strong></em> (which hasn't been announced for PC yet) and the upcoming <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marvel's Wolverine</em></strong> will be the ones to define this new era of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">console exclusivity</strong>. </p>
