			<p>PUBG Studios has <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en/news/9005">announced</a> that it will be ending support for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of PUBG, as it moves to only supporting the game on current-generation PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles alongside the PC version. </p>



<p>"<em>As mentioned in our 2025 roadmap, we've been preparing to transition PUBG Console to current-generation consoles,"</em> a statement on the PUBG website reads. "<em>Starting November 13, 2025, PUBG Console will be supported only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</em>."</p>



<p>The studio calls the transition "<em>necessary</em>" as part of its efforts "<em>to provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed PUBG on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years. We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together. We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years. This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console.</em>"</p>



<p>The post goes on to explain that players on PS4 and Xbox One will have their accounts preserved and secure after November 13, 2025, ready for those players when they log back in on a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S device. And thankfully, logging back in is all you'll need to do to pick up your account, with "<em>no separate transfer process required</em>."</p>



<p>PlayStation players will, however, have to download the specific, PS5-native version of PUBG to play the game, since the PS4 version will still appear as a separate app and not be playable.</p>



<p>Once the transition has been made to current-gen platforms, players on PS5 can expect to play PUBG at a base 1440p resolution and 60FPS, while PS5 Pro players will get a full 4K/60FPS experience. On Xbox Series S, both 1080p/60FPS and 1440p/30FPS will be supported, depending on the experience you want, while Xbox Series X players will enjoy a 4K/60FPS experience.</p>

			<p>Strauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of Take-Two Interactive, is once again doing his best to project confidence that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be delayed from its current release date.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC5BVh0IaOg&amp;t=269s">CNBC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a>), on the subject of Grand Theft Auto VI hitting its currently stated release date, Zelnick said, "<em>My level of conviction is very, very high, obviously.</em> <em>Rockstar does have a lot of other things going on, but this is of course the primary focus</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Prior to Grand Theft Auto VI getting delayed out of 2025 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar announcing its May 26, 2026 release date</a>, Zelnick did his best on multiple occasions to publicly express confidence in Rockstar hitting its <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-march-2025/">2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. To be fair, there was no specific release date at the time, just a month and a year, meaning that Rockstar could be a little more loose with when exactly GTA VI would arrive. And this game is such a major release that you'd think Rockstar and Take-Two wouldn't call their shot so specifically if they weren't confident they would make it.</p>



<p>But the number of times Zelnick seemed to have a "<em>very high"</em> level of conviction that GTA VI wouldn't miss its 2025 window does make comments like this that much more difficult to believe. </p>



<p>Sure, it's been over a decade since Grand Theft Auto V came out, and while it was being worked on in some capacity in that time, Rockstar has been focusing on <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-development-on-grand-theft-auto-vi-only-began-in-earnest-in-2020/">GTA VI's development "<em>in earnest</em>" since 2020</a>. Zelnick also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-to-2026-was-important-for-allowing-rockstar-to-seek-perfection-says-take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick/">previously called the delay to 2026 "<em>important</em>" </a>to ensure that Rockstar had the chance to "<em>seek perfection</em>" with this release.</p>



<p>But even Zelnick cushioned his comments to CNBC to say that he and Take-Two are trying not to "<em>pump expectations</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We try not to pump expectations. Rockstar's whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still beat them. I know that's their goal. I know it's going to be an amazing game</em>," said Zelnick.</p>



<p>We'll see how things look in six to seven months from now, when we're on the doorstep to its current May 26, 2026, release date. Hopefully by that time we'll have a clear idea if Zelnick was right to express confidence here. </p>
