			<p>Remedy Entertainment Creative Director Sam Lake was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDKF2dlK6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed by IGN</a> about the prospects of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-game-in-the-remedy-connected-universe-is-already-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, which he feels is really just getting started after Control and Alan Wake 2.</p>
<p><em>Personally, to me, games are a storytelling medium and, from that perspective, an art form.... It's been a long journey. I can look back and see logical steps through it all, but more and more, I'm looking at it from the perspective of all of these different forms of expression, mediums, and art forms, how games as a very modern medium can hold all of that in them and how in this interactive form we can use everything that has come before and give it kind of a new meaning and context. </em></p>
<p><em>We can really use all of that to create these layered worlds that the player can then go and experience and explore. I feel that we made a very decisive leap forward when it comes to that, but in no way do I feel that we would have kind of reached the end. Already in the process of creating this latest game, there were a lot of new exciting ideas that came about but were not possible to explore in the context of Alan Wake 2.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like we are just getting started, so I feel it's too early to start talking about an endgame. I love tying these things together. I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand and entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting.</em></p>
<p>Sam Lake also explained that how these games will be connected might also incite newcomers to try the other games in the universe made by Remedy.</p>
<p><em>The way we are looking at it, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own on feet, but then for our fans for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover for the ongoing universe story. Also, we feel hopeful that now that there is a universe and a catalog of games that will be expanding as we go, somebody playing their first Remedy game can then continue in the universe and check out the other games as well and dive deeper into that rabbit hole.</em></p>
<p>Lake talked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with Annapurna</a>, too, calling them the perfect partner to work on a film or TV series adaptation. The closest new Remedy project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, though, a cooperative multiplayer that likely won't put too much emphasis on storytelling for a change.</p>
