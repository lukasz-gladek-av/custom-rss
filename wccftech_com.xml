			<p><strong>Sony</strong> hosted its hour-long <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">February 2026 State of Play</a></strong> today, and while plenty of the announcements were surprises, some of them, like the new <strong>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</strong> reveal, we had a heads up on. After its Steam page was accidentally updated to include additional information, like how the game will feature <strong>20 characters at launch</strong>, it seemed like a safe bet that it would be featured during today's event.</p>



<p>Not only was it shown off, but we got another look at more gameplay with this trailer, specifically featuring the <strong>Unbreakable X-Men,</strong> with <strong>Storm, Magik, Wolverine,</strong> and <strong>Danger</strong> all joining the roster of playable fighters in Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. We also got the introduction of <strong>Episode Mode</strong>, a story-driven mode that combines Japanese manga and American-style comics to create a unique blend of storytelling.</p>



<p>And, perhaps most significantly for fighting game fans, we now have an <strong>August 6, 2026</strong>, PC and PS5 release date to look forward to.</p>



<p>It's the first team reveal for the game, and a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-arrives-on-ps5-pc-august-6/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that went live alongside the trailer digs a bit into the game's narrative, with Storm, Magik, Wolverine, and Danger being the only X-Men capable of continuing the fight as a new threat looms over Earth, after a recent battle left the rest of the squad with limited strength. </p>

<p>"<em>Viewed with suspicion and persecuted as “others,” mutants face hostility from humanity. Despite this, the reborn X-Men press on, driven by inner conflict as they strive to protect even the humans who persecute them from the looming threat.</em> <em>What decisions the team will make, and how their story will conclude, is something we hope you look forward to discovering</em>," writes producer <strong>Takeshi Yamanaka</strong>.</p>



<p>Regarding the Episode Mode, we won't be getting traditional cutscenes in different animation styles. Instead, the game's narrative will be shown "<em>as motion comics, centred around manga illustrated by celebrated artists</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, while we got to see a lot of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls here, what we didn't get any hint of is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/"><strong>FlexStrike</strong> fight stick</a> <strong>PlayStation</strong> has previously showcased alongside Marvel Tokon. It was theorized that the fight stick will arrive alongside Marvel Tokon, and its absence from today's showcase may be an indication that it won't make the August launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more information on both the FlexStrike and the rest of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls' full roster soon.</p>

			<p>With <strong>Saros</strong> getting an <strong>April 30, 2026, </strong>release date confirmation during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">The Game Awards 2025</a>,</strong> it seemed like a lock to be included during today's <strong>February 2026 State of Play</strong>, and it was. <strong>Housemarque</strong> did not disappoint, making a major show of more gameplay from Saros as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Today's trailer dug deeper into the game's systems and focused more on what Housemarque means by its "<em>come back stronger</em>" mantra for Saros' gameplay style. We got a look at how you'll upgrade your armor via the Armor Matrix with resources you gather on your runs, and how you'll choose your upgrades to suit your playstyle. </p>



<p>We also got a look at the fast travel system, which lets you travel to any biome you've already unlocked. You can try and complete everything in one go, but thankfully, you're no longer forced to, as you can head directly to the biome you left off at. Of course, <strong>Returnal</strong> players will remember that you didn't have to play through the entirety of a biome once you have defeated the boss, but this is now a more direct solution, so you can pick up where you left off.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We also got a look at how the Eclipse corrupts weapons and artifacts in the game, and how, on top of the onslaught of enemies you'll face, you'll have to push through the effects of the Eclipse to survive. It even changes certain biome properties, like making marsh water in one of the biomes come alive and burn you when it's active. Hostiles will also fire projectiles that have been corrupted by the Eclipse at you when it's active, doing even more damage than they would without it.</p>



<p>Housemarque promised to have more coming between now and launch, so if you don't feel like you've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/">your fill of Saros showcases</a>, stay tuned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Yeah, It’s a AAA John Wick Game”: Saber Interactive Reveals an Untitled John Wick, Coming to PS5]]></title>

			<p>Out of all the announcements included in today's <strong>February 2026 State of Play</strong>, the one that will potentially be the most remembered is <strong>Saber Interactive's</strong> reveal of a AAA <strong>John Wick</strong> game, featuring <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong> in the titular role, and the confirmation that the game is being made in collaboration with <strong>Chad Stahelski</strong>, director of the recent films and one of the key visonaries behind their success (who is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/">directing a Ghost of Tsushima film</a>).</p>



<p>You might recall that last month, almost right at the beginning of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/triple-a-john-wick-and-saw-games-teased-by-lionsgate/"><strong>Lionsgate </strong>teased</a> that it was working on a major John Wick game. This came years after the company confirmed that it had been fielding pitches for a game, but that was back in 2022. There was never any sign, until Lionsgate's tease, that a pitch had actually landed.</p>



<p>But Saber Interactive's clearly did, and it looks like Lionsgate has made the right choice, while Saber has also made the right decision to collaborate closely with the creators behind the films. It looks exactly like what you'd expect from a John Wick game, and hopefully there's plenty more that we've just not seen yet.</p>

<p>"<em>We are working closely with Chad Stahelski (John Wick director and franchise visionary), Keanu Reeves, and Lionsgate to produce a highly anticipated, adrenaline-fueled experience that fits into the world of John Wick</em>," writes game director <strong>Jesus Iglesias</strong> in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/john-wick-game-announced-for-ps5/">PlayStation Blog post</a>. "<em>This game takes place during a specific period within the John Wick timeline and contributes to the expansive and rich lore of the franchise.</em>"<em> </em></p>



<p>"<em>Like many of you, we are huge John Wick fans, and having the opportunity to bring one of the most captivating and successful action franchises to life on PlayStation is a rewarding experience for us.</em> <em>The story is being created in collaboration with our writers, Chad Stahelski, and Lionsgate. It is an original gameplay narrative that addresses a significant time in John Wick’s life, featuring well-known and iconic characters, as well as compelling new characters specifically created for this production</em>."</p>



<p>Iglesias goes on to say that the studio is working to incorporate signature aspects of the character that fans will expect to see, while also showcasing unique camerawork, "<em>bold and cinematic environments, and of course, the extremely distinctive gun-fu action and intense driving experiences</em>."</p>
