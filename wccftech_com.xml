<p>Foliage, hair and fine detail in general appear sharper and ultimately better than at native 4K resolution.

<p><em>"Native is definitely not worth the hit.

			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> that the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> will feature three games: <strong>Playground</strong>'s <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, and <strong>Game Freak</strong>'s new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong> intellectual property.</p>



<p>However, out of three Xbox Developer Direct presentations, on two occasions there were also secret announcements that Microsoft held off until the actual show. The very first time, in 2023, there was the reveal and shadow drop of <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>' <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was critically acclaimed</a> but still proved insufficient to prevent Microsoft from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>shutting down the studio</strong> just over a year later</a>. Thankfully, the Japanese developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was later resurrected by KRAFTON</a></strong>, which also acquired the Hi-Fi Rush IP.</p>



<p>Last year, the surprise came once again from Japan as Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">shadowdropped</a> <strong>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</strong>, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the acclaimed action game, and also announced <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to a great reception</a> in late 2025.</p>



<p>Well, according to the trustworthy insider <strong>shinobi602</strong>, there's going to be another surprise in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026. In a post <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the ResetEra board</a>, he wrote:</p>



<p><em>There's a 'secret' fourth game.</em></p>



<p>When asked by a fellow user if he was excited about it, he replied that he actually wasn't very excited about this game, but that was only due to his personal taste. At this point, it is really anyone's guess what it could be, so all bets are off.</p>



<p>Still, the three confirmed games should be enough to carry the show on their own. Forza Horizon 6 is the sure bet: if Playground keeps the upward trajectory of the previous few games, we're in for a treat, and the studio's claim that its open world rendition of Japan <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will 'blow fans' away</a></strong> definitely raised the excitement.</p>



<p>Fable is a bit more of a wild card. Playground has worked on this project for eight years, and we still know very little about it (although <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-looks-fantastic-has-the-witcher-like-combat-says-corden-character-selection-reportedly-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors have hyped the game</a> as being reminiscent of The Witcher 3 in some ways). However, the show announcement blog mentioned we'd get the first in-depth look at new 'stunning' gameplay, reportedly portraying all of the franchise's tenets: British humour, choices and consequences, drama, and chickens.</p>



<p>Then there's the third-party game, Beast of Reincarnation. It's the first non-Pokémon project of Game Freak, and thus there's a lot of hype for it, although we don't really know much except that it chronicles the journey of one man and their dog in post-apocalyptic Japan. The game, just like the other two, is due to launch this year on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 airs on<strong> January 22</strong> at <strong>10 AM Pacific / 1 PM Eastern / 6 PM UK</strong> on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch.</p>

			<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII</em></strong> often dominates the spotlight, its 1994 predecessor, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, remains the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">holy grail</strong>" for many long-term series fans. It pioneered the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">magiteck</strong>" aesthetic and delivered one of gaming’s most chilling antagonists in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kefka Palazzo</strong>. However, if a modern reimagining of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Terra’s</strong> story ever breaks ground, it won't be under the direction of the man who spent the last decade <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">rebuilding Midgar and the world of Gaia </strong></a></p>



<p>In a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a></em></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> talked about his love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>: <em>"I grew up admiring <strong>Final Fantasy VI</strong> and <strong>VII</strong> as a child, and they were the titles that inspired me to become a game creator. They are undoubtedly at the origin of my creativity,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>This love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, however, didn't translate into bringing elements of the game into the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy.<em> "Because I am working on the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> series, I believe the 'origin' for this work should be <strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong>,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said. <em>"I wanted to bring out the best of the original <strong>FFVII</strong>, so I don't recall taking many elements from <strong>FFVI</strong> for this project."</em></p>



<p>Although the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy director harbors so much love and respect for the sixth entry in the series, he <strong>wouldn't direct</strong> a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>. After being involved in the <strong>Remake trilogy</strong> series for <strong>10 years</strong>, and finally seeing the end of it, rather than "spending another enormous amount of time to do another remake project," <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> would rather <strong>support a new young creator</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Creative Vision Behind Final Fantasy VII Rebirth | Naoki Hamaguchi Exclusive Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbrBjFZabUE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi's</strong> decision not to direct a potential <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>, after having worked on the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy for over a decade, is more than understandable. While the development team has been rather creative in terms of gameplay, it was still constrained by the <strong>boundaries of the original game</strong> in some way, boundaries that would likely chafe anyone if they had to be kept in mind during creative work for over <strong>10 years</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong> would pose some massive challenges that the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> didn't. Recreating the <strong>entire cast of 14 characters</strong> for the game would be a challenging undertaking, as would expanding a story that often shifts between different characters to deliver an <strong>ensemble narrative</strong>. Still, much like the community, I would love to experience the <strong><em>World of Ruin</em></strong> open-world second half of the game with modern gameplay and visuals, which would be a <strong>monumental task</strong>, much like recreating characters and narrative.</p>



<p>No matter Naoki Hamaguchi's sentiment on a potential Final Fantasy VI Remake, we are unlikely to hear much about it until some time after the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has concluded. With the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>close to reaching a state where it can finally be shown</strong></a>, and with the original's 30th anniversary coming up next year, we are likely going to get the first glimpse at the conclusion of the trilogy, which promises to be explosive (and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">f</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"><strong>illed with air travel on the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highwind</em> airship</strong></a>).</p>
