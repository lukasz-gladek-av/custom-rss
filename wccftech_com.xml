			<p>We are mere hours away from <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, and just like in previous years, that means there are at least a couple of announcements that have been spoiled right down to the wire. This year, it's IO Interactive accidentally posted a reveal that was almost certainly planned for tonight's show, with a new trailer showcasing one key, but until now, an absent part of 007 First Light - and any major James Bond story - the villain.</p>



<p>The initial post shared by the <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI">official 007 First Light X (formerly Twitter)</a> was quickly taken down, though not before <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/#post-148736176">users on ResetEra</a> were able to capture it and share it far and wide across the internet. Which is how we now know that Bawma, the villain in the James Bond coming-of-agent story in 007 First Light, is played by none other than Lenny Kravitz.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate for IO Interactive that what would have been a pretty solid reveal was shared early accidentally, and surely some poor intern or social media manager at IO Interactive is not having the best day. That said, the early reveal doesn't take away from the fact that 007 First Light appears to be shaping up to be a classic Bond story, through-and-through.</p>



<p>All the way down to Bond being dangled over a pool of some kind of carnivorous animal that the villain keeps as pets. You don't get more Bond than that, and at this point, it seems like all the game's story might be missing is a front shot of James or his love interest (or both) slowly rising from the water after a swim in the ocean and walking onto the beach. </p>
