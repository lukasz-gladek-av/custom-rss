			<p>After <strong>Bethesda</strong> gave The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion the Unreal Engine 5 remaster treatment with <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered,</strong> according to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, both <strong>Fallout 3</strong> and <strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong> are due for the same treatment "<em>eventually</em>."</p>



<p>This isn't the first time we've had reports pointing to Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 getting some kind of remake/remaster treatment. This is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/">the second time in the span of the last few months</a> that Windows Central has claimed a remaster/remake similar to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is on its way for two of the most beloved Fallout games. </p>



<p>That said, Windows Central is not the only source for these claims. <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-fallout-3-remaster-hundreds-of-people-working-on/">Other outlets have reported</a> that these <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiple-fallout-projects-in-the-works-including-one-everyone-wants/">remasters/remakes are in development</a>, and considering the booming success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">Amazon's Fallout TV show</a>, and the commercial success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">it was one of the top 12 best-selling games on Steam by revenue in 2025</a>), it feels like it's just a matter of time before Bethesda proves the rumours and reports to be correct with an official announcement.</p>



<p>"<em>Some have been wondering if a mysterious countdown on the Fallout TV show's Amazon Prime website is hinting at a shadow drop for a new Fallout game or remaster. I'm told that is not the case</em>," Corden writes. "<em>However, we are <strong>eventually</strong> getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein</em> <em>of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, as well as Fallout New Vegas on top</em>."</p>



<p>So while there's no apparent timeline for when these remasters/remakes will be announced and released, all signs point to them happening. Hopefully, we'll have some official announcements soon.</p>
