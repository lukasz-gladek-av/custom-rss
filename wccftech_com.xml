			<p>Hitman World of Assassination has officially reached over 75 million players worldwide, which means that this game is the most successful Hitman game of all time. This new was announced today by IO Interactive, the developer and publisher behind the incredibly popular franchise. Since its launch, Hitman World of Assassination has now surpassed 75 million players worldwide. This milestone is just another checkmark for the team, as they have known the success of the game since it was first released. This title has achieved the franchise's highest Metacritic score with the release of Hitman III in 2021.</p>
<p>Compared to previous games in the franchise, Hitman World of Assassination is a bit more unique, as it allows players to be stealthy while also getting stuck into dramatic action, and allows players to come up with a multitude of ways to assassinate a target or knock them out and hide them.</p>
<p>The game has plenty of interesting characters to get to know or even assassinate, and there are tons of opportunities to carry out a contract. Hitman World of Assassination doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon, either.</p>

<p>Since the release of this game, there have been a ton of updates, adding in new live content that contains new locations, contracts, events, and even collaborations with famous people who then get to become a contract in the game. December saw a million active players, and the game continues to remain popular and played by many. 2025 will get more missions for players to run through, as new updates are released by the team hard at work.</p>
<p>Most recently, players were given the opportunity to see Jean-Claude Van Damme in Hitman World of Assassination as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-cut-ties-with-conor-mcgregor-after-court-ruling/">Elusive Target</a> Max Valliant, who is a former ICA operative and others already thought he had been eliminated years ago, but was found to be alive and dealing with secret organizations. This particular mission has been completed by 40% of the players, with a fair few getting far in the mission but struggling to take down the target thanks to his skill set.</p>
<p>One player in particular took more than seven hours to complete the mission, to make sure that they were as thorough as possible in the mission before assassinating the target. Contrasting this playthrough, the fastest player ended the mission within 21 seconds.</p>
<p>The Splitter will be available in Hitman World of Assassination until January 12, giving players the opportunity to try out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_World_of_Assassination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new mission</a> before it disappears.</p>

			<p>Today, Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf?_gl=1*o6yy2l*_gcl_au*MTI5Nzc0NTY1Ni4xNzM2NDQxODU1*_ga*ODQ5NjQ1NDM2LjE3MzY0NDE4NTU.*_ga_C4N5020N2R*MTczNjQ0MTg1NC4xLjAuMTczNjQ0MTg1NC42MC4wLjA." target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> another delay for Assassin's Creed Shadows. Originally slated to launch on November 15, 2024, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered the first delay to February 14</a> as Ubisoft attempted to avoid the same fates of Star Wars Outlaws and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Now, the game has been pushed back to March 20, once again with the goal of providing a better game at launch.</p>
<p>With the same note, the publisher revealed that it had appointed advisors to review 'transformational strategic and capital options to create the best value for stakeholders.' Translating from investor speak, they will counsel the company on the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> potential sale options. This review process will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ubisoft, stated:</p>
<p><em>We made good progress on the strategic and execution reviews initiated a few months ago and are confident that this will position Ubisoft for a stronger future. We have taken decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation. We also recently appointed leading advisors and are actively exploring various strategic and capitalistic options to unlock the full value potential of our assets. We are convinced that there are several potential paths to generate value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, we are all behind our teams’ efforts to create the most ambitious Assassin’s Creed</em><br>
<em>opus of the franchise and made the decision to provide an extra month of development to</em><br>
<em>Shadows in order to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months</em><br>
<em>that will enable us to fully deliver on the potential of the game and finish the year on a strong</em><br>
<em>note.</em></p>
<p>The importance of a successful launch for Assassin's Creed Shadows cannot be overstated. In today's report, Ubisoft also revealed that Q3 FY2024-25 net bookings will be lower than expected (at around €300 million) due to lower-than-anticipated Holiday sales, mainly for Star Wars Outlaws, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discontinuation of XDefiant</a>, planned for June.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ubisoft is continuing its cost-reduction process. The publisher now expects to exceed €200 million in reduction of its fixed cost base by FY2025-26 vs. FY2022-23 on an annualized basis. In December,&nbsp;three production studios in high-cost geographies were closed.</p>
