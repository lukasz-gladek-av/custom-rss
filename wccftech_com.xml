			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-qa-torn-banner-talks-permadeath-roguelike-and-sandbox-ish-elements/">Torn Banner Studios</a>, the developer behind Chivalry 2, has just announced that the first Early Access update for No More Room in Hell 2 has been released. This update is called Reinforcement and is currently available for players to explore. No More Room in Hell 2 is an eight-player, co-op horror shooter that just launched into early access and is already doing pretty well for itself. The Reinforcement update adds a number of quality-of-life fixes, new weapons, a new ending scenario, and additional skills for players to utilize. A montage of some of the features has been created and uploaded to the YouTube channel for No More Room in Hell so you can see what to expect from this update.</p>

<p>As with any update, the Reinforcement update will also fix a number of bugs and provide a well-needed balance across all difficulties. This will mean that the harder difficulties will be more challenging and will be a lot harsher on the player than they previously were. Additionally, the UI and UX has been improved for easier viewing and navigation, as well as allowing players to remove HUD elements should they feel the need to.</p>
<p>In this update for No More Room in Hell 2, Zombies will now have more natural reactions to damage, as well as improved hit responses to make the combat a smoother experience. As stated above, a new alternate ending scenario has been added to the game. This ending scenario is specifically for the Power Plant map and helps provide more variety for those who have a lot of experience with the game thus far.</p>
<p>The Reinforcement update also adds new weapons for players to experiment with, including the M7A1 Assault Rifle and the M1911A1 Pistol. Alongside this, players will have access to new skills to play with, as well as character generator rules.</p>
<p>On the official X account for this game, they have shared their <a href="https://x.com/nmrih/status/1848433282918322431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access Roadmap</a>, which includes some of the features that have been added or updated in today's update. They still have a ton of plans for what will come next in the game, such as the infection system. There are also concept ideas that they are toying with, including new maps, weapon attachments, and alternative game modes for players to dive into.</p>
