			<p>Graphics modder NiceGuy has just updated his<a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-and-complete-rt-shaders-get-major-updates-with-sky-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Complete RT</a> ReShade shader to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/complete-rt-1-6-118832379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 1.6</a>, claiming many improvements, such as up to three times faster performance.&nbsp;As shown in the video, running the Global Illumination mode at native resolution (100% on the slider) takes just 4ms versus the 13.5 ms of the previous Complete RT 1.5. This translates into much higher frame rates (71 FPS versus 49 FPS). Of course, this may vary depending on the game and the scene.</p>
<p>There's more, as the internal upscaler has received several updates. CompleteRT is now capable of dynamically adjusting the Global Illumination resolution with floating-point scales from 33% to 100%, and it can even automatically match the rendering resolution when using all the industry-standard upscalers from NVIDIA (DLSS), AMD (FSR), Intel XeSS, and even Epic's own Unreal Engine TSR. Additionally, this reportedly helps with performance, reduces flickering, and improves overall quality.</p>
<p>Complete RT's implementation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nvrtx-branch-has-been-updated-with-experimental-restir-gi-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> was also enhanced. NiceGuy says both performance and quality have received an upgrade, and the accuracy is now close to the ground truth image. Lastly, the new shader has better specular reflections, too, thanks to a fix for the flickering that used to appear when using low roughness values. The precision of the reflections and their performance was also improved.</p>
<p><iframe title="Complete RT 1.6 | Teaser Update: 3x faster RAY TRACING! better Upscaling &amp; ReSTIR GI, new NiceHancer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9gEk1j_j6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NiceGuy also announced a brand new shader called eLITE RT. This is meant to be a much lighter screen space ray traced GI shader that could potentially run even on low-end or handheld hardware. The modder says he spent months of research and development on this project, essentially swapping priorities compared to Complete RT. While the latter focuses on quality while still targeting solid performance, eLITE RT focuses on performance while trying to achieve good quality.</p>
<p>Both shaders are only available to his Patreon subscribers. While Complete RT is unlocked on the second tier, which costs $6 monthly, the new eLITE RT is currently only available for subscribers of the third tier, priced at $11.50 monthly. That's because it is still in beta and requires more testing and feedback; it will eventually be moved to the same tier of Complete RT once it's ready.</p>

			<p>Disney apparently wants more adaptations of the highly popular Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, as revealed by the Windows Central's Jez Corden in the newest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD58iKzc55c">Xbox Two podcast</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have done enough to impress Disney, so the studio now wants to develop more titles based on the IP. MachineGames, the developer behind the adaption, has done a great job mimicking the original Indiana Jones movies with Great Circle, which has been reflected in the title's popularity over the internet as well. Jez Corden says, "Disney picked up the phone and wants more Indiana Jones," implying that there are more adventures for the gaming incarnation of Indiana on the way.</p>
<p>The main reason Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have seen such a massive success, at least in terms of how the title turned out, is that MachineGames has a lot of experience with first-person view titles, notably the Wolfenstein series. This is why they have nailed the game in transitioning into various scenarios. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-bundles-indiana-jones-the-great-circle-with-geforce-rtx-40-gpus-full-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-support/">support for DLSS 3.5 and full path tracing</a>, the visuals are absolutely exceptional with this title.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not only this, but the title has excelled at replicating the lore of the original movie character, which has resulted in nothing but positive feedback for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">extensive review</a> of the title categorized it as "the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton," which seems to be the consensus among critics and fans alike.</p>
<p>While information around the future of the Indiana Jones series is uncertain, we can be optimistic about the franchise's development now that Disney is interested in getting a proper gaming franchise going. For now, the developers' main focus will be on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 port</a>, which is scheduled to launch next Spring, and the announced story DLC, The Order of Giants.</p>
<p>By the way, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has just been named the "Game of the Year" at the Gamescom tournament. It received 55% of the votes and dominated other big titles released in 2024, like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
