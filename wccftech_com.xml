			<p><strong>GTA 6</strong> is the game that most of the industry has to deal with, one way or another. Its arguably unprecedented (but well deserved, given that GTA 5 is the second best-selling game of all time) hype means developers and publishers of all sizes are doing everything they can to steer clear of its launch date, which, however, has already shifted twice, disrupting many plans and <a href="https://wccftech.com/possibility-of-gta-6-delay-threatens-games-industry-some-companies-are-going-to-tank-if-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening the very livelihood of certain companies</a>. It's a topic we covered often and in various nuances, including Goichi Suda's recent quip that his new game, Romeo Is a Dead Man, <a href="https://wccftech.com/winning-the-race-against-gta-6-by-not-taking-part-suda51-celebrates-romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'won the game of chicken against GTA 6'</a>.</p>



<p>What we weren't really expecting to cover is Rockstar's game attached to the flailing <strong>MMORPG</strong> genre. And yet, that's what we must do following the statement of an industry veteran. <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our fresh, exclusive interview about the state of the MMORPG among Western developers</a>, <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>, whose career credits include titles like Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Doom (2016), New World, Halo Infinite, and Gotham Knights, revealed to have heard that many of GTA 6's planned features, if confirmed, would place it on a path to evolve into an MMORPG. </p>



<p>Here's the exact response we got from Vogel when we asked him (and other two MMO vets) whether there's still an audience for a big Western-made massively multiplayer online game:</p>



<p><em>Yes, I believe a large audience is waiting for the right MMORPG to emerge. Consider the millions of players who have played and continue to play WOW, SWTOR, ESO, UO, EverQuest, Fallout 76, and others. The problem is that no publisher is willing to invest the money and take the risk at this time. My instinct tells me that the next major MMORPG will likely come from Asia and/or Europe. <strong>If what I have been hearing about GTA 6's features and gameplay is true, it could evolve into an MMORPG, as many of its planned features are typically found in MMORPGs</strong>.</em></p>



<p>Now, first of all, he's obviously referring to the online mode. While Rockstar hasn't shared any actual details about the game yet except for the setting and the identity of the protagonists, it's a fair bet that there will be a traditional, narrative-driven single player campaign and a separate online mode, just like with GTA 5.</p>



<p>Secondly, Vogel makes no mystery of the fact that he didn't actually work on the next Grand Theft Auto game, so this is second-hand information and should be treated as a rumor. Does it even make sense as an evolution of GTA Online in GTA 6, though?</p>



<p>We'd argue so. GTA 5 has already made a big step toward an online persistent world compared to GTA 4's more limited, session-based multiplayer, and its success was so massive that it overshadowed everything else at the studio, foregoing any need for story-based DLCs like GTA 4's The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, with new story beats instead deployed to GTA Online.</p>



<p>Moreover, a large hint that this might indeed be the direction Rockstar has taken is the studio's acquisition of <strong>FiveM</strong> maker Cfx.re <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in August 2023</a>. FiveM, a community-driven modification of GTA 5's base multiplayer, introduced MMORPG-like features such as dedicated servers, far higher player count per session, and the ability to roleplay as a specific role, like a paramedic, a police officer, and many more careers. FiveM became so popular that at one point, it surpassed the concurrent player count of regular GTA 5 Online multiplayer on Valve's Steam. It also significantly contributed to making GTA 5 a consistently high ranking category on streaming platforms like Twitch.</p>



<p>The continued popularity of FiveM shows that there is indeed an appetite for a more persistent, roleplay-inspired experience with larger player counts among the GTA community. Of course, it is unlikely that GTA 6's Online mode will be anything like traditional MMORPGs such as Blizzard's World of Warcraft or even ZeniMax's more recent The Elder Scrolls Online. However, it is entirely possible and even likely that it may incorporate some of their features to engage players in a more seamless, persistent, and immersive living world.</p>



<p>It may not be until well into next year before Rockstar Games shares any official details. Meanwhile, though, we'll keep our ears to the ground for more rumors and leaks about next year's most anticipated game. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-genai-more-interested-in-using-ai-in-the-control-systems-than-using-it-to-make-visuals/</link>
            <guid>1388440</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ever since <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">Larian Studios' chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, admitted that the studio is using GenAI technology in its development pipeline for Divinity</a>, the use of GenAI tech in video game development has roared back to the front of the line in the industry's discourse rolodex. Amidst the GenAI conversation Larian started, it appears that renowned creator Hideo Kojima also offered his perspective on GenAI in a recent interview.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/12/style/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2-hnk-intl-dst">In an interview with CNN</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109413/kojima-wont-use-ai-to-create-art-thinks-it-could-be-useful-for-responsive-enemy-design/index.html">TweakTown</a> (that actually went live a few days before Bloomberg's interview with Vincke), Kojima, perhaps unsurprisingly, said that he's not exactly interested in using GenAI technology to create anything visual. He doesn't dismiss it entirely, though, as he says he's more interested in how it could be used within the "<em>control systems</em>" of a game than anything else.</p>



<p>"<em>Rather than having AI create visuals or anything like that, I'm more interested in using AI in the control systems</em>," Kojima began. "<em>For example, if you have 100 players, each of them will have their own habits and tendencies, their sense of control, how they move - all of that differs from person to person.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>By having AI compensate for those differences, the gameplay can gain more depth. And in most games, the enemies don't behave very much like real humans. But by using AI, enemy behavior could change based on the player's experience, actions, and patterns. That kind of dynamic response would make much deeper gameplay possible</em>."</p>



<p>The kind of AI Hideo Kojima is discussing here, particularly with enemy behaviors, is the kind that we are more than used to seeing in video games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/alien-isolation-is-way-too-long-because-its-xenomorph-got-way-too-smart-at-the-time-it-didnt-seem-that-long/">Alien: Isolation famously has an incredibly sophisticated enemy AI system built for the Xenomorph</a>, which was a key element of its gameplay that elevates it to being a truly terrifying horror game.</p>



<p>His statement to CNN is also in line <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">with the last time he was asked about GenAI</a>, where he said he'd use it for "<em></em><em>the tedious tasks</em>" while he handled all the actual art.</p>



<p>While some studios, Larian included, are comfortable using GenAI for art and visuals as part of the process, it seems clear that Kojima would much rather have it make the systems and the nitty-gritty elements of development run smoother, so he could focus on what he loves to do, and the thing that actually makes his games iconic.</p>

			<p>Action games have been in a remarkably strong position for several years now. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">While standout surprises and new hits defined 2024</strong></a>, 2025 felt like the year when many of the genre’s most anticipated projects finally released. It was also the year when legendary franchises finally returned, and established formulas were refined to greater polish.</p>



<p>With so many great action games coming out in the past 12 months, deciding which five should be considered the best wasn't an easy task. However, our top picks have that little something that puts them above every other game, making them a must-play for all fans of the genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-8-7">Ninja Gaiden 4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">8.7</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ninja-Gaiden-4.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 is an excellent return for the series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After having been on hiatus for many years, and with Team NINJA focusing on action RPGs like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh series</strong></a>, it seemed like the Ninja Gaiden franchise was done. However, 2025 proved that this wasn't the case. One of the premier character action series is not only alive, but is also doing very, very well.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is notable not only for bringing back the franchise but for being the result of a collaboration between PlatinumGames and Team NINJA, a dream collaboration for all fans of the genre. And while some of the typical PlatinumGames gameplay mechanics may have diluted what hardcore Ryu Hayabusa fans believe is the real Ninja Gaiden, the game is undoubtedly one of the best action games of the year, and a great title to celebrate the legacy of Tomonobu Itagaki, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/"><strong>who sadly passed away this year.</strong></a></p>



<p>Kai Tatsumoto highlighted well the game's strengths and minor flaws, saying in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Some of PlatinumGames' best character action to date is muddled with a bloated first half and an otherwise uninteresting protagonist. However, as the narrative picks up, this ninja doesn't stop until long after the credits roll.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-8-5">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/">8.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The long wait for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was well worth it</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was announced so long ago</a></strong> that the many years of silence made most fans of the series lose hope that the game would ever be released. The little information that filtered through the grapevine wasn't very promising either, but the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/">eventual return of Retro Studios to the franchise</a></strong> provided that little spark of hope fans needed.</p>



<p>In 2025, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond finally launched, and it met expectations, for the most part. While the story is a little forgettable, and its conclusion a little flat, the game does well everything that makes the series what it is: great level design, engaging combat, and a fantastic atmosphere powered by some of the best visuals seen on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>In his review, Nathan Birch highlighted how these elements come together to offer a compelling experience that is just a little short of excellence: <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond ascends to higher peaks than any previous Prime entry, delivering an impressive sense of scale, breathtaking visuals, and classic Metroid level design at its most immersive and riveting, but a few missteps, including an unengaging story and flat final act, may exclude it from best-of-series conversations. </em></p>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-8-8">Ghost of Yōtei (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">8.8</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ghost-of-Yotei-Key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Ghost of Yōtei enhances the foundation of its predecessor considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei had some rather big shoes to fill this year. Despite not innovating open-world games significantly, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ghost of Tsushima delivered a very engaging experience</strong></a>, with protagonist Jin Sakai's struggles to maintain a shred of samurai honor as he battled the Mongols out of Tsushima being the absolute highlight.</p>



<p>Although the story may not be as engaging for those seeking total historical accuracy, Ghost of Yōtei has refined its predecessor's experience to deliver yet another engaging open-world experience. With improved gameplay expanding both combat and exploration, which moves away from the waymarker-filled approach of its predecessor, spectacular boss fights and striking visuals, the second entry in the series is a game worth experiencing for all fans of the series.</p>



<p>Alessio Palumbo put it well how Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to its predecessor in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-9-0">The First Berserker: Khazan (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">9.0</a>)</h2>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan made a few head turns when <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-is-a-single-player-action-rpg-based-in-the-dnf-universe/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">it was announced in 2023</strong></a> with its great-looking cel-shaded visuals and charismatic protagonist voiced by Ben Starr (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy XVI</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a>). The prospect of another soulslike in 2025 did not make many too excited about it, but the game developed by Neople surpassed all expectations.</p>



<p>More than a soulslike inspired by FromSoftware games, The First Berserker: Khazan is more akin to an action game developed by Team NINJA, sporting a web of interconnected gameplay mechanics enhanced by a deep loot system that makes the game's high-speed, high-intensity combat even more engaging.</p>



<p>Being a massive fan of Team NINJA, I couldn't help but enjoy The First Berserker: Khazan<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> </strong>a lot, as I highlighted in my review:<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> "With its excellent combat system, complementary mechanics, solid level and enemy design, and engaging story, The First Berserker: Khazan stands out as one of the best action RPGs in recent years.</em>"</p>

<p>Following Hideo Kojima's departure from KONAMI, the Metal Gear series seemed all but done. However, Naked Snake stealthed his way onto modern-day gaming hardware with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake of the beloved third entry in the series.</p>



<p>In an era where remakes usually change much of the games they are based on, with mixed results, KONAMI opted to be as faithful as possible to Hideo Kojima's creation, introducing only <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a slew of gameplay improvements that enhance the experience</strong></a> while offering players the chance to experience the game mostly as it was via the Legacy Style controls. And while something more could have been done to modernize the experience, the developer's choices proved to be the right ones.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">"KONAMI</em><em> </em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">has promised (and delivered) a faithful reproduction of Snake Eater, brought forth into a new console generation without deviating from the title it was based on,"</em> said Kai Tatsumoto in his review</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you could turn the clocks back a week from today, you'd return to a world where no one (at least publicly) was hurling vitriol and hate towards Larian Studios. Everyone was actually quite excited about what the studio had coming, since it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">just announced a new Divinity game</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, which was inarguably one of the biggest announcements of the night.</p>



<p>In the week since that reveal, things have looked quite different from Larian, <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">after an interview with Bloomberg (and several other outlets)</a> with Larian's chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, revealed that Larian Studios was using generative AI technology in its development pipeline for Divinity. That admittance was the reason players criticized and chastised Larian Studios online, and the reason behind the recent stir of discussion of generative AI use in game development.</p>



<p>Vincke has since<a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/"> responded to the backlash with a more formal statement sent to IGN and a less-formal statement posted to his account on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where he exclaimed, "<em>Holy f*** guys,</em> <em>we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI</em>."</p>



<p>Amidst the backlash, former developers who worked at Larian also stood up to comment on what the introduction of GenAI tech did for their experience working at the studio. Game writers and narrative designers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/">also stood up to call out Larian for its poor hiring practices</a>, taking the chance to voice concerns they had held for some time, but refrained from speaking out against for fear of burning future professional opportunities and/or out of respect for the writers still working at Larian.</p>



<p>On the other side, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">Warhorse Studios founder and creative director Daniel Vávra stood up to defend Larian,</a> saying, <em>"</em><em>Larian said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy sh*tstorm</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in what appears to be a final statement on the issue for 2025, Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">took to his personal X (formerly Twitter) account to speak on the matter</a> once again.</p>



<p>"<em>It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation</em>," Vincke began. "<em>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make."</em></p>



<p>"<em>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes."</em></p>

<p>Vincke goes on to say that the company will host an AMA event in the new year, giving those with concerns over Larian Studios using generative AI technology the chance to directly ask the studio whatever they want. No doubt that Vincke and he rest of the team at Larian would also hope that the AMA will be where they can explain themselves in a way that quells the vitriol we've seen towards Larian this past week.</p>



<p>For additional context, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who authored the interview with Vincke that started this whole controversy, shared the rough, unedited transcript of his conversation with Vincke. You can read it below.</p>

			<p>[<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">UPDATE - December 19, 10:23 AM</strong>] Though an official confirmation has yet to be provided, it's all but confirmed that more Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge options are being offered to publishers. According to ININ Games, two new, smaller cartridge sizes were announced this week by Nintendo, allowing the publisher to release R-Type Dimensions III on a physical cartridge in Europe.</p>



<p>The downside is that the price of the game will increase by 10€, essentially confirming that some publishers will still prefer using Game-Key Cards to keep costs down.</p>

<p>Original story follows.</p>



<p>[<strong>Original Story</strong>] The launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 earlier this year was accompanied by a radical change for retail releases with the Game-Key cards, which essentially act as a bridge between a retail and a digital release, requiring users to download the full game on their systems to play it using said cards as a sort of access license.</p>



<p>Although the community has been very vocal about their dislike about these releases for justifiable reasons, it seems like Game-Key Cards are here to stay, even with Nintendo attempting to address the issue that made many developers pick this format over a traditional cartdrige.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:porwhxzwut6vszlqjcvnmmag/post/3ma6x4jlgkk2u?ref_src=embed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendeal on Bluesky</strong></a>, the Japanese company is seemingly producing smaller-capacity Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges that would allow more developers to publish proper retail releases of their games.</p>



<p><em>"Due to chip shortages it will take time before we see widespread availability,"</em> Nintendeal added, but this won't be the only reason why it may be more time until more Switch 2 games receive traditional retail releases. <em>"Despite the smaller capacity, these cards will still be expensive due to rising cost of materials,"</em> the user continued, predicting that <em>"Game-Key Cards are not going away."</em></p>



<p>The widespread use of Game-Key Cards for Nintendo Switch 2 games' retail releases is reportedly caused by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/"><strong>physical cartridges coming with a single 64 GB option</strong></a>, which could be too expensive for games coming in smaller sizes and are simply not enough for larger games. </p>



<p>Nintendo's reported decision to produce <span>smaller-capacity cartridges is definitely a step in the right direction, but under the current circumstances, developers may continue to prefer using Game-Key cards to keep costs down and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-are-necessary-to-overcome-cartridge-limitations-ffvii-rebirth-director-says/" target="_blank"><strong>overcome some technical limitations</strong></a>, to the disappointment of every fan of physical game releases</span>.</p>
