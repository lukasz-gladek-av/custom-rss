			<p>The first character to be featured in The Witcher 4 Polaris, the highly anticipated next entry in the series by CD Projekt Red, has been revealed via an online actor's resume.</p>
<p>According to information discovered on Spotlight by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KekanKok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KekanKok</a>, British actor <a href="https://app.spotlight.com/4850-0168-8030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Lampert</a> will play a character called Branko in the next entry in the series. Interestingly enough, the role is dated 2025, indicating that voiceover recording and motion capture for the character will begin next year and that the game is still pretty far from release.</p>
<p>Last we heard, The Witcher 4 Polaris was still in the preproduction phase but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/">close to a major milestone</a> that would mark the end of this phase and the beginning of the actual production phase. No update on the project has been provided since August, but if the game's development proceeded as intended, it must have entered the actual production phase by now, as that was the plan earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 Polaris will be CD Projekt Red's first game developed using Unreal Engine 5. While this was met with skepticism from the vast majority of fans, it could actually be a great thing for the gaming industry as a whole. If there's one developer that could help Epic address the stuttering issues that continue to plague all games powered by the engine, it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>
<p>The Witcher 4 Polaris will be released on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
