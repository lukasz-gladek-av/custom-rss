			<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> will launch its eleventh <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> expansion pack, <strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">this coming <strong>March 2, 2026</strong></a>. To prepare for that expansion, the studio has pushed a <strong>pre-expansion update</strong> live, which will feature access to some of the features coming in Midnight ahead of its full release. </p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/">housing was added in an earlier update last month</a>, this update introduces a couple of additions to housing, including <strong>Endeavours</strong>, a new optional neighbourhood activity for players to engage in to unlock more décor for the homes they're building and some extra housing experience points.</p>



<p>There's also a new class specialization in the <strong>Devourer Demon Hunter</strong>, a new mid-range caster specialization that uses the power of the Void to fight the Void's own champions that threaten Azeroth. You get all the mobility of Demon Hunters while also gaining a new Annihilator hero talent tree, shared between Vengeance and Devourer Demon Hunters.</p>

<p>The update also introduces an overhaul to the Transmorgification system, letting players change appearance to gear slots instead of individual items, so you can keep your transmogs even when swapping gear. You're also now able to establish set outfits, with every player starting with two free outfits, though you can purchase additional outfit slots with gold.</p>



<p>You can even set your outfit to change based on specific scenarios now with the new '<strong>Situations</strong>' system, if you want to have specific looks for dungeon running, exploration, or just chilling at home.</p>



<p>Beyond the housing updates and the new class specialization, the pre-expansion update also adds several key UI changes, with new 'Boss Warnings' and 'Damage Meter' changes. You can see the highlighted changes in the images below.</p>

<p>There are several more changes, tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes in the pre-expansion update as Blizzard prepares for the full weight of the Midnight expansion when it arrives this coming March. There's a full, expansive list of everything in <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244455/midnight-pre-expansion-content-update-notes">a new blog post from Blizzard</a> that goes through all of the details.</p>



<p>So far, Midnight is looking like it'll be the biggest expansion in World of Warcraft's long history, a history that, for now, remains entirely PC-based, as it's one of the most popular games ever to not come to consoles. The last word on a potential console port from Blizzard was that <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/">if it was happening, the team "<em>would just say it</em>" was happening</a>. So, for now, take any rumours on an imminent console launch with a grain of salt. Once the team is working on bringing it to consoles, it'll let us know.</p>

			<p>Almost <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">seven years since its initial reveal</a>, during which time<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/"> the game was<strong> delayed</strong></a> on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">multiple occasions</a></strong> due in part to developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> deciding to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/">entirely overhaul the direction of the game</a></strong> and what kind of game it would be, <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> is finally at the finish line. Pearl Abyss has announced that its upcoming open-world, action-adventure title has <strong>gone gold</strong> ahead of its <strong>March 19, 2026</strong>, release date.</p>



<p>The March release date was revealed back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">September 2025</a></strong>, shortly after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">featured at <strong>Gamescom 2025</strong> with a playable demo</a>. But even then, it was tough to think of its March date as a lock, considering the fact that it was also featured at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/">Gamescom 2023</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a></strong>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/">a delay in between</a>.</p>



<p>That said, it's clear now that when Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/">confidently claimed in <strong>June 2025</strong> that it wouldn't announce another release date until it was ready to do so,</a> it wasn't bluffing. With the game officially going gold, the studio is finally ready to put a bow on a version of Crimson Desert that it's ready to launch and put in players' hands.</p>



<p>"<em>We&nbsp;sincerely thank&nbsp;our fans around the world for being with us on this meaningful journey</em>," the team writes in a message to players in a press release. "<em>Thanks to your support, we have reached this important milestone. We look forward to welcoming you to the continent of&nbsp;Pywel&nbsp;on March 19</em>."</p>

<p>It's exciting to know that we'll finally get a chance to see the full scale of Crimson Desert, a game that we still have plenty of questions about, even after we've seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gameplay-shows-off-boss-fight-against-mechanical-dragon/">multiple impressive gameplay showcases for</a> it over the years.</p>



<p>You can pre-order Crimson Desert for its March 19, 2026, release date now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, with the standard edition coming in at <strong>$69.99</strong> and the digital deluxe edition coming in at <strong>$79.99.</strong> There's also a <strong>$279.99</strong> collector's edition you can grab, if you're so inclined.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, German developer <strong>Keen Games</strong> has announced an update on the <strong>Enshrouded 1.0</strong> launch estimates. The independent studio is now tracking toward a <strong>Fall 2026</strong> release of the survival game, a delay from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original <strong>Spring 2026</strong> estimate</a>, although even that should not be taken as a hard date, especially following the delays that characterized the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-wake-of-the-water-update-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wake of the Water update</a>.</p>



<p>Keen also shared an updated roadmap, showing that there will be one major content update before the full launch. Version <strong>0.8</strong> is expected to drop at some point in Spring, adding bug fixes, balancing, and general improvements, as well as a key feature, <strong>Adventure Sharing</strong>, which lets players share their creations with the rest of the Enshrouded community from within the game. Version 1.0 will feature an advanced version of Adventure Sharing, equipped with traps, spawners, and logic elements. The logic system, in particular, is, to a degree, similar to what the developer created for their previous game, <strong>Portal Knights</strong>.</p>



<p>As you'd expect, the full version will also feature a lot of polished elements, including but not limited to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improved new player experience</li>



<li>Better quest progression</li>



<li>Various performance optimizations, especially for lower end PCs, and faster shader compilation</li>



<li>Several combat improvements, such as enhanced tactical depth and enemy variety, smarter enemy behavior, and improved balancing</li>



<li>New content: locations, enemies, and more</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, Enshrouded 1.0 will also bring the game to consoles, further expanding the potential audience. The game has already been a massive success for Keen Games, having surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-reaches-over-a-million-players-after-four-days-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million players in the first four days</a> on early access, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three million players a few months later</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four million players in April 2025</a>, and <strong>five million users</strong> just now.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new milestone is just one of many data points shared in the new infographics. According to Keen's logs, players have already collectively spent around <strong>20,901 years</strong> in Enshrouded, farmed <strong>1.3 billion</strong> plants and placed <strong>1.3 billion</strong> blocks of water, tamed 6 million pets, and destroyed <strong>30 million</strong> Shroud roots. However, they also drowned <strong>nearly half a million times</strong>, while over <strong>52.5 million player deaths</strong> were caused by fall damage.</p>
