			<p>After nearly a year of silence, Chinese developer Eclipse Glow Games has resurfaced during today's Xbox Partner Preview to showcase new gameplay of its upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tides of Annihilation</a>.</p>



<p>The trailer features the main character, Gwendolyn, fighting against a boss called Tyronoe the Ferryman, described as a powerful, shapeshifting witch. Gwendolyn is assisted by Sir Lamorak, a Knight of the Roundtable who wields a spear in combat. </p>



<p>Throughout Tides of Annihilation, Gwendolyn, the lone survivor of a cataclysmic 'Outworld invasion' of modern-day London, embarks on a high-stakes journey across two worlds: the devastated, fog-shrouded modern metropolis and the mythical realm of Avalon. Her goal is to save humanity and rescue her sister. As part of the journey, she'll encounter different stories and conflicts behind the Knights of the Roundtable and the evils behind this otherworldly invasion. In this mission, she's set to uncover the truth behind Sir Lamorak, whose suffering is caused by the witch Tyronoe. </p>



<p>One of the game's key unique features is the Knights System, which allows Gwendolyn to summon and command spectral Knights of the Roundtable during battles. The new footage reveals part of this system for the first time: the Dual Frontline Battle System, which lets the player control both Gwendolyn and Lamorak simultaneously, enabling them to attack Tyronoe and break down her magical barriers.</p>



<p>The boss fight against the witch also shows the Mirror Realm for the first time. The Folded Realm is a mysterious story element in Tides of Annihilation and Gwendolyn will encounter different types of<br>these otherworldly realms throughout the game. Tyronoe is among the few characters capable of traveling between the human world and the Mirror Folded Realm she creates, and can make use of powerful magic energies from this Mirror Realm.</p>

<p>As exciting as this new gameplay is, the press release does not include a release window for the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When we spoke to the development team during Gamescom 2024</a>, they mentioned a tentative 2026 goal, but it was far from assured. Anyway, the game will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and today, Eclipse Glow Games also confirmed that it will support Xbox Play Anywhere, enabling cross-buy and cross-progression across PC and Xbox.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-trio-of-upcoming-action-games-running-at-up-to-500-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Tides of Annihilation will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on PC to accelerate frame rate for GeForce RTX 50 Series owners.</p>

			<p>Counterplay Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/godfall-ultimate-edition-pc-five-realms-worth-of-content/">the studio behind Godfall</a>, which you might recall was the first game confirmed to be launching on current-gen consoles before the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S were even on shelves, has just debuted its new title, Armatus, which kicked off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event today</a>. </p>



<p>Armatus looks like another dive down third-person action for Counterplay Games, but with an entirely different tone and vibe compared to what we saw in Godfall. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">In an Xbox Wire post,</a> senior writer at Counterplay Games, Matt Cerami, describes the coming title as "<em>a product of our heart, soul, and fire-forged camaraderie; we've poured everything into this project, have harbored it through (seemingly) insurmountable challenges, and are thrilled to finally share it with the world</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Armatus is set in a dystopian Paris, where reality is a mess and different planes of existence are colliding with each other. You are summoned by the four remaining members of the Armatus, an ancient religious order that was forsaken by God, and charged with being their champion to fight their battles on their path to heaven.</p>



<p>It's all an interesting concept and visually intriguing design for the game, the question, of course, is whether Counterplay Games will be able to deliver on the combat and the game's story. We'll see how it fares as we get closer to its launch, which is currently set for some time in 2026.</p>

			<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is the latest RPG from Owlcat Games and the studio's first attempt at delivering a third-person action RPG to players. It was first announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-is-owlcats-first-stab-at-third-person-action-rpg/">back at Summer Game Fest</a>, and today, as part of the Golden Joystick Awards, a new developer diary was showcased that reveals how the studio is looking to bring the world of The Expanse and space to life with the help of a former NASA astronaut.</p>



<p>Former NASA astronaut and ISS commander Leroy Chiao collaborated with Owlcat Games to help provide a realistic understanding of living and working in space and find ways around some of those realistic setbacks that would result in clunky gameplay that Owlcat Games knew players didn't want to deal with.</p>



<p>Like being constantly tethered to the ship while working outside of it, for example. Instead of players having to constantly watch out for a long leash, magnetic boots provide a smoother look and feel for players, without completely removing the constant threat that every astronaut fears when working outside the ship: somehow detaching and floating away.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new dev diary also gave us a look at more gameplay clips for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, though much of those clips were cinematic and just followed characters around the ship. There was a small shot of some of the third-person cover shooting in space players will experience, but that's about it.</p>



<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is currently available to wishlist on PC and consoles, though there's no clear indication as to when it'll be available. Right now, it doesn't even look like it'll be out in 2026. In the meantime, though, instead of just watching the latest dev diaries over and over, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-gamescom-qa-mass-effect-suicide-mission/">Wccftech's interview with Owlcat Games at Gamescom 2025, all about the upcoming sci-fi adventure</a>.</p>
