			<p>After much <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">teasing</a>, a Stellar Blade sequel has been confirmed to be in the works.</p>



<p>As reported by Genki_JPN on X, the sequel to the popular action role-playing game originally released on PlayStation 5 last year has been confirmed to be in active development by Shift Up in a new financial report. Details on the game are scarce, but the Korean developer confirmed the second entry in their series will retain the action-packed gameplay of the original while incorporating an expanded universe and improved gameplay. In addition to developing a new entry in the series, the developer is planning to create various works related to the Stellar Blade franchise to expand the IP.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up say they are currently developing a Stellar Blade sequel that will have an expanded worldview and enhanced gameplay!</p><p>"We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the 'Stellar Blade' IP and are currently developing a sequel to 'Stellar Blade'.</p><p>This sequel will… <a href="https://t.co/zpLoYw0S5s">pic.twitter.com/zpLoYw0S5s</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1963102317886283809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Besides the possibility of a new entry in the series being discussed various times in the past, no one will likely be surprised to learn that the Stellar Blade series will continue, given the fantastic success of the game on both PlayStation 5 and PC. On Steam, in particular, the game became a smashing success right from release, selling 1 million units in three days and becoming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-fastest-selling-korean-game-steam/">fastest-selling Korean game</a> on the platform to date. Hopefully, the game will hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">other platforms</a> as well, as it is an action RPG that deserves to be enjoyed by as many players as possible.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's glowing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision, reportedly set to launch in Europe soon, will feature a rather critical change that makes the new release effectively feel like yet another price increase for the system.</p>



<p>As reported today by the ever-reliable billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">Dealabs</a>, the new CFI-2100 console model discovered back in June 2025 via certification documents filed in Japan is set to launch on September 13 in Europe for €499, the current price of the system. The new hardware revision has been created to optimize production costs, something that is reportedly being achieved by including an SSD with a smaller capacity than all the current Digital Edition models, 825 GB instead of 1 TB, a critical change for a system that cannot run physical games without an additional purchase. The new PlayStation 5 Standard Edition hardware revision, on the other hand, will retain the 1 TB SSD when it launches at a later date. The system's packaging will also feature a visible 825 GB label, so it should be easy to distinguish between the current and the next hardware revisions.</p>



<p>Although this new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision is being released to avoid another price increase, it effectively feels like one, as those purchasing the system in the future will get less than others did at the same price. This new release comes during a tumultuous time for console gaming, as both <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Microsoft</a> increased the price of their systems worldwide in the past few months, making this console generation the first one where systems were cheaper at launch, at least on paper. Hopefully, the global economic situation will improve in the future and prevent other price increases, which would be as disastrous for users as for publishers, as some of them, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">CAPCOM</a>, believe that the high price of systems is impacting the sales of games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the Little Nightmares series, Swedish development studio Tarsier Studios entered the map of survival horror fans with some rather unique experiences that managed to blend the genre's staples with some puzzle and platforming elements that made the franchise rather popular. Having had to leave the franchise behind after getting acquired by Amplifier Game Invest in late 2019, Tarsier Studios started working on Reanimal, a survival horror game featuring everything that made their survival horror series so popular, with some choice enhancements, including co-op.</p>



<p>Although Tarsier Studios isn't adding co-op as an answer to Supermassive Games doing the same in the third entry in the series the Swedish studio has created launching this year, the gameplay similarities between Reanimal and Little Nightmares 3 were uncanny, with setting and characters doing most of the differentiating work. In the Tarsier Studios' developed game, two players, or a player with an AI-controlled partner, will take on the role of an unnamed brother and sister as they traverse a hellish version of their home and attempt to save three friends. As they make their dangerous journey through this world, the two will have to cooperate to solve puzzles, which include activating different contraptions at the same time, moving objects to create platforms upon which the other can climb to reach important items or switches, and avoiding getting captured by massive enemies.</p>

<p>Beginning after getting stranded on a beach, the Reanimal Gamescom demo provided a decent look at the game and what its co-op-focused experience offered. While the puzzles were nicely designed, but not very surprising, I felt the game was at its best during a hectic escape sequence where the players had to combine stealth and platforming to escape from a nicely designed and animated giant doll-like creature.  These escaping sequences were undoubtedly the highlight of the short demo, and the most hilarious, which made it easy to look past the puzzle design, which was too familiar at times, even with the tweaks made necessary by the co-op approach of the game.</p>



<p>Familiar is possibly the best way to describe what I have seen of Reanimal during this year's Gamescom. While an around 20-min session is obviously not enough to paint a whole picture, there's no denying that Tarsier Studio's first game after the Little Nightmares series will not disappoint fans of the series looking for an experience carrying the developer's trademark style when it launches sometime next year on PC and consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft%E2%80%99s-2026-27-lineup-includes-new-ghost-recon-far-cry-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-more.1287204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned insider Tom Henderson has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> an overview of Ubisoft's 2026-27 game lineup, which includes several new installments in big franchises.</p>



<p>According to Henderson's sources, the next Ghost Recon game is reportedly called Project Ovr and may ditch the AnvilNext 2.0 engine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5. The game is also supposedly switching perspectives: the most recent games, 2017's Ghost Recon: Wildlands and 2019's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, used a third-person view with an optional first-person view only available when aiming weapons. However, most of the previous entries in the 24-year-old franchise were in first-person, and Project Ovr should return to those historical roots. </p>



<p>Ubisoft is also making two new Far Cry games, which in itself is entirely unsurprising. It's one of the publisher's most successful franchises, as evidenced by Far Cry being one of only three IPs (the others being Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed) that were deemed critical <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when establishing the new subsidiary</a>. About a year ago, job ads for a new Far Cry title were <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> online. Tom Henderson revealed that the two projects are codenamed Blackbird and Maverick, with the former being a regular sequel and the latter an extraction shooter that could be canceled before actually launching. There's also supposed to be an engine change here from the proprietary Dunia to Massive's Snowdrop.</p>



<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Hexe</a>, the next mainline Assassin's Creed game that is being spearheaded by Clint Hocking (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Far Cry 2, Watch Dogs: Legion). Unlike most of the recent entries in the IP, it won't have roleplaying elements. Its setting has already been announced to be dark and medieval, likely based around witch hunts, as suggested by the codename. Finally for the sequels, Henderson is adamant that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still happening.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is also looking to deliver on three long-awaited remakes: <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splinter Cell</a> (Project North), <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-it-is-still-deep-in-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia</a> (Project Rewind), and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (Project Obsidian). The remaining lineup for 2026-27 should include Assassin's Creed Invictus (the Fall Guys-like multiplayer spin-off) and two new IPs, an extraction shooter set in World War II (Project Crest) and a game inspired by Nintendo's Animal Crossing (Project Alterra). Beyond 2027, there will be more Assassin's Creed games, The Crew 3, and The Division 3.</p>



<p>What do you think of this lineup? Is there anything that excites you?</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Bethesda Game Studios released a Fallout 76 update that includes a major revamp of the C.A.M.P. feature, which allows players to build their own home bases within the game world.</p>



<p>The enhancements have been detailed in an official developer preview by Fallout 76 Game Director Jon Rush:</p>



<p><em>We wanted to create an update that empowers our amazing building community by making it easier to build and giving you more tools to build with. C.A.M.P. Revamp features a revised workshop menu that streamlines navigation, allowing you to build quicker than ever before. We've arranged our thousands of items into main categories and subcategories. For example, our lighting main category now has multiple subcategories, such as freestanding lights and wall-mounted lights. An equally exciting addition within C.A.M.P. Revamp is that we're getting rid of our building restrictions regarding placement, allowing you to toggle snapping, intersecting, and free place anywhere. We see and hear you, Sky Campers. These changes allow you more freedom than ever to build in Appalachia. And to really show off our wonderful community's creativity, we'll be kicking off a series of exciting monthly camp building competitions later this year with huge prizes.</em></p>

Revamp - Developer Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlz9Bqp26BU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As with any decent patch, though, C.A.M.P. Revamp doesn't actually improve just player bases in Fallout 76. For example, the Caravan event has been modified to ensure that players will get rewarded if the Brahmin is alive, even if they do not complete the route. The event now also has a maximum duration of seven minutes. </p>



<p>Item locking has been introduced as a means to prevent accidental scrapping of important items. Moreover, the developers (who have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-new-content-double-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working alongside Double Eleven</a> for several years now) have pushed a new batch of combat balancing tweaks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improving the manual aiming experience.</li>



<li>Improvements to the V.A.T.S. formula.</li>



<li>Providing significant buffs to melee and ranged weapon damage.</li>



<li>Boosts to damage-over-time effects.</li>



<li>Increases to weapon ranges.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The new season, 'Appalachian Modern Living,' is now live in Fallout 76. In other Fallout news, take a look at the first trailer for the TV show's second season, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">airs on December 17</a>.</p>
