			<p>A new game project titled Lionhearts <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/612741239/lionhearts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared on Kickstarter</a> yesterday, seeking a minimum of $100K, of which over half has already been pledged. ROBLOX fans might recognize the name from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/1160789" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts: Crusade</a>, a conquest experience developed by Credenzio Studios that reached over 6.3 million plays in the popular game since its original release in 2018.</p>
<p>Now, Colorado-based developer Credenzio is turning the concept into a standalone game developed with Unreal Engine 5. It will be a persistent multiplayer feudal simulator inspired by games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount and Blade: Bannerlord</a>, Assassin's Creed, Helldivers, and EVE Online.</p>
<p>The game is set in a historically authentic 12th-century medieval world, specifically during the Third Crusade. The developers pledged to respect the bounds of historical plausibility and accuracy. In this context, players will be given nearly complete reign, with NPCs having little to no presence in the game world. They'll start with having to gain favor in their kingdom to ascend the religious, military, or trade hierarchies and acquire wealth, tools, lands, and power. To do so, they'll choose one of the three career paths of the age: military, religious, or trade. With 16 factions, 14 guild types offering 60+ career paths, and 4 religions, players can become a knight, blacksmith, bishop, merchant, or even a king, eventually ruling the Holy Land itself.</p>

<p>In Lionhearts, there will be 12 player-run kingdoms and 4 military orders, in which every position of power, from lord to king, is controlled by real players. Players can command retinues, wage wars, and navigate diplomacy in an ever-changing struggle for land and influence. Monarchs must balance internal politics, trade, and religion while competing for dominance in the Holy Land and beyond. As mentioned earlier, Credenzio is promising a persistent MMO-like world. This is supposed to happen through a server meshing-like technology where servers are stitched together to create a single, seamless shared open world. Each location will exist in a single instance, so there will be no need for server hopping or loading screens.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it's an incredibly ambitious project, especially for an indie studio. There is, however, a 'visual demo' available for download (the link is on the Kickstarter page) for those interested. Otherwise, you could simply add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3348690/Lionhearts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts</a> to your Steam wishlist.</p>

			<p>There's no doubt that Mario Kart World is the most important launch game for the Nintendo Switch 2. Not only is it the only new game (no, the Welcome Tour definitely doesn't count) made by Nintendo for the launch lineup, it's also the sequel to one of the best-selling games ever. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, at last count, has sold nearly 70 million units on the original Switch.</p>
<p>Whether Mario Kart World can match it with similar success remains to be seen over a long period of time. Still, the early reception is promising. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game earned an 8.5 out of 10 score from Nathan Birch, who wrote:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em></p>
<p>Making the new open world-style game required a much larger workforce, though. Japanese analyst Papen (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mario-kart-world-had-a-significantly-larger-dev-team-than-past-entries-with-art-related-positions-increasing-threefold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Automaton</a>) has looked into the headcount, discovering that around 300 developers worked on Mario Kart World, compared to 163 on MK8 Deluxe. That shows how Nintendo is following the market trend in this regard, with larger and inevitably more expensive teams making bigger games.</p>
<p>The biggest increase was in the art department, which tripled in size from one game to another. Furthermore, like most of the gaming industry nowadays, Nintendo leveraged several development teams beyond Nintendo EPD, such as Monolith Soft, Bandai Namco, Imagica Geeq, and 1-Up Studio. This could go some way to explaining why Mario Kart World was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infamously priced at $80</a>.</p>
<p>Did you purchase the game alongside the Nintendo Switch 2? If so, please comment below with your impressions.</p>

			<p>A new CAPCOM Spotlight livestream has been announced this morning by the Japanese publisher. It will air on Thursday, June 26, at 3 PM Pacific Time (6 PM Eastern time, 11 PM GMT, midnight CET) on CAPCOM's YouTube channels. It's expected to last around 40 minutes, featuring news and updates on both upcoming games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-sgf-2025-hands-off-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRAGMATA</a>) and existing games (Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6).</p>
<p>The first two are those more likely to gain interest from fans. CAPCOM has shown them off during this year's Summer Game Fest, and our envoy, Kai Tatsumoto, checked both. Here are a couple of quotes from his previews:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Much of the Resident Evil Requiem demo was spent in the dark shadows and ambiance of the abandoned hotel with no shambling zombies or dogs to contend with. After a brief jump scare when opening a door, Grace gets her first encounter with an infected human, one thankfully already dead for good. It’s here that an even larger monster is introduced, a massive hunch-backed, grotesque fiend with massive teeth that gobble up the corpse. Due to its hulking size on par with Lady Dimitrescu, its running speed isn’t that fast, and Grace can escape her with relative ease, at least for a brief moment, before the monster escapes into the ceiling above. After another surprise encounter and getting a sizable chunk of her shoulder bitten off, Grace had to heal up using a med injector she found earlier, a healing tool that was first introduced as part of Chris Redfield’s kit in the last two mainline titles.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>It’s not all linear hallways and shooting gallery corridors in PRAGMATA. The player astronaut can jump and glide about briefly to reach far-off platforms, or shoot security locks and open up new elevators to help traverse the lunar station. Taking a step off the beaten path rewards the players with fresh weapons and even permanently increases the number of healing items they can carry at a given time. PRAGMATA’s demo only ran about fifteen minutes or so after getting an initial introduction to the setting and reintroduction to a game that CAPCOM has revealed and talked about only briefly since the initial reveal five years ago today. During my entire session, I kept getting these uncanny Lost Planet vibes through the gunplay and overall technology used in the construction of the world. However, I’m sure this is just a personal take on the world of PRAGMATA.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, many CAPCOM fans still play Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6. The latter game has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 5 million sales milestone. Both are likely to be supported for a few years still.</p>
<p>Which of these games are you most looking forward to for next week's CAPCOM Spotlight? Let us know below.</p>
