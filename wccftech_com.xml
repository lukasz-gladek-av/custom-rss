			<p>Eidos Montreal doesn't seem to have given up entirely on the Deus Ex series and has reportedly pitched a new entry in the series to multiple publishers, sadly to no avail.</p>
<p>On the latest episode of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Insider Gaming</a> Weekly podcast, it was revealed that, following the cancellation of a new entry in the series, which came as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/">Embracer's restructuring</a>, the development studio started pitching a new Deus Ex game completely separate from the one that Embracer canceled to multiple publishers to see who would be interested in the game. Sadly, none of the publishers that have been contacted showed an interest, and one in particular said that the series is too niche to do anything with. As Eidos Montreal pitched the game to anyone in the market who would even listen to a game pitch, we shouldn't expect this game to see the light of day anytime soon, if ever.</p>

<p>As things stand, and with publishers being more averse than ever to taking risks, as highlighted by Tom Henderson in the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast above, it looks like Deus Ex Mankind Divided will remain the final entry in the series for a very long time. You can learn more about the game released back in 2016 in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deus-mankind-divided-review-totally-asked/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Could it be better? Most certainly, as pointed out in the review. But Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is already great as it is, and you would be remiss to leave it hanging in physical (or digital) stores if you care the slightest bit about RPGs with a deep story, lots of choices and a cyberpunk setting.</em></p>

			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States won't begin on April 9th, as originally announced, to allow the company to evaluate the potential impact of tariffs in the country.</p>
<p>As reported on Bluesky by GameSpot Managing Editor Tamoor Hussain, Nintendo confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders will not begin on April 9th in order to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." The console's release date is unchanged, so it will still be released on June 5th in the United States as it will in the rest of the world. Needless to say, this is extremely concerning, as the chance of a price increase has now skyrocketed.</p>

<p lang="en">Statement from Nintendo: Statement from Nintendo: Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</p>

<p>Even with a price higher than the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">$449.99</a>, will the Nintendo Switch 2 be a worthy purchase? Probably not for some, as Nathan found the console to be maybe too pricey even for $50, despite offering a significant improvement over its predecessor in every possible way, as he highlighted in his hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>If you’re one of the sizable number of folks who have affection for their trusty Switches, it seems quite likely you’ll enjoy the Switch 2. The system looks better, feels better, the Joy-Cons are sturdier and more versatile, and playing Nintendo games with some decent hardware grunt behind them is a nice change of pace. Whether the Switch 2 reaches the commercial heights of the OG Switch will largely depend on its library of games, but titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza show Nintendo can still deliver fun, and sometimes unexpected, experiences with their long-running franchises</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launched on June 5th worldwide. We will keep you updated on the new US pre-order date and any changes in the system's price as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Arguably, the most unexpected game announcement made during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FromSoftware's The Duskbloods</a>. Today, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a lengthy interview with FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki, revealing lots of information on the upcoming game.</p>
<p>The creator of Demon Souls, Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Elden Ring revealed that the project started on the original Nintendo Switch. When Nintendo reached out about the Switch 2, FromSoftware realized it would have been better off making it for the more powerful console.</p>
<p>Miyazaki confirmed it is a PvPvE game, which is a formula that the studio considers very interesting because 'it allows for a broad range of game-design ideas while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters.' However, the revered game designer also wanted to clarify in no uncertain terms that the Japanese studio is not at all abandoning single player games, despite The Duskbloods and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imminent launch of Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which is also focused on multiplayer:</p>
<p><em>Please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</em></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</em></p>
<p>Miyazaki then proceeded to reveal a few tidbits about the setting of The Duskbloods. Players will be able to pick from over twelve playable characters, all of whom belong to a group called Bloodsworn. These Bloodsworn attained superhuman abilities by drinking special blood in a manner not unlike vampires, although the creator said they focused on the romantic side of the vampire lore instead of the monstrous side. The Bloodsworn are reportedly competing for something called 'First Blood', being summoned to the 'Twilight of Humanity' across various places and times. That's why the trailer showed very different locations.</p>
<p>Given their background, the Bloodsworn will be able to pull off more dramatic moves than in previous FromSoftware games. Also, due to the setting, each character will be equipped with some sort of ranged attack (mostly firearms), in another distinction from the studio's usual melee focus. The characters can also be customized to an extent.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Duskbloods – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niKHDEKQ7xA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In The Duskbloods, players will first join a hub area before jumping into a match where up to eight players can participate at once. Usually, the victory condition is simply 'last man standing,' but in some cases, it may be required to band together and defeat a PvE boss. The game also implements Victory Points, which are not necessarily connected to direct combat, allowing for alternative playstyles. An event system was introduced to ensure matches would feature variations, such as a special enemy or bonus side objectives.</p>
<p>Lastly, Miyazaki-san outlined a role system that is still being finished. One player could choose the Destined Rivals role so that another player in that match would be designated as their rival; finding and defeating them would be a personal goal with its own rewards. On the other hand, Destined Companion requires a player to find another player who was randomly designated as their companion, which results in a special reward if they can form a bond.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that The Duskbloods sounds very interesting. It's just unfortunate that it'll be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2, similar to Bloodborne on PlayStation 4, instead of being available on all platforms like Dark Souls or Elden Ring. The game is currently slated for a 2026 launch.</p>
