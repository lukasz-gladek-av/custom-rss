			<p>EA has narrowed the release window for Skate's early access launch, which is now due to arrive sometime in summer 2025. The company also <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-three">showcased</a> the next major update that'll be arriving for players who are already taking to the streets of San Vansterdam, which will provide a whole new look to the city compared to the one players have had in the playtest so far.</p>
<p>Update 0.27.0 arrives on July 2, 2025, and adds a great deal of detail to the city and environments that players will skate through. It also includes more than 140 new challenges for players to test their skills and new character customization features for players to really start expressing themselves in this new Skate, even in the insider playtest.</p>
<p>All of which is shown in the video below, through a few small clips of gameplay from the insider playtest, with players skating around the new San Vansterdam with the 0.27 update live.</p>

<p>If you've not yet signed up for the playtest and want to try the game before it launches in early access sometime this summer, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">make sure to sign up</a> before <strong>June 27, 2025</strong>, as registrations for the playtest will be closed after that date.</p>
<p>The before-and-after photos shared by EA, showing how the playtest will change, in environmental detail alone, are another example of just how close we're getting to the game's launch, with players finally no longer skating in mostly grey environments.</p>

<p>EA also confirmed that Skate can be wish-listed on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, so players keen on jumping into the new game can be notified when pre-orders go live.</p>
<p>We're so close to the return of the Skate series, an event that many players and fans of the original trilogy didn't think would happen. It'll be interesting to see how the full game resonates with players, and how EA and Full Circle continue to respond to player feedback as the early access period goes on, which, as of now, doesn't seem like it'll be that long, if the full game is still due out by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">April 2026</a>.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles story script will be significantly bigger than the script of the original PlayStation version in terms of characters, the game's director confirmed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://publish.twitter.com/?url=https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1935191460619718669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, director Yasumi Matsuno revealed that, in terms of characters, the Japanese script of the remaster is estimated to be around 60% bigger than the original script. Matsuno-san added that this figure does not include system-related text, chanting text, brave stories, sound novels, or cutscenes. In terms of actual text, Matsuno-san said that it is difficult to compare the total between the new and old versions, but if the increased characters are of any indication, the script has been significantly expanded over the original.</p>
<p>In terms of new content over the original PlayStation version, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles won't feature much besides additional character conversations meant to enhance the story and characters. In a new interview shared by Square Enix on its <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">official website</a>, director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed that the additional content added to the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile ports are based, won't be included, as the team wanted to recreate the original faithfully. Maehiro-san also revealed that one of the biggest challenges in developing the remaster was doing so without the original game's source code, which had been lost, which is not uncommon for older games. As such, the team analyzed various existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming, and even worked things out by feel alone by playing the game.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">September 30th.</a></p>
