			<p>The Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuVeWIoqPPk">supported</a> keyboard and mouse controls, but it wasn't always a plug-and-play situation, and only a few games specifically supported the controls. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, however, not only supports keyboard and mouse controls but seems to support them natively, meaning that for most games, it is, in fact, a plug-and-play situation if you want to use a keyboard and mouse for a game on your Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>YouTuber Blunty noticed that while playing Cyberpunk 2077 on their Nintendo Switch 2, even with mouse controls turned off in the game's settings, the console still responded to their wireless mouse, which was plugged into the Nintendo Switch 2's dock.</p>
<p>Of course, Blunty didn't stop there and took the next obvious step of plugging in a keyboard. Sure enough, it worked without a hitch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wait... Cyberpunk on Switch 2 JUST WORKS with Mouse &amp; Keyboard!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCNUKwCQ35o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with Cyberpunk 2077, we also know that Koei Tecmo's upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-couldnt-manage-4k60-in-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition/">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 supports mouse controls, because the developers showed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/674176/nintendo-switch-2-usb-mouse-support">off during a live stream last month</a>. But that was just one game, and it wasn't clear at the time if this was a feature that Koei Tecmo had to add, or if mouse controls were natively supported by the Switch 2.</p>
<p>But seeing them just work on Cyberpunk 2077 without any prior setup and by just plugging in USB dongles for a mouse and keyboard, it seems to suggest that you can plug in a mouse and keyboard for almost any game and have it work seamlessly.</p>
<p>That'll be figured out as more people get their hands on a Switch 2 and test the keyboard and mouse functionality for each game, but it seems like the work Nintendo put in to make the new JoyCons work like a mouse comes with the added benefit of being able to plug in a USB keyboard and mouse for pretty much anything, and have it work without issue.</p>

			<p>With the main <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest</a> showcase event only hours away at the time of this writing, it's no surprise that some of the announcements are beginning to leak out early, like the launch trailer for the Lies Of P DLC expansion, Overture, appearing online, spoiling the surprise that it is going to be shadow-dropped this weekend.</p>
<p>There's some debate as to when the trailer will be shown, whether it's at tonight's Summer Game Fest showcase, or during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">Xbox showcase</a> on Sunday, but based on the images and videos that have leaked on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-lies-of-p-dlc-will-be-shadowdropped-this-week.1209165/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544">X</a>, it's clear that it will be shadow-dropped, whenever the reveal does show up.</p>
<p>Even with this news leaking online, it's not the biggest surprise that Lies of P: Overture would be out this weekend. As recently as last week, it was rumored to arrive for the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and well before that, we knew it would <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/">arrive sometime this summer</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's just a matter of waiting to see where the trailer shows up. The leaked trailer only highlights Xbox platforms at the end, and begins with the Xbox logo, which makes it seem like it'll appear on Sunday. It wouldn't be the first time that the DLC has <a href="https://wccftech.com/idxbox-fanfest-reveals-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-date-lies-of-p-overture-trailer-and-more/">appeared at an Xbox show</a>.</p>
<p>If it does show up during Xbox's showcase, then it is also potentially the second announcement from Xbox's show to have leaked earlier, with rumors circulating that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-revealed-xbox/">Persona 4 Remake</a> will be officially announced on Sunday as well.</p>
