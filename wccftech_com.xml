			<p>Pearl Abyss's upcoming Crimson Desert finally has a release date after being<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/"> delayed this past August (at least publicly) for the second time</a>. Its<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/"> first major delay in 2021 was an indefinite delay </a>with no new release date in sight, and since then, we've seen it appear <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">at annual shows like Gamescom</a> with gameplay demos that did not lead to release date reveals, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">including this year's Gamescom show</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, we only got its release date reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">last week during PlayStation's State of Play event</a>, confirming that it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming March 19, 2026. Now that we have a release date though, we can look forward to its arrival and look at gameplay showcases with a more engaged eye, since we know it'll be in our hands within the next six months.</p>



<p>As part of IGN's First preview series, a new 11 minute gameplay video showcases one of the many quests you'll encounter in Crimson Desert, though for the most part it features a fairly bombastic boss fight, one of the many you'll have to face in the open-world action-adventure game.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, we've been waiting on and hearing about Pearl Abyss's upcoming open-world title for six years. It'll be seven by the time we actually have the game in our hands next March. For even more context, back when <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">Wccftech spoke to Pearl Abyss in 2019</a>, the studio said it was "<em>very positive</em>" about Google Stadia, as we were starting to learn more about Crimson Desert and where it would be playable.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we've seen the last delay Crimson Desert is going to get, and can just look forward to its launch on Mach 19, 2026. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-tracing-qa-fsr4-omm-ser-support-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest tech-focused interview with Gaijin Entertainment</a>, we asked the programmers behind the War Thunder game and the Dagor Engine whether Sony's PS5 Pro can support the new path tracing global illumination technology <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently introduced on PC with the game's Leviathan update</a>. Here's their response:</p>



<p><em><strong>László Perneky (Lead Programmer):</strong>&nbsp;Technically, it could; the only question is with performance. It is a decision for the future, though. First, we focus on releasing RT support for consoles, with all the effects except PTGI (hopefully very soon). Then, we will have a better picture of how much GPU budget we have to include PTGI and if we can make changes to it to fit that budget.</em></p>



<p>You might recall that about a year ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we asked a similar question to PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny</a>, who was very cautious about committing one way or another:</p>



<p><em>One difficulty in answering your question is that there are so many strategies for doing ray tracing or path tracing. Just to give an example, the engine that drives Alan Wake 2 is very, very different from the engine that drives Cyberpunk 2077. I really hesitate to say that PlayStation 5 Pro can or can't do path tracing, but you need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PS5 Pro.</em></p>



<p>To this day, no game has introduced path tracing support on PS5 Pro. War Thunder might be the best chance the console has to pull it off, since it is not a full-fledged path tracing but just PTGI. However, it is more likely that console users will have to wait for the PS6 to get proper path tracing support.</p>



<p>In the aforementioned interview with Gaijin, we also inquired about the Nintendo Switch 2 and whether there would be any port of War Thunder and/or Enlisted for the new console. Here's what CEO Anton Yudintsev told us:</p>



<p><em><strong>Anton Yudintsev (CEO:</strong> We’re always eager to be among the first to support new devices, so we’re definitely considering Switch 2 versions of our games. Unfortunately, right now we’re still waiting for the requested Switch 2 dev kits.</em></p>



<p>If a developer the size of Gaijin is still waiting for their Switch 2 devkits, it seems like the situation hasn't improved much since <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our previous report on the devkits shortage in July</a>. This is unfortunate, as many developers would be very eager to port their games to the highly successful console.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-free-dlc-release-date-reveal-november/</link>

			<p>After confirming that Assassin's Creed Mirage <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-indeed-getting-new-free-content-later-this-year/">would indeed be getting a DLC update this past August</a>, Ubisoft revealed the full free DLC today, titled Valley of Memory, which is set to arrive on all platforms this coming November 18, 2025.</p>



<p>The free DLC update will add a new region for players to explore called AlUla, a historical setting placed right in the middle of the Incense Road from the Golden Age of the Abbasid Empire. Ubisoft worked with archeologists and historians to ensure it could recreate AlUla as accurately as possible for this new DLC to showcase what this bustling trade-hub would have looked like during the 9th century.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Valley of Memory will feature an entirely new storyline that's part of Basim's coming-of-age journey, with this DLC specifically revolving around his search for his father. Beyond the main arc of this new DLC, there will also be new contracts, side quests, and some highly-requested gameplay changes, namely the ability to replay missions at your leisure. It also adds a new faction of Robbers for Basim to deal with. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has also further expanded the gameplay in Mirage by adding a new tier to tool upgrades, new parkour abilities like being able to jump manually and refinements for the less-populated northern region of AlUla, where Basim will be climbing rocky terrains instead of the ubran areas of Baghdad.</p>



<p>When Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">first released Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, new DLC content wasn't initially part of the plan. This DLC eventually happened partly because of the positive reception Mirage got, though more significantly because of Ubisoft's partnership with Savvy Games Group, the videogames-focused investment company founded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). The same PIF that will be one of the lead investors <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">acquiring EA and making the company go private.</a></p>
