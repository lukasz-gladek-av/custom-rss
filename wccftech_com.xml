			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-spoils-007-first-light-villain-ahead-of-the-game-awards-2025/">After it leaked earlier today</a> from the official 007 First Light account, IO Interactive has now officially announced that Lenny Kravitz is stepping into the role of Bawma, and appears to be the main antagonist that James Bond will face in the plot of 007 First Light.</p>



<p>While fans of Kravitz will know that this is not his first time stepping into a role as an actor, it does appear to be his first time acting in a video game. This makes 007 First Light a new frontier for Kravitz in a couple of ways, since this is also seemingly his first time in the role of a villain.</p>



<p>And not just any villain, but a Bond villain to boot, with his own pet alligators he can use to threaten his enemies, as he appears to do so in the trailer shown at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>

<p>The new trailer takes us to a remote location called Aleph, a black market city in Africa built by Lenny Kravitz's pirate character, Bawma. It's unclear if this is where the story of IO Interactive's Bond ends, but it is definitely a stop along the way.</p>



<p>007 First Light is due to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">this coming March 27, 2026</a>.

<p>The new look at Lords of the Fallen II isn't the only news related to the franchise today. The original Lords of the Fallen received its final update, update 2.5, which builds on the improvements introduced in update 2.0 "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">by further refining the flow of battle across both Legacy mode (the base experience), and all-new Veteran mode,</em>" both of which sport <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1501750/view/649211284269564005?l=english">more brutal boss battle</a></strong><strong><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1501750/view/649211284269564005?l=english">s</a></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1501750/view/649211284269564005?l=english"> and more</a></strong>.

			<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight from developer TT Games got a brand new gameplay trailer and the reveal of its release date at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, as it is set to arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on May 29, 2026.</p>



<p>Initially announced during <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">Gamescom's 2025 ONL Show</a>, Legacy of the Dark Knight was described as the "<em>definitive</em>" Batman story and experience, as it spans across Batman eras with the whimsical tone you'd expect from a LEGO game. </p>



<p>Tonight's gameplay and release date trailer is chock-full of that whimsical tone, and all the humour and gameplay variety that made every LEGO game from TT Games worth checking out for years. This latest entry, however, seems to add new layers of complexity to the gameplay and combat system. </p>

<iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Heroes &amp; Villains Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xciD-Vz6T_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>With the combat system, our goal has been to offer an experience that is different from previous LEGO and LEGO Batman games, while keeping the trademark LEGO movement and humor fans have come to love and expect</em>," writes TT Games community manager Gehan Amaranayke in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-out-may-29-2026-on-ps5/">PlayStation Blog post.</a> "<em>As groups of enemies grow larger and better-equipped, even Batman needs help. That’s where the other members of the DC Bat-Family come in</em>."</p>



<p>Amaranayke also points to another old classic aspect of LEGO games updated for Legacy of the Dark Knight. In most LEGO games, you can collect and swap between characters included in whatever franchise the LEGO game you're playing is based on. In Legacy of the Dark Knight, you can play as other Batman characters, though their differing abilities seem to go a little deeper than they do in previous games.</p>



<p><em>"Detective Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, and Catwoman will join Batman throughout the campaign. Each partner has unique gadgets and abilities showcasing their special skills and distinctive personality in combat. You saw Jim Gordon’s foam sprayer in action when we first announced the game at Gamescom in Germany. In this new trailer, you’ll see Robin using his circus training acrobatics, Batgirl with her hackarang to bypass security systems and take remote control of machinery, and Nightwing joins the party in with his battle staff. You’ll also notice Catwoman calling on her feline friends to distract and attack enemies and using her whip and cartwheel kicks to take out the baddies.</em>"</p>



<p>All together, Legacy of the Dark Knight is looking like it has the potential to be the best LEGO game yet, which is a high bar considering more than a few of TT Games' titles are some of the best family oriented 3D action platforming experiences out there, even to this day.</p>
