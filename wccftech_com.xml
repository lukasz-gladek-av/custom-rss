			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada should start next week, according to a very reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Earlier today, known leaker <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billbil-kun.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billbil-kun</a> revealed that from what they can see through some Canadian retailers, pre-orders for the next-generation Nintendo console and bundles launching this June will start next week, on April 23rd. Unfortunately, the leaker couldn't confirm if pre-orders in the United States will also begin next week.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in the whole of North America were supposed to start last week, but they were ultimately delayed in the United States first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">assess the potential impact of tariffs</a>. Pre-orders in Canada were later delayed in order to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/">align with the timing of pre-orders in the US</a>, so there's a good chance that those living in the United States may be able to pre-order the console next week if pre-orders in Canada will indeed begin on April 23rd.</p>
<p>If the current situation doesn't change, there's little doubt that the tariffs will impact the Nintendo Switch 2 price, although it is not yet known in which capacity. An internal assessment memo from a major Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by Nikkei Asia suggests that the console is in<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/"> line for a significant price increase</a> as long as game consoles made in China will be subject to a 145% tariff in the United States. The PlayStation 5 could also see a price increase in the United States due to the tariffs, a price increase that would follow the one announced for the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">this week.</a></p>
