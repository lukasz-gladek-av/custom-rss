			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is about to become an even better-looking game with the NaturalVision Enhanced mod, which promises to bring the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>The new version of the popular mood now available for the original version of the game has been showcased this week with some brand new screenshots that highlight the stunning visual improvements it will bring. In addition to the brand new improvements, the developer behind the mod, Razed, confirmed on <a href="https://discord.gg/gtav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> that they have been able to enable an unused feature in Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition which casts additional shadows from all light resources, resulting in more depth and detail in the vast majority of scenarios, as highlighted in some <a href="https://content.razedmods.com/enhanced">comparison screenshots</a>. A release date for the mod, which will be launched for free, has yet to be confirmed, but a trailer is already in the works, so it shouldn't be long until we see more of this mod in actual action.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is, without a doubt, the best way to experience the fifth entry in the series ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI release later this year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. In addition to providing a great experience that looks better than ever, the new version of the game is likely also a<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/"> preview of some of the tech</a> players should expect to see in the upcoming new entry in the series, although it will be only until the PC version until the game's gorgeous visuals will run at anything beyond 30 FPS if how the Enhanced Edition runs on CPUs on par with those powering current generation consoles is of any indication.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about this version of the game in Alessio's<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/"> analysis.</a></p>
