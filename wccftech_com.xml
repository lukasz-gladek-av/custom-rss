			<p>Developer and publisher Exor Studios has just released the latest update for The Riftbreaker, which includes a few significant features for the game. Update 2.0 introduces four-player online co-op to The Riftbreaker, along with an expanded campaign, an overhaul to the loot system, new Omega-Strain creatures, and more.</p>



<p>The update is available right now for PC players through Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG, though Windows Store players and players on console will have to wait, as the update will be available there "<em>at a later date</em>," according to the studio in a press release.</p>



<p>Exor Studios also debuted a new trailer for the update, which showcases co-op gameplay, some of the new creatures you'll face, and shots of the expanded campaign for veterans looking for more to do in the endgame.</p>

<p>Regarding the expanded campaign, this update introduces a new story arc centering around Megastructures, and is fully voiced with Francesca Meaux and Ryan Laughton returning to their roles as Ashley and Mr. Riggs, respectively. </p>



<p>The Omega-Strain creatures are more powerful versions of existing creatures and enemies you've already faced, though thanks to their added punch, taking them down will score you an even bigger reward. They also feature various elemental types that will encourage you to switch up your approach depending on the situation.</p>



<p>Exor Studios has also overhauled the loot system with Update 2.0, and crafting is no longer the only way to obtain new gear. You'll now see new gear appear as loot from enemy creatures, Biocaches, and Bioanomalies. There's also a number of balance adjustments in the update, including tweaks to weapons, research, quality-of-life improvements, and even a few optimization improvements to help the game perform better on your device.</p>



<p>The Riftbreaker is a base-building action-RPG that<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-riftbreaker-an-ephemeral-paradise/"> first launched in 2021</a>, and has been updated several times since launch, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-riftbreaker-metal-terror-dlc-more-of-the-same/">new expansions</a> and balancing updates. </p>
