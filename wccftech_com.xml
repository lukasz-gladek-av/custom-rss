			<p>Days after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-new-leaked-footage/">last footage leak</a>, more Battlefield 6 gameplay has found its way online, this time with more than 90 minutes of gameplay allegedly captured on PS5 being posted online.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/massive-battlefield-6-labs-playtest-leak-90-minutes-of-gameplay/">TheGamePost</a>, the footage comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzXJkH9_rNE">Gambf</a>&nbsp;and shows the menu screen as it currently is, matchmaking, loadout screens, map screens while in-game, and then gameplay from multiple matches.</p>
<p>To be clear, the player who captured and uploaded the footage has broken the NDA they signed to participate in the playtest in the first place, so anyone who does this risks facing EA's legal wrath.</p>
<p>But for players who are excitedly looking forward to the next Battlefield game and want to learn all they can about it, but have not yet been invited to the playtest, this footage is an excellent look inside what EA has been cooking up in the Battlefield Labs testing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield Labs playtest Ps5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lzXJkH9_rNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What is nice about this footage is that it further confirms what we've already started to see from the snippets that EA has officially shared. The gameplay is returning to a more classic style of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">Battlefield destruction</a>, and players can expect intense firefights in matches across intricate maps that can be destroyed in big ways or piece by piece.</p>
<p>For example, multiple points in the footage show the maps being destroyed and broken down in small ways by stray bullets and in bigger ways by rockets, tanks, and heavier artillery.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like this is shaping up to be a big improvement from Battlefield 2042, and hopefully we'll all be able to get our hands on it without signing an NDA before the end of the year.</p>
