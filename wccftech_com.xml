			<p>Do you remember that game from <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Glowmade</strong> at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-and-glowmade-reveal-king-of-meat-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom ONL 2024</a></strong> that put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oykf2q9_LM"><strong>Geoff Keighley </strong>in its trailer</a> and looked like a more medieval version of <strong>Fall Guys</strong>? No? Well, to remind you (unless you're <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1926980/charts/">one of the 10 people playing it on Steam right now </a>who need no reminder), that game was <strong>King of Meat</strong>, a co-op party platformer that dropped four friends into a medieval, community-built obstacle course.</p>



<p>That's what King of Meat was, with 'was' being the keyword here, because today, Amazon and Glowmade announced on <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us">the game's official website</a> that its servers are going to get <strong>shut down</strong> on <strong>April 9, 2026</strong>. It has already been delisted from all storefronts, and anyone who did buy it, whether at its <strong>$30</strong> price or its more common sales prices, will be <strong>getting a refund</strong>.</p>



<p>The game initially launched on <strong>October 2, 2025,</strong> and while we can't know how popular it was on its console platforms, SteamDB can tell us that it never had more than <strong>320</strong> people playing it at one time, a number that it didn't even hit at launch, but a month after launch, during a free weekend trial period. Its 24-hour peak currently sits at 10 players.</p>



<p>Depressing as these numbers may be to read, they are, according to Amazon and Glowmade's statement, the reason the game is getting shut down. "<em>Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has <strong>unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for</strong>. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat's servers will close on <strong>April 9, 2026</strong>. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders</em>." </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The statement is then followed by a message written in all-caps, which reads, "<em>All players who purchased King of Meat <strong>will receive a full refund in the coming weeks from their platform provider</strong>."</em> So whether you jumped in at launch, hoping this would be the next big multiplayer game, or gave it a shot after its free trial weekend, you'll be getting your money back.</p>



<p>Amazon and Glowmade have also turned off the game's microtransactions, so the only thing left to do in King of Meat is to enjoy the game if you already own a copy of it.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to sincerely thank every player who supported King of Meat and the wonderful community that formed around it. Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We're grateful for Glowmade's partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future</em>," Amazon concludes. </p>



<p>When King of Meat was first announced at Gamescom 2024, we got the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/king-of-meat-gamescom-2024-qa-it-is-an-obvious-good-fit-for-streaming-streamers-really-enjoyed-it/">preview the game and speak to the development team at Glowmade</a>. Even at the time, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo identified that despite its run-of-the-mill gameplay, its capacity for user-generated content could be the thing that established King of Meat as a must-play multiplayer game. </p>



<p>The studio even seemed to imply that it was built as a game that could be extremely popular on Twitch, adding that "<em>It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming</em>," and that the studio had "<em>a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it.</em>"</p>



<p>Clearly, its strategy of designing for content creators and streaming, and seemingly relying on influencers to help get the game going, did not pan out. Even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1drt0O2U8DY">Mr. Beast collab</a> that arrived just as the game launched was unable to do anything for it.</p>



<p>There's been no word from the Glowmade team as to how it is moving forward from here, though the website's statement does seem to imply its partnership with Amazon has concluded. Hopefully, the studio is able to come together around its next project, because whatever your thoughts on King of Meat, it's clear that, despite missing the mark with this game, Glowmade is an extremely capable studio. We'll see if they get another kick at the can.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Confirms That Cheaters in Marathon Will be “Permabanned” When Caught, “No Second Chances”]]></title>

			<p><strong>Bungie's</strong> upcoming first-person PvEvP extraction shooter, <strong>Marathon</strong>, will be out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S in a little more than a week from the time of this writing, and as you might expect, there has been a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/">communication and marketing from the team</a> as we get closer to the game's release.</p>



<p>The most recent of which arrived today, in the form of a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">new blog post</a> on the official Bungie website, all to do with the game's networking and security. The blog post highlights the game's dedicated server networking and how elements like Fog of War limit the usability of things like wall-hacks, while also explaining what happens if you find yourself disconnected from a game.</p>



<p>One point it hammers home, though, is that if you are caught cheating in Marathon, you are forever <strong>banned</strong> from the game. "<em><strong>Anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever, no second chances</strong></em>," the blog post reads in its initial bullet-point summary.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re investing in networking and security for Marathon:</p><p>🖥️Dedicated servers<br>🤖Server-side authority over key actions to reduce exploits<br>😶‍🌫️Fog of War to limit wall hacks and loot revealers<br>⛓️‍💥Disconnect recovery<br>🛑No second chances </p><p>Learn more: <a href="https://t.co/CBTJ1wGDVi">https://t.co/CBTJ1wGDVi</a> <a href="https://t.co/FT2fXQgyIp">pic.twitter.com/FT2fXQgyIp</a></p></div>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2025963870045843652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We are taking a strong stance against cheating</em>," the post adds towards the end of the blog post, "<em>and anyone found to be cheating or developing cheats will be permanently banned from playing Marathon forever, no second chances</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>That said, no system is perfect, so we will have an appeals system to monitor for any issues in detection</em>." So if you are mistakenly banned for cheating, you will have the chance to regain access to Marathon, but it seems like Bungie is doing its best to take a hardcore stance against cheaters in its upcoming shooter.</p>



<p>Which is understandable, considering how toxic cheaters can be to a multiplayer community. Once enough of them begin to crop up in lobbies, it makes the idea of going back to the game for players who don't want to cheat impossible to consider. It doesn't even have to be that you experience cheaters in every match you play; sometimes, all it takes is consistently running into cheaters all at once in a single session for players to have seen enough evidence that cheaters are ruining their gameplay experience.</p>



<p>Marathon arrives on PC and current-gen consoles on <strong>March 5, 2026</strong>, and if you're looking to try it out before dropping <strong>$40</strong> to buy it, you'll be able to try it out on your platform of choice this coming weekend, starting on February 26, during its <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">open-preview server slam test.</a></p>
