			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't feature any of the additional content found in the War of the Lions release and the mobile versions of the game, but this could quickly become a thing of the past, as a new mod now available online restores a small portion of this additional content.</p>



<p>The WotL Character Repair mod, developed by Dana Crysalis and now available for download for free from Nexus Mods, fixes Balthier and Luso, making it possible to add them to the party via Cheat Engine tables and use them in battle with their unique Jobs and ability sets. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there's no way to add the two characters to the game without using Cheat Engine due to how difficult it currently is to add new events to the game. Installation requires using the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/tag/1.29.2">Reloaded-II loader</a>, which can be less intuitive than just dropping some files into an installation folder.  Still, these are only minor inconveniences, considering the value of the mod.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-The-Ivalice-Chronicles-Balthier-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Balthier and Lus</em><em>o</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> are now fully functional in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles thanks to this new mod</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Curious to see how well this new Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles mod works, I briefly tested it and can confirm that it indeed works as intended. I was able to add both Balthier and Luso to a battle party and use them as if they were a regular vanilla unit, which is not possible to do without this Repair mod, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-war-of-the-lions-content/">as my previous attempts testify</a>. Hopefully, more fixes will come for the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs to make them usable and further expand the game's content.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not the definitive version of the popular tactical role-playing game, lacking the aforementioned War of the Lions content, this new release is more than worth playing thanks to the many improvements it brings. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">You can learn more about them by checking out my review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-reportedly-cancelled-again-amidst-amazon%E2%80%99s-mass-layoffs.1339423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst a massive layoff at Amazon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">which cut 14,000+ employees</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">killed further development of New World: Aeternum</a>, has also reportedly killed (for a second time) the Lord of the Rings MMO that was in production at Amazon Game Studios.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, a now former Amazon Game Studios senior gameplay engineer, Ashleigh Amrine, confirmed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">in a post on her personal LinkedIn page</a> that the "<em>fledgling Lord of the Rings game</em>" was part of the cuts at Amazon.</p>



<p>"<em>This morning I was part of layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (ya'll would have loved it),</em>" Amrine writes. "<em>It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this - I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here</em>."</p>



<p>Amazon has yet to officially confirm that its Lord of the Rings game, which had <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canceled-due-to-contractual-dispute-between-tencent-and-amazon/">already been cancelled once before due to a contract dispute with Tencent</a>, has been cancelled again now as part of these layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/">after it was revived in 2023</a>. </p>



<p>When it was confirmed that further development on New World had ceased, we reached out to Amazon for a comment on the status of the Lord of the Rings MMO. But Amrine's statement here, compounded with the statement from Steve Boom, Amazon's head of audio, Twitch and games, seems to confirm what we already suspected, that we will not see a new Lord of the Rings MMO anytime soon.</p>



<p>Boom called the cuts to Amazon Game Studios "<em>significant</em>" and specifically called out MMOs as a genre in which Amazon is halting first-party development work.</p>



<p>After the MMO was revived for the first time in 2023, we also learned it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-very-different-from-new-world-will-use-a-next-gen-version-of-its-engine/">built on a next-generation version of the engine </a>that was used to develop New World. A little more than a year after its revival, Amazon Game Studios boss Christoph Hartmann stated that the Lord of the Rings MMO <a href="https://wccftech.com/christoph-hartmann-says-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-still-early/">was still in "<em>early</em>" stages</a>, which made sense given that production had only picked back up a year prior.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that early status also means it makes sense for Amazon to cut its losses without hesitation, as it was unclear how much work from the previous iteration of the game would be picked up following its first cancellation, and it might've been starting from scratch.</p>



<p>We'll update this article if Amazon does make a more official comment on the status of the Lord of the Rings MMO. For now, though, don't hold your breath on it being shown off at a future Summer Game Fest or similar event.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-nvidia-dlss-4-better-performance-multi-frame-generation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-arrives-with-nvidia-dlss-4-with-3-6x-performance-boost-on-rtx-50-series-gpus.1339378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>ARC Raiders is out today on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, but more importantly for PC players, Embark Studios' latest arrives with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex. Furthermore, if you have an RTX 50 Series graphics card in your PC, then you'll be able to multiply the frame rates you see in ARC Raiders by an average of 3.6X, even when playing at 4K.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/arc-raiders-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-out-now/">According to NVIDIA</a>, when playing ARC Raiders on an RTX 50 Series card, with DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation while also using DLSS Super Resolution, you can "<em>multiply performance by 3.6X on average at 4K, with game settings maxed and ray tracing enabled</em>."</p>



<p>With an RTX 5090 in your machine, at 4K with the settings maxed, you'll be able to reach 420 FPS, and with an RTX 5080, over 300 FPS. An RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will let you reach 260 FPS and 220 FPS, respectively. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, lowering the resolution to 1440p or 1080p will boost your frame rates even further, with an RTX 5090 hitting over 500 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Super Resolution enabled for ARC Raiders, with all settings maxed out, at 1440p. Even if you're sporting an RTX 5060, you'll be able to hit over 190 FPS at 1440p, and up to 245 FPS at 1080p.</p>



<p>Even with a laptop RTX 5060 graphics card, at 1080p, you'll be able to reach 240 FPS, and if you have an RTX 5090 laptop graphics card, you'll reach 423 FPS at 1080p. A laptop RTX 5090 will also be able to reach above 300 FPS while playing at 1440p.</p>



<p>Along with ARC Raiders, there are a few other titles adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Battlefield 6's new Battlefield REDSEC</a> battle royale mode, Duet Night Abyss, and Directive 8020. It was also just confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-to-launch-globally-2026-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/">AION 2 will arrive in 2026 with support for DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/war-sails-naval-expansion-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-out-november-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-sails-the-naval-expansion-for-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-is-out-on-november-26.1339375/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, independent developer TaleWorlds Entertainment has confirmed the release date of War Sails, the upcoming expansion for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.</p>



<p>War Sails was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally scheduled to launch in June</a>, though it was ultimately delayed by TaleWorlds. The expansion is now set to go live on November 26 at 00:00 Pacific Time, 03:00 Eastern Time, 09:00 Central European Time. It will be a simultaneous release on PC and consoles (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X). Pricing has been confirmed to be $24.99.</p>



<p>The announcement was paired with an extensive gameplay showcase that demonstrated the expansion's main features. Players learned that a Custom Naval Battles mode will be available to instantly create and command fleet engagements on River, Coastal, or Open Sea maps. This mode is a great way to test tactics, experiment with ship setups, or jump straight into action without campaign progression. The naval warfare was inspired by historic medieval battles and will require players to master the physics of wind and water. Boarding and ramming ships, as well as crippling enemies by shattering their oars, sinking their hulls, or tearing their sails, are all viable tactics.</p>



<p>War Sails also adds the Northern Kingdom, home to the fearless Nords. Here, players will trade, recruit, or fight in a land of jagged peaks and icy fjords. Of course, this also means that Calradia has been expanded to include a northern sea, islands, rivers, and open waters, with players able to sail past barriers, resupply, and engage in combat on land and sea.</p>



<p>At launch, players will find 18 ships to choose from, each with unique handling characteristics influenced by wind and waves. Ships can be upgraded with siege engines, sails, and rams. They can be purchased or captured, and ports may also be upgraded. </p>



<p>In War Sails, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord will get to sail rivers and seas to strike deep into enemy territory. It'll be pivotal to keep the armies supplied, sink enemy ships and blockade their towns, while keeping an eye out for stormy weather. The expansion also introduces new companions, unique weapons, Nordic banners, hairstyles, tattoos, and armor.</p>
