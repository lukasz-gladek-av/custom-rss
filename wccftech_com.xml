			<p>PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has released the first gameplay trailer for its second project, the single-player open world survival game Prologue: Go Wayback. The Amsterdam-based developer also revealed that it will be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early access</a> starting this Summer for the rather low price of $20, which will not be increased after the end of the early access phase (estimated to be around a year).</p>
<p>In the game, players are dropped into a vast and wild landscape, equipped with just an old map and the basic tools to stay alive. The mission is simple: reach the weather station, but how to get there depends entirely on the player.</p>
<p>The world is dynamic and unpredictable. The weather can change at a moment's notice, forcing players to adapt to fierce storms and freezing temperatures. Gathering resources, finding shelter, and foraging for food will be essential. Extreme weather conditions can affect the character's stats. Items and even buildings found along the way can be repaired. Additionally, each playthrough will be completely different since it is generated by the studio's machine-learning technology.</p>

<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Brendan 'PlayerUnknown' Greene himself, diving deeply into his 10-plus-year plan to get the metaverse right. Prologue: Go Wayback follows the tech demo Preface: Undiscovered World (which is live now on Steam) and is a mid-step toward the final, full-fledged planet-sized massively multiplayer game codenamed Project Artemis. Unlike Preface and Artemis, it is made with Unreal Engine, albeit mixed with the studio's in-house custom machine learning terrain generation technology.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview, Greene said about Prologue: Go Wayback:</p>
<p><em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. It's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a testbed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em></p>

			<p>Continuing a process that began with Monster Hunter World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> attempts to further streamline the series formula to reduce the time players spend in menus and at the base camp to keep them on the field as much as possible, providing them with all the tools they need to effortlessly traverse the new open-world maps.</p>
<p>Among these new tools the game provides is the Seikret, a friendly Bird Wyvern that assists Hunters by giving them access to Supply items and an additional weapon while making traversal way faster than on foot. Unlike Monster Hunter Rise's Palamutes, which served a similar traversal purpose, however, Seikret don't really feel good to control due to some default control settings that the game never really explains unless the player goes through them manually.</p>

<p>The settings you will want to change as soon as you begin your adventure in Monster Hunter Wilds are the Call Seikret Controls (Radial Menu), and the Seikret Manual Controls found on the second page of the Controls menu in the main Options menu. The first one is, by default, set to Auto-move, which puts the Seikret into Auto-move after calling it from either a shortcut or the Radial Menu, which makes the Bird Wyvern head towards any highlighted target, whether it is a resource you have highlighted yourself on the map or any target monster. This option is far from being the best, as it wrestles control away from the player upon calling the Seikret, and having to press buttons to slow it down and make it stop feels clunky and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The Seikret Manual Controls option is even more important to change to have better control of the Seikret. The default option, Type 1, makes the Seikret move without player input, similar to Auto-move, as pressing nothing maintains the current speed, while additional button presses are required to slow it down and make it stop. Type 2 is a much, much better option in pretty much every scenario, as the Seikret will only move with directional inputs without needing additional button presses to change the beast's speed, just like controlling the Hunter. And if you still want the Seikret to bring you to your target automatically, you can still activate Auto-move at any time, so changing the Seikret controls this way will provide you with the best traversal options the game has to offer for all sorts of situations. If you're so used to how you call the Palamute in Monster Hunter Rise, you can also change the Call Seikret Controls option so as to be able to call the Seikret by holding the circle/B button with your weapon sheated.</p>
