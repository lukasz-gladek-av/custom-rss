			<p>Any title in the Xbox portfolio of games can be considered for a port on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, as Phil Spencer doesn't see a red line in this regard.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczMTQ5OTU0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzMyMTA0MzQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTVcxQ01UMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.UjaVdB-1hJKO1VKY0-vUQaOjf2cpmUgGaLSXNqqYnHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the head of Xbox commented on a variety of topics, including porting Xbox titles to other formats. Phil Spencer is pleased with the results of the first batch of games released on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch so far, and more will be coming in the future. In regard to which titles will make the jump in the future, the head of Xbox said that he sees no sort of red lines in their portfolio that say "thou must not," but it's definitely too early to make any sort of decision on the next entry in the Halo series. As such, it really sounds like nothing is off the table, although a day-and-date release on Xbox and other consoles at the same time doesn't sound very likely.</p>
<p>Phil Spencer also touched upon the handheld market, which has been thriving in the past few years. The head of Xbox said that the "expectation" is that the company is going to do something in this regard. At this stage, they are working on prototypes and considering the future, and Phil Spencer asked his team to look at the market and develop their device based on what is learned. This device, Spencer added, is a few years out, so we won't be seeing it anytime soon.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Xbox head Phil Spencer has talked about the rumored handheld, but it is the first time he commented on the matter in a more concrete way. As the device is still a few years away, however, there's no telling what it will be capable of doing and if it will be focused on local play, as Spencer himself hinted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/">earlier this year.</a></p>
