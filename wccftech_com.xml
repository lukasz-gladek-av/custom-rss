			<p>During our <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest 2025 interview with Tymon Smektała</a>, we asked the Techland Dying Light Franchise Director whether there were any plans to bring Dying Light: The Beast to the Nintendo Switch 2 console. Without promising anything, Smektała was very open about his desire to do it at some stage:</p>
<p><em>I would love this to happen at some point, but nothing to announce at this time.</em></p>
<p>On one hand, Techland's Director has detailed several technical improvements made to the C-Engine for Dying Light: The Beast:</p>
<p><em>We have also improved the visuals a lot. Our in-house C-Engine engine went through a number of iterations. Now, all the weather effects, the rendering of materials, lighting, shadows, and how the sun moves in the sky. All of those things are on a completely different level compared to Dying Light 2: Stay Human.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, the game is one of the very few to be still targeting a launch on old-generation consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) in 2025. As such, there's little doubt that the Nintendo Switch 2 could run the game in terms of raw power. It's rather a matter of opportunity, then. With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch sales</a> it's had so far, it would seem like a no-brainer to bring a game to Nintendo's console, but that doesn't mean it would be easy for the Polish developer.</p>
<p>The first Dying Light only launched on the Switch six and a half years after the game's original debut in 2015. It took the opportunity to gather all DLCs into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-platinum-edition-leaked-due-on-thursday-may-27th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platinum Edition</a> that launched everywhere and added the Switch version. Whether Techland plans to do the same for this 'unofficial third game' remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dying Light 2: Stay Human was announced to be coming to the original Nintendo Switch through a cloud version that, however, never materialized.</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco has announced it will host a Little Nightmares Showcase for next week on <strong>June 24, 2025, at 12pm PST / 5pm EST / 8pm BST</strong>.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a short post to the <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">Little Nightmares III official X account</a>, with a short video clip showing the date and time of the showcase and the caption "<em>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think. Are you ready to face it, little ones?</em>"</p>
<p>That's all Bandai shared about the showcase, though we can infer that it'll include good deal of information on the next entry in the Little Nightmares series, Little Nightmares III, which is still without an official release date after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gets-delayed-to-2025/">delayed last year</a> and pushed into 2025.</p>
<p>Though a release date hasn't been officially confirmed, a product listing for Little Nightmares III on Target (spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/539541/article/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-potentially-leaked/">Gameranx</a>) has the release date set for September 15, 2025. We'll find out next week if that leak was correct.</p>
<p>It'll also be interesting to see more of Little Nightmares III, as this is the first game in the series that isn't being developed by the series creators at Tarsier Studios. Supermassive Games has taken over the series, and while the initial clips and previews suggest that it'll stay very close to the kind of game Tarsier already established, Supermassive will undoubtedly bring their own flair to the games in some way.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gamescom-hand-on-preview-surviving-together/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo previewed the game at Gamescom 2024,</a> he wrote that from the top of the demo, "<em>there was no doubt that I was playing a Little Nightmares game. Everything was in the right place: the characters, the atmosphere, the tone, and the gameplay</em>."</p>
<p>So far, some of the key differences seem to be that the characters in Little Nightmares III can use a series of weapons, but no doubt, there are more changes yet to be revealed, even if it's all staying close to what we all know to be a Little Nightmares game.</p>

			<p>There's now two Death Stranding film adaptations in the works. The first is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-death-stranding-movie-has-found-a-writer-and-director-in-a-quiet-place-day-ones-michael-sarnoski/">A24 movie with Michael Sarnoski directing</a>, and the second is a newly announced animated film being made by animation studio Line Mileage in collaboration with Kojima Productions, with Raised by Wolves creator Aaron Guzikowski signed on to write the script.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/death-stranding-animated-adaptation-aaron-guzikowski-writer-1236436519/">Deadline</a> reports that the film will be a more mature-focused animated feature, and will center a new story in the Death Stranding universe that has not been explored in the games.</p>
<p>"<em>I love the world of Death Stranding,</em>" Guzikowski said in a statement to Deadline. "<em>It's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honored that Hideo Kojima, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe. Drawing and animation have always been near and dear to my heart, so to finally get to play in this space is a dream come true</em>."</p>
<p>Line Mileage's chief creative officer, Daniel Dominguez added "<em>As an avid gamer I can say, unequivocally, Death Stranding is the most cinematic, thought-provoking video game I have ever played. Playing it gave me the same emotional rush, visceral punch, and intellectual pleasure I had the first time I watched Blade Runner, or Ghost in the Shell. Adapting it into a form it so naturally evokes is an honor. And for Aaron Guzikowski to lend his talents, whose authorial mind and creative energy humble me...needless to say, this project is a dream come true</em>."</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is due a week from this current time of writing, and now with two movie adaptations in the works, it's clear we'll be hearing about this series for a long time to come. Whether that's in a good or bad way remains to be seen with how the next game and these subsequent adaptations do.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-changed-death-stranding-2-wasn-t-polarizing-enough/">recent interview with Rolling Stone,</a> co-composer for Death Stranding 2, Woodkid, revealed that Hideo Kojima's reactions to players being extremely positive about how the game was shaping up in early playtests were to change it and make it more polarizing. Kojima wasn't satisfied with positive responses across the board, he wanted to see more people react differently than just delivering full praise.</p>
<p>It's still unclear how deeply involved Kojima will be in both the A24 live-action adaptation and Line Mileage's animated adaptation, but the litmus test for both, as to how well they work as adaptations of a Hideo Kojima game, will undoubtedly be how differently people react to the narrative in each film.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-classics-emulator-enhancements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox is reportedly working on its Classics programs together with the team behind a popular emulator to bring original Xbox and 360 games to PC and Game Pass, complete with enhancements.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today, known Xbox Game Pass leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eXstas1s</a> revealed that Xbox is working with the Xenia Canary development team on a sort of Classics program to create an emulation platform that will bring old games to Series X and S, PC, Game Pass, and xCloud, complete with visual and performance enhancements. The launch of this program will coincide with the brand's 25th anniversary, and games will reportedly launch in multiple waves that will be announced throughout 2026. Among the games that will launch via this new emulation platform will be Fable 2, Skate 3, Gears of War 3, and Batman: Arkham Asylum. Many other titles, however, are also under consideration, with the team evaluating potential technical and licensing issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="EXCLUSIVA 🔥 XBOX + XENIA se UNEN para revivir juegos de XBOX 360 en PC, nube y GAME PASS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uub8TghbVSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Considering how much importance Microsoft placed on backward compatibility in the past few years, what Exstas1s revealed today sounds reasonable enough, and pretty exciting as well, as this program would bring to PC games that are not available to play natively, like the aforementioned Fable 2, and the original versions of Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden 2, to name a few. Still, we must take everything with a grain of salt until an official announcement is made.</p>
<p>Though we don't know if Microsoft is indeed working on this Classics program, we do know the company is hard at work on its next-generation hardware. Together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/">AMD</a>, Microsoft is building gaming silicon that will deliver the next generation of graphics innovation with better visual quality, immersive gameplay, and improvements offered by AI while maintaining compatibility with the existing library of Xbox Games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/">Dune: Awakening</a> has only been out for a little more than a week (even longer if you've been playing since its premium early access release), and players are already looking towards what's coming next for the game.</p>
<p>It'll still be a while before Funcom releases any major content updates, but one element we can expect, according to the studio's community manager, Ignasis Miró Sastre, is that the team will add more "<em>Hagga-Basin-like</em><em> maps</em>" in future updates.</p>
<p>Writing on the Dune: Awakening Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">Eurogamer</a>), Sastre wrote, "<em>I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content.</em>"</p>
<p>Hagga Basin is the starting area in Dune: Awakening, where players can start finding their <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/">sand legs</a> before traveling further into the desert, and eventually to the deep desert and the game's more PvP-focused areas.</p>
<p>It's an area of the game that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcojf7/to_the_surprise_of_nobody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">players have a strong fondness for</a>, if only because it doesn't have the same potential for the kinds of horror stories players have experienced with a trip into the deep desert. A new area like Hagga Basin would be more than welcomed by Dune: Awakening players, to have that same well-curated exploration on Arrakis that Hagga Basin delivers in a fresh way.</p>
<p>And it'll feel even better since it'll likely be free, as Sastre later comments that "<em>Content will come as part of free updates, as far as I am aware. If it ever comes as part of a paid package, I imagine it would be because it's something big. But for now I think we have said we plan to release content for free, and then optional stuff via optional DLCs so we can actually afford rent, lights, and pineapple on pizza</em>."</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll be able to hear about whatever the next Hagga-Basin-like map is soon, and it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we did, since the studio also just confirmed in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/comment/mymv65a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit AMA</a> that it plans to release PvE-focused content "<em>every 3/4 months</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out,</em>" Funcom wrote in response to a question about PvE plans. "<em>Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months</em>."</p>
<p>So for now, we can look to sometime in September/October for when the next major batch of content is out for Dune: Awakening. Though, the studio also stipulates <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/comment/myn27y3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">elsewhere in the AMA</a> that while it will always communicate its plans for what's next in the game with the community, it might not necessarily publish a static roadmap.</p>
<p>So far, Dune: Awakening is having an incredibly strong launch, with a new concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">189,333</a> players that was reached this past weekend. It'll be interesting to see how the game continues to grow with the coming updates.</p>
