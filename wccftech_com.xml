			<p><strong>Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</strong>, a brand new 2D game in <strong>KONAMI</strong>'s revered series, was announced yesterday <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the State of Play</a>. This year, the franchise celebrates its <strong>40th anniversary</strong>, and fans are thrilled not only because of the new game (the first since <strong>2014's Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</strong>) but also because KONAMI <strong>has confirmed it's just the first in a series of new projects</strong>.</p>



<p>Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is set more than two decades after the events of <strong>Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</strong> and the recent animated series on Netflix. It takes place in the streets of <strong>15th-century Paris</strong>, where a new chapter of the legendary House Belmont is about to be written in bloody red ink. Armed with the legendary holy whip "Vampire Killer", the protagonist, Trevor Belmont's successor, must descend into the French capital city <strong>under attack by monstrous creatures</strong>, making his way to a looming mystical castle to hunt down the beasts and save the Parisians from eternal darkness.</p>



<p>Long-time fans and newcomers to the franchise <strong>will have to master different weapons and spells</strong> if they hope to defeat these foes. Moreover, the developers (<strong>Evil Empire</strong> and <strong>Motion Twin</strong>) suggested that <strong>thoroughly exploring the castle will benefit daring players</strong>. New areas are rich with secrets and puzzles to uncover, as well as deadly traps that demand constant vigilance.</p>



<p>The iconic whip, a <strong>trademark of the Castlevania franchise</strong>, returns with renewed purpose and will now serve as a vital traversal tool, <strong>allowing players to swing across diverse areas to uncover hidden rooms</strong> and reach previously inaccessible areas. Mastery of the whip’s mechanics also unlocks alternative combat possibilities, enabling players to strike enemies from unconventional positions.</p>

			<p>USA-based independent developer <strong>ProbablyMonsters</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we recently interviewed</a> about the launch of <strong>Storm Lancers</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>) was featured <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the State of Play broadcast</a> with an interesting new game called <strong>Crimson Moon</strong>. It's an action/adventure roleplaying game with optional co-op with another player. The setting is "<strong>Gothic High Renaissance</strong>"; the protagonist is a half-human, half-angel <strong>Nephilim</strong> born of a forbidden union and sworn to protect humanity as a <strong>Knight of the Crimson Moon</strong>.</p>



<p>The game takes place in <strong>Gildenarch</strong>, a once grand metropolis <strong>now overrun by the Infernal Legion</strong> and a corruption known as "<strong>Hellgrowth</strong>". As players reclaim the city district by district, they will uncover the secrets behind the titular Order of the Crimson Moon and the city's fall. The narrative culminates in a high-stakes confrontation with <strong>Solomon Moore</strong>, a sinister vampire lord who engineered Gildenarch's demise.</p>



<p>The gameplay loop is built around <strong>intense, replayable missions</strong> rather than a continuous open world. Players embark on <strong>15 to 45-minute "runs" into the demon-infested street</strong>s, where dynamic maps and evolving enemy compositions ensure that no two incursions feel the same. Combat is described as <strong>fast, visceral, and "Souls-inspired,"</strong> emphasizing mastery and skill expression with parries and finishers. As a Nephilim, <strong>players can wield divine abilities and unleash explosive celestial transformations</strong> to instantly reshape the battlefield.</p>



<p>Between missions, players will return to the <strong>Sanctus Clypeus</strong> (the Church's headquarters), a living hub where they can upgrade persistent stats, craft gear at the Blacksmith, and interact with various non-playable characters (NPCs) before planning their next move at the War Table.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, Crimson Moon <strong>features optional co-op</strong> that is designed to amplify the game's intensity. Cooperative play <strong>unlocks unique synergies,</strong> allowing players to combine abilities for devastating attacks and revive one another when overwhelmed by the Hellgrowth. The game utilizes <strong>dynamic difficulty scaling</strong> to keep the challenge high regardless of the group size.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest surprises of <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a> was undoubtedly the announcement of <strong>Project Windless</strong>. An open world action RPG in development at <strong>KRAFTON Montréal</strong>, it is based on the "<strong>The Bird That Drinks Tears</strong>" fantasy universe created by the Korean novelist <strong>Lee Youngdo</strong>, which has been described as "<strong>The Korean Lord of the Rings</strong>".  <strong>Patrik Méthé</strong>, Head of KRAFTON Montréal Studio and Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world. For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. Project Windless is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play.</em></p>



<p>Project Windless is technically <strong>a prequel set 1,500 years before the events narrated in Youngdo's books</strong>, a common choice for game developers whenever they want to draw from lore while maintaining complete creative freedom. The story will focus on the origins of the "<strong>Hero King</strong>," the legendary founder of the <strong>Aragit Kingdom</strong>. The setting features four unique races:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Tokabi:</strong> Tricksters who wield fire and magic, known for laughing in the face of death.</li>



<li><strong>The Humans:</strong> Ambitious and strategic, constantly vying to shift the balance of power.</li>



<li><strong>The Naga:</strong> A cold-blooded and brilliant reptilian race, driven by a ruthless desire for domination.</li>



<li><strong>The Rekkon:</strong> The bird-like playable race. Fierce, nomadic warriors of immense size and speed, driven by a singular "life wish."</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6NK4164iY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the first developer diary</a>, KRAFTON Montréal, which is working alongside KRAFTON teams based in teams in Pangyo, South Korea, to ensure authenticity, <strong>the combat was described as brutal, visceral, and overwhelming</strong>. In the lore, Rekkon warriors have immense strength, so <strong>players will often face dozens or even hundreds of enemies simultaneously</strong>. To achieve this scale, the team behind Project Windless is using a new "<strong>Mass Entity AI</strong>" technology. This system allows for the simulation of hundreds or thousands of smart, reactive characters. The goal is to transform standard encounters into unpredictable, large-scale conflicts that simulate the feel of a world truly torn by war.</p>



<p>Project Windless is being developed as a <strong>premium single player experience for PC and consoles</strong>. There's no release window in sight.</p>
