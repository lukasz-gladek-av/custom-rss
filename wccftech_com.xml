<p>"The Green Beret couldn't have said it better with his iconic phrase 'Consider it done,'" said JÃ¼rgen Reusswig, Studio Director at Claymore Game Studios. "After more than four years of setting up a new studio, design and development and the invaluable community feedback from <a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-demo-released-for-pc-and-xbox-series-sx/">various playtests</a>, operation 'Release' is a go for Commandos: Origins."</p>
<p>There will be multiple editions available, with the option to purchase the Commandos: Origins - Deluxe Edition. This will offer the diehard fans some exclusive content as well as some nostalgic skins from Commandos 2. There will be six Commando skins from Commandos 2 adapted for Commandos: Origins in total. There is also a 3D printing template for the Green Beret, a digital Commandos: Origins calendar, and the Original Soundtrack.</p>
<p>If you're excited to get stuck into this well-loved franchise, you won't have to wait too much longer. The release is set for April 9, 2025, and will also be available on Xbox Game Pass for console and PC if you just aren't sure whether you want to put some money towards it. This will be a great way to take the game for a test run and see if it's up to scratch.</p>
<p>For those who like a physical copy of their games, the Retail editions for Windows PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 will be available on May 22 and will include all of the content from the Deluxe Edition. If you want to purchase a Retail copy of the game, it will be available at $49.99. Additionally, for those on the previous generation of consoles, Commandos: Origins is set to release on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 later on in the year.</p>
