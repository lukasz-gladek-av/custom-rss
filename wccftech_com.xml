			<p>Veteran game designer Glen Schofield <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to IGN</a> during the Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show about his desire to get Dead Space 4 made. Schofield shared that he petitioned Electronic Arts 'recently', telling them he'd be able to make the former Visceral Games leadership return, and that he could save the publisher between 30 and 40 million dollars by reusing the assets created by Motive Studio for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 remake of the original game</a>. However, EA turned him down. It is unclear if he was referring to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-4-pitch-from-original-creators-was-rejected-by-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refused pitch he had already outlined nearly a year ago</a> or if he had already tried again at some point in 2025.</p>



<p>Regardless, Schofield, who co-created the franchise back when he was at Visceral Games, isn't giving up. In fact, he told IGN that there might be an opportunity following <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA's $55 billion leveraged buyout by a Consortium of investors</a>, and he's already 'making calls' to see that come to fruition:</p>



<p><em>We'll see. I don’t know where EA's head is right now. I don’t think they made money on the Dead Space remake. Dead Space needs to be adapted to different mediums — movies, TV series, it would be great. But I am more optimistic, because somebody new could buy the IP.</em></p>



<p>Schofield is definitely right about EA not making much profit from the remake of the first installment, which is why Motive's pitch for a remake of the second entry was denied and the sci-fi horror franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got put on hold once again</a>. </p>



<p>He might also be correct about the possibility of the publisher selling the IP. We know that after the leveraged buyout, EA will have to decrease its substantial debt with cost-cutting measures. That will likely involve layoffs, but analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have also discussed possible studio and/or franchise divestitures</a>. The widespread belief is that EA will consolidate around its top-performing franchises, such as the sports games and the Battlefield series, leaving little space for single player franchises like Dragon Age, Mass Effect, or Dead Space, which haven't always performed to their expectations.</p>



<p>It's interesting to see Glen Schofield taking an optimistic stance once again, though. In late July, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-the-callisto-protocol-directed-his-last-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confessed he might have directed his last game with The Callisto Protocol</a>, after he failed to secure backing for a new project. The Callisto Protocol was heavily inspired by Dead Space, but despite a big budget provided by Krafton, it was unable to meet the expectations of both fans and investors, leading to Schofield's departure from Striking Distance Studios.</p>
