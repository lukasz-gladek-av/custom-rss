			<p>Today, <strong>Nintendo</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported its <strong>Q3</strong> financial results</a>, revealing that the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> console has already sold <strong>17.37 million units</strong> as of December 31, 2025. As a reminder, the hybrid console <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted in stores on June 5, 2025</a>, and immediately set new sales records.</p>



<p>Last quarter, the game developer, publisher, and console manufacturer announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Switch 2 had reached <strong>10.36 million units</strong></a>. This means that in the last three months, Nintendo added <strong>7.01 million units</strong>. Sure, it was the Holiday quarter, but the figure remains nonetheless impressive. The company's forecast of <strong>19 million units</strong> sold by the end of the current fiscal year (in late March) seems not only achievable but also easy to surpass. At this trajectory, <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 should handily break the 20 million-unit milestone by then</strong>.</p>



<p>The <strong>original Switch</strong> is also still meaningfully contributing to Nintendo's bottom line. During the past quarter, the 9-year-old console still sold <strong>3.25 million units</strong>, which allowed it to surpass <strong>155 million units</strong> sold and thus officially take the top spot as Nintendo's best-selling console hardware ever, topping the <strong>Nintendo DS</strong>, which stopped at 154 million units. If its successor keeps this pace, though, it may eventually overtake it in a few years.</p>



<p>When it comes to game sales, Nintendo Switch 2 games are also doing well. The launch title <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a></strong> has now sold <strong>14.03 million units</strong>, although that includes bundle sales. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong: Bananza</a></strong> is already at <strong>4.25 million units</strong>, while <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a></strong> has sold <strong>1.76 million units</strong>.</p>



<p>The only slight decrease reported by Nintendo this quarter is in IP (intellectual property) sales, which were down 10.1% year over year due to lower movie-related revenue. However, that will soon be remedied <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-nintendo-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the imminent theatrical release of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a></strong>, <span>scheduled for&nbsp;<strong>April 1</strong>&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;</span>counted in Nintendo's next fiscal year. </p>



<p>Even with the lower IP sales, <strong>the company's net sales have increased by nearly 100% compared to last year thanks to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, totaling <strong>$12.25 billion</strong>. Operating profit rose by 21.3% to reach <strong>$1.93 billion</strong>, and ordinary profit went up by 51.3% to <strong>$2.93 billion</strong>.</p>

			<p>As you explore the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Poolside Cave</strong> in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> to help the Roamers complete their trial, you will come across a cryptic riddle in the cave's Underground Level 2 map : <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">“A chest that rests in a wintry bath, Will show us the Almighty's path.”</em></p>



<p>While your instinct in any RPG is to open every chest you see, this room is a minefield. Most of the treasure chests here are either completely empty or, far worse, are actually <strong>Canniboxes</strong> in disguise. These monsters are notorious for their high critical hit rate and their ability to cast <strong>Whack</strong> (the series' dreaded instant-death spell).</p>



<p><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">In my first playthrough, I learned the hard way that fighting these early on is a recipe for disaster,&nbsp; especially if you're playing at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/">high difficulty</a></strong>, so I highly recommend going straight for the&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"wintry bath"&nbsp;</em>and ignoring the decoys.</span></p>

<h3 id="h-finding-the-wintry-bath-chest"><strong>Finding the "Wintry Bath" Chest</strong></h3>



<p>To solve the puzzle and avoid a confrontation with a Cannibox, you need to head to the <strong>eastern side of the map</strong>. You will find a group of <strong>two chests</strong> sitting near a pool of water.</p>

<p>As soon as you interact with it, you will hear a distinct <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">rumbling noise</strong>. This is the signal that the puzzle has been solved and the path forward has opened.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/</link>

			<p><strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> introduces a level of flexibility never before seen in the series by offering three distinct difficulty presets: <strong>Easy Going</strong>, <strong>Happy Medium</strong>, and <strong>Tough Going</strong>. These roughly correspond to your traditional <em>Easy</em>, <em>Normal</em>, and <em>Hard</em> modes.</p>



<p>While these presets are a good starting point, the "reimagined" experience allows you to adjust every parameter individually, even during the game (<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Main Menu, Settings, Difficulty Level</strong>). After extensive testing, I have found that the default <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Happy Medium</strong> can still feel a bit too simple for both series veterans and those accustomed to RPG mechanics.</p>



<p>To achieve a playthrough that rewards strategy without becoming a tedious grind, I recommend a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Custom Balanced</strong> setup.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Difficulty-Settings-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The difficulty settings I have used in my first full playthrough of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Setting</strong></td><td><strong>Selection</strong></td><td><strong>Why it Works</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Damage Dealt</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Avoids making enemies feel like "damage sponges."</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Experience Earned</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Maintains the game's native progression curve.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Proficiency Earned</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Keeps Vocation leveling steady and rewarding.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gold Acquired</strong></td><td><strong>More</strong></td><td>Reduces early-game poverty and increases gear options.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Strength</strong></td><td><strong>Strong</strong></td><td><strong>Essential</strong> to keep the Vocation system relevant.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Activity</strong></td><td><strong>Monsters Attack</strong></td><td>Keeps the tension high during field exploration.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Restore HP after Battle</strong></td><td><strong>Don't Restore</strong></td><td>Preserves the classic resource-management loop.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-why-these-settings">Why These Settings?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-dealt-normal"><strong>Damage Dealt: Normal</strong></h3>



<p>Reducing the damage your party deals has one unfortunate side effect: it prolongs battles with no tangible benefit to strategy.</p>



<p>I tested the difference between <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Normal</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Less</em> damage against two early-game Vicious enemies: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vicious Hammerhood</strong> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ballymolly Region</strong>) and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vicious Bodkin Archer</strong> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Emberdale Region</strong>). There was zero difference in the strategy required; I simply had to spend more turns using <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Healing Herbs</em> to conserve MP. It wasn't more fun—only more tedious.</p>



<h3 id="h-experience-amp-proficiency-normal"><strong>Experience &amp; Proficiency: Normal</strong></h3>



<p>The game is already quite generous with <strong>EXP</strong> and <strong>Proficiency Points</strong>. During my testing, I never felt the need to grind, as the game's balance is handled differently than traditional <em>Dragon Quest</em> games. Keeping these at <em>Normal</em> ensures you stay at the intended power level for the story without inadvertently out-leveling the content.</p>



<h3 id="h-gold-acquired-more"><strong>Gold Acquired: More</strong></h3>



<p>This comes down to personal preference, but <em>Dragon Quest</em> games are notoriously stingy with gold. While I understand you aren't meant to buy out every shop immediately, having more financial freedom early on makes the game significantly more enjoyable. It allows you to experiment with different gear setups rather than being locked into a single "optimal" purchase.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Boss-Fight-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>This difficulty settings made my first playthrough very enjoyable without making the experience overly frustrating</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-monster-strength-strong"><strong>Monster Strength: Strong</strong></h3>



<p>Because <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> is balanced differently than the original PlayStation or 3DS versions, the base game is generally quite easy. Anything lower than <strong>Strong</strong> results in combat encounters becoming a "walk in the park."</p>



<p>If you want to actually engage with the <strong>Vocation System</strong> and avoid steamrolling bosses and Elite enemies, setting Monster Strength to <strong>Strong</strong> is the only way to ensure the game's mechanics actually matter.</p>



<h3 id="h-restore-hp-after-battle-don-t-restore"><strong>Restore HP after Battle: Don't Restore</strong></h3>



<p>Setting this to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Don't Restore</strong> is vital for maintaining the survival aspect that defines the series. When HP is automatically restored, the tension during dungeon exploration completely vanishes, as every individual battle exists in a vacuum.</p>



<p>By keeping this setting <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">OFF</strong>, you preserve the classic resource-management loop of the series which forces you to make choices in regards to items and spending MPs to heal your party or save them for other skills.</p>



<h3 id="h-bonus-setting-objective-marker-display-off">Bonus Setting -  Objective Marker Display: Off</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Objective-Marker-Off-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Turn off the Objective Marker Display to preserve the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined great sense of discovery</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The beauty of every <em>Dragon Quest</em> title is the sense of <strong>discovery</strong>. This is even more vital in <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong>, where the core of the experience is witnessing how the world’s islands have changed between the <em>Past</em> and the <em>Present</em>.</p>



<p>Having the marker constantly active conditions your experience, making it feell like it’s on rails. By turning the marker off (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Main Menu</strong>, then <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">System</strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Screen Settings</strong>,) you are encouraged to look around the world map and villages and interact with NPCs, who not only provide the clues you need to progress but also flesh out the world with flavor text and lore. This organic exploration makes the game world feel alive, ultimately making your journey far more enjoyable than simply following an icon on a map.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-results">The Results</h3>



<p>By combining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Strong</strong> monsters with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">More</strong> gold, you create a game that is tactically demanding but allows you the resources to meet those challenges. It’s the perfect "Sweet Spot" for your first journey into this beautiful world.</p>

			<p>Although it streamlines many of its most challenging elements to be more welcoming than the PlayStation original, <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> can still be a massive undertaking for newcomers that may have some trouble getting into the game and enjoying it right from the beginning.</p>



<p>To maximize your understanding of the early game, and thus its enjoyment, we have put together a list of beginners' tips that are sure to help you enjoy <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> more, especially if this is your first time putting the fragments of the forgotten past back together again.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-always-talk-to-everyone-and-search-everywhere" data-level="2">Always Talk to Everyone and Search Everywhere!</a></li><li><a href="#h-optimize-combat-pacing-with-fight-wisely" data-level="2">Optimize Combat Pacing with "Fight Wisely"</a></li><li><a href="#h-hunt-for-gold-sparkles-and-vicious-enemies" data-level="2">Hunt for Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies</a></li><li><a href="#h-thoroughly-explore-the-present-day" data-level="2">Thoroughly Explore the "Present Day"</a></li><li><a href="#h-prioritize-defensive-gear-over-offense" data-level="2">Prioritize Defensive Gear Over Offense</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-always-talk-to-everyone-and-search-everywhere">Always Talk to Everyone and Search Everywhere!</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Mini-Medals-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Explore the world thoroughly to discover all sorts of secrets</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Although the experience has been tweaked to be more welcoming,&nbsp;<em><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong></em>&nbsp;is still a&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>&nbsp;game through and through, which puts the same emphasis on exploration as it does on turn-based combat.</span> As such, <strong>every time</strong> you reach a new island or discover a new village, make absolutely sure to talk to every NPC, search every closet and drawer, and smash every urn and barrel before you do anything else.</p>



<p>This isn't just to discover more gear and items that can make you save some gold and <strong>Mini Medals</strong> (which can be exchanged for rewards in <strong>Estard Castle</strong>), but this is also a tip to enhance your enjoyment of the story. </p>



<p>The true beauty of this game lies in the small details and the connection between the past and the present of an island, which the main story often glosses over, giving you a much deeper connection to the world you are working so hard to restore.</p>



<h2 id="h-optimize-combat-pacing-with-fight-wisely">Optimize Combat Pacing with "Fight Wisely"</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Fight-Wisely-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"Fight Wisely" is a great auto-battle option to improve combat pacing</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> addresses the high random encounter rate of older games by making enemies visible on the field, you will still be fighting many enemies during your adventure. To make random battles snappier and considerably faster, consider using the <strong>"Fight Wisely"</strong> Tactics option for all your characters, which you can assign at the start of every battle by pressing the <strong>Triangle / Y / X</strong> buttons.</p>



<p>This auto-combat option is based on the principle of taking down enemies as efficiently as possible. With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Fight Wisely"</strong> on, characters will also heal when needed using either magic or items, making it a much more reliable option than <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Show No Mercy."</strong> During regular combat encounters, however, make sure to <strong>turn off the When Worked Up, Use Let Loose Immediately option</strong> by pressing Triangle / Y / X in the Tactics menu to avoid needlessly wasting the powerful Let Loose skills.</p>



<p>If you wish to speed up battles further, also consider changing the battle speed to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fast</strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra Fast</strong>. While combat animations are great to look at, over the dozens of hours it takes to complete the game, they will grow old, believe me.</p>



<h2 id="h-hunt-for-gold-sparkles-and-vicious-enemies">Hunt for Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Gold-Sparkle-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Focus on Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies if you are not inclined towards exploring the world to still reap some great benefits</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you're a player who's more inclined towards quick story progression, you may want to reduce your exploration endeavors to just hunting down two specific things: <strong>Gold Sparkles</strong> and elite <strong>"Vicious"</strong> enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gold Sparkles:</strong> As opposed to regular sparkles, these found on the world map hide special items and <strong>won't respawn</strong>. Hidden in them are rare items such as <strong>Seeds</strong> that can be used to boost your characters' stats permanently.</li>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Present-Day-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Exploring the Present Day world carefully is really important in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It is a common mistake for players to assume that the "Past" versions of islands are the only places where progress happens. However, you should make it a priority to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">explore everything in the Present Day</strong> as soon as an island has been restored. Many vital <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Fragments</strong> are tucked away in the modern versions of towns and dungeons.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can find <strong>useful gear</strong> and <strong>learn more about an island's history by speaking with NPCs</strong> when you revisit a location. In my first playthrough, I found that if I ever felt stuck or unable to progress at the Shrine of Mystery, the solution was almost always a missed fragment hidden in the most recently restored "Present" island.</p>



<h2 id="h-prioritize-defensive-gear-over-offense">Prioritize Defensive Gear Over Offense</h2>

<p>When visiting a new shop in any of the game's villages and towns, you might be inclined to spend all your gold on the weapon with the highest attack stat. However, I highly recommend that you <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">prioritize purchasing defensive gear first.</strong> In <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong>, especially at <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/">high difficulty</a></strong>, survivability is far more valuable than raw power.</p>



<p>The reason for this is simple: every now and then, you will encounter powerful enemies and bosses that can <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">act twice per turn.</strong> A character with a high-damage sword but weak armor can be wiped out in a single turn before your healer even has a chance to react. By focusing on shields, helmets, and armor first, you ensure your party can weather these difficulty spikes. This strategy is crucial for maintaining the game’s pacing and preventing lost progress.</p>
