			<p>Following the launch of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/"><em>Steam Deck</em></a></strong> a few years back, which effectively created a brand new market for handheld gaming devices, <strong>Valve</strong> will <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">launch the <em>Steam Machine</em> this year</a></strong> to further bridge the gap between gaming <strong>PCs</strong> and consoles in the living room.</p>

<p>Speaking with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve">Game</a></em></strong><strong><em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve"> </a></em></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve">Developer</a></em></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Valve</strong> designer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lawrence Yang</strong> revealed that developers can expect <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"fewer constraints"</em> for receiving a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine Verified</em></strong> badge for their games than <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Deck Verification</em></strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"One easy rule of thumb is that if your title is Verified on Steam Deck, it will be Verified on Steam Machine,"</em> Yang said.</p>



<p>On the other hand, developers looking for a Steam Frame Verified badge may have to face a stricter verification process, although <strong>Valve</strong> will <em>"be going through the same rounds of testing and providing developer feedback,"</em> <strong>Yang</strong> specified.</p>



<p>The <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It Just Works"</em> philosophy behind the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine</em></strong> has also been extended to another new piece of hardware launching this year, the new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Controller Puck,</em></strong> which can charge and pair a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam controller</em></strong> to any <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC</strong>.

<p><strong>A More Accessible Steam Machine Verified Badge Shouldn't Surprise Anyone</strong></p>



<p>Although <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Valve's</strong>&nbsp;setting of more relaxed conditions for a&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine Verified</strong></em>&nbsp;badge may be fueled by understandable marketing reasons, there are likely other reasons why game developers will have an easier time demonstrating that</span> their games are fully compatible with the upcoming systems</p>



<p>The system's specifications <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">meet the recommended requirements of most current games, enabling solid&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1080p</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1440p</strong>&nbsp;resolution gaming. They also roughly match</span> the most common hardware used by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam</em></strong> users as of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">December 2025 Steam Hardware Survey</em></strong>, set to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/"><strong>better or equal performance than 70% of gaming PCs</strong></a>, with only the system's GPU slightly lagging behind the most common choice, the RTX 3060.</p>



<p>As developers likely won't have <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">to optimize their games specifically for the Steam Machine as they have to for the now-dated&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Deck</strong></em>&nbsp;hardware</span>, it stands to reason it will just be easier for developers to get a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Steam Machine Verified</em></strong> badge if their games don't have massively high hardware requirements and have no trouble running on SteamOS.</p>

			<p><strong>Hytale</strong>, the <strong>Minecraft-like MMO</strong> that was recently revived by its original creator (who <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the rights back from Riot Games</a></strong>), is now <strong>finally out in early access</strong>. The game can be purchased <a href="https://store.hytale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the official website</a> (not <strong>Steam</strong>, although Hypixel said Hytale could launch on Valve's platform at a later date) with three options available to customers:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Standard - $24.39</strong>, includes the Voyager, Savanna, and Forest Guardian cosmetic sets (with the Forest Guardian Cape)</li>



<li><strong>Supporter - $42.69</strong>, includes all the above plus the Featherbound, Scavenger, and Arctic Scout sets, each with their capes, as well as the Knight Cape and Explorer Goggles.</li>



<li><strong>Cursebreaker - $85.39</strong>, includes all the above plus 4 additional cosmetic sets (Hope of Gaia, Void Hero, Pop Star, Voidbearer) and 2 additional exclusive capes (Royal Emmissary, New Beginning).</li>
</ul>



<p>Without the open data that would have been available via Steam, it's hard to say how the launch is going. There was a rumor that <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, the game's creator, had shared that over 2.8 million users were in the game, but that rumor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qc1q18/comment/nzi3dj9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has since been largely disproven</a>, on account of anyone being able to join servers with any name when the game launched (this issue has already been patched). Still, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011179217329795221">via his official X account</a>, Collins-Laflamme did share that the Hypixel team was seeing a 'VERY HIGH rate of new Hytale players', which temporarily caused login issues that should now be resolved. Furthermore, just two days ago, he had noted that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-saved-says-hypixel-founder-studios-dev-costs-next-two-years-funded-by-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio's next two years of work had already been funded based merely on pre-order sales</a></strong>.</p>



<p>In just eight weeks, the development team took a build that was over four years old, merged hundreds of branches, and fixed core systems (camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, audio, and rendering), while also squashing thousands of bugs. Even so, Hypixel warns that this is a true early access release: unpolished and still lacking a lot of stuff. What's in the game, anyway?</p>



<p><strong>Exploration Mode</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>An infinite, procedurally generated world with beautiful biomes, ancient structures, friendly creatures, and dangerous monsters</li>



<li>Explore, build a home, grow crops, craft items and equipment, play with friends</li>



<li>Discover the Forgotten Temple and uncover the first elements of the&nbsp;<strong>Cursebreaker story arc</strong>&nbsp;(to unfold in future updates)</li>



<li><strong>Mantling feature</strong>&nbsp;for greater freedom and control in navigating the world</li>



<li><strong>Unified progression and crafting system</strong>&nbsp;with expandable inventories, upgradable workbenches that interact with storage, and specialized crafting stations for hundreds of block and decoration types</li>



<li><strong>Ancient Gateway</strong>: Craft and place at your home to venture into temporary worlds called&nbsp;<strong>Fragments of Orbis</strong>&nbsp;(eventually offering timed adventures from low-intensity exploration to difficult combat and loot extraction)</li>



<li><strong>Memories system</strong>: Collect memories by exploring and interacting with creatures and factions, then return them to The Heart of Orbis for permanent world rewards and upgrades</li>



<li><strong>High mobility combat</strong>&nbsp;with diverse weapons featuring unique abilities</li>



<li><strong>Farming system</strong>&nbsp;with various crops and plants convertible into food and potions</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Creative Mode</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>In-game and standalone tools for building and creativity</li>



<li>Features include block rotation, previews, and connected block textures</li>



<li>Specialized entity tools for creators</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Modding Support (Day 1)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Extensive modding capabilities with asset pack management, assets editor, worldgen editors</li>



<li>Partnerships with Blockbench and CurseForge for Day 1 modding support</li>



<li>Tools for big projects and long-term content creation</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of that, Hytale already offers multiplayer support in all modes. As for what's next, the upcoming Adventure Mode will introduce rich story and narrative elements, deeper progression systems, dungeons with boss fights, and more. Hypixel will also soon start working on the official Minigames, and more social features, such as friends lists and guilds, are on the way. Lastly, the World Gen V2, featuring the complete, restored world of Orbis, is also a long-term goal.</p>



<p>Hytale will eventually launch on consoles as well, while Hypixel is still evaluating the feasibility of a mobile version. Did you jump into this nifty blocky game world yet? Let us know in the comments.</p>
