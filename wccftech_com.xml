			<p>Vancouver-based game developer <strong>The Coalition</strong> is working hard (<a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the help of Polish developer People Can Fly</a>) to complete <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, its first new game since 2019's Gears 5, for the planned 2026 launch. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to the public during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024, but the studio has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-has-been-in-active-development-for-over-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actively on it for nearly six years at this point</a>. </p>



<p>Granted, the team also had other projects, such as supporting Splash Damage on Gears Tactics, 343 Industries on Halo Infinite, and Epic Games on The Matrix Awakens and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-the-coalition-unreal-engine-5-xbox-series-x-alpha-point-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alpha Point Unreal Engine 5 demo</a>. This year, The Coalition launched Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the first installment in the third-person shooter series and the first franchise entry to launch on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles.</p>



<p>But it's with Gears of War: E-Day that The Coalition truly aims to make an impact. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to the Xbox Wire blog</a> as part of a larger end-of-the-year interview with developers from the Xbox, Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard King divisions, they stated:</p>



<p><em>Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Gears of War, and we can’t think of a bigger way to celebrate than with the release of Gears of War: E-Day. This is our most ambitious game yet, entirely built from scratch in Unreal Engine 5 to feel like Gears and play like new. This is a return to our roots as Marcus &amp; Dom face the Locust for the first time ever. It’s the best place to jump into the Gears universe and we can’t wait to share more next year.</em></p>



<p>It is unclear what metric they are considering for this particular claim. We know that E-Day will be more linear than Gears 5, which included open-ended exploration areas and some side content, so they are unlikely to be referring to scope. Perhaps it's merely a reference to an increased budget. </p>



<p>Anyway, Gears of War: E-Day will be an origin story set fourteen years before the first Gears game, on Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde first emerged from its underground tunnels to overwhelm the surface world of the planet Sera. Despite Gears of War: Reloaded's launch on PlayStation 5, E-Day is currently only announced for PC and Xbox Series S and X.</p>
