			<p>Amidst all the craze of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, PlayStation has slipped in the news that the PS5 and PS5 Pro are going up in price in the US starting tomorrow, August 21, 2025, following price increases in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">Canada</a> three years ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">in Europe and the UK and other regions in the world this past April</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the price of the consoles is going up $50 across the board.</p>



<ul>
<li>PS5 (with disc drive) - was $499.99, will be <strong>$549.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 (without disc drive) - was $449.99, will be <strong>$499.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 Pro - was $699.99, will be <strong>$749.99</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, confirmed this past May that the company was looking at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">price increase in the US as part of Sony and PlayStation's response to US tariffs</a>, and today that increase was revealed, though Sony doesn't come out and directly blame the increase on tariffs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the vice president of global marketing at Sony, Isabelle Tomatis, writes that the increase is happening as a result of Sony's journey to "<em>continue to navigate a challenging economic environment.</em>"</p>



<p>Pricing around official PlayStation accessories "<em>remain unchanged</em>" for now, and it seems like, at least for the near future, PlayStation fans around the globe don't have to worry about price increases in their regions, as Tomatis writes, "<em>we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em>"</p>
