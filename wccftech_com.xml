			<p>Earlier this week, tech insider website The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella faced a difficult choice in 2021 regarding the Xbox business. He could either wind down the whole thing or double down by making massive investments, such as the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (following that of Bethesda's parent company, ZeniMax).</p>
<p>He obviously chose the latter option. However, The Information makes the case that the gaming business is failing to keep up with Microsoft's growth plans despite these investments, starting with the fact that they didn't even come close to reaching the 11% target necessary to trigger Nadella's bonus, since growth stopped at 5.8%. It was the only division that fell short of reaching the bonus threshold for the Microsoft CEO.</p>
<p>The Information also shared a few comments on the situation gathered from investors and analysts. Denny Fish, a Janus Henderson Investors portfolio manager whose clients own over $800 million in Microsoft stock, said that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard has been disappointing so far.</p>
<p><em>It’s also a business that had some degree of consistency over, like, a three- to five-year period but was highly volatile from year to year, because you’re so dependent on the big releases like Call of Duty.</em></p>
<p>Truthfully, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did very well this year</a>, though the jury is still out on whether its day-one inclusion on Game Pass was beneficial from a financial standpoint. Despite the boasting about record numbers, Microsoft did not reveal any updated figures for Game Pass subscriptions. The last official number we have is February 2024's 34 million subscribers. As a reminder, the original plan before the Activision buyout was to reach 100 million active subscribers by 2030.</p>
<p>This was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Pachter's prediction</a> for when the Activision titles would be added to Game Pass. Most of them are there now, though, and clearly, the numbers aren't anywhere near that lofty figure. Pachter still sounds confident in the plan, anyway. Here's what he told The Information:</p>
<p><em>Seventy billion dollars is not a pittance—it’s a lot of cash. They might lose money in the short term, which is fine, as long as they can prove that in the long run Game Pass is a solid source of recurring revenue.</em></p>
<p>Another investment manager, Gus Zinn from Macquarie Science and Technology Fund, has a different view:</p>
<p><em>I just think the majority of the game market doesn’t really want a Game Pass.</em></p>
<p>There are highly conflicting views on Microsoft's game subscription service. Some developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-sales-higher-rockfish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absolutely swear by it</a>, while others are skeptical, to say the least. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to former GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring</a>, developers can usually expect to lose up to 80% of premium sales on Xbox consoles if their game is on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Anyway, a Microsoft spokesperson has now denied the aforementioned rumor that Satya Nadella could have shut down Xbox a few years back. In a statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-deny-report-regarding-financial-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Insider Gaming</a>, they have noted Microsoft CEO's prior comments about being <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-were-all-in-on-games-xbox-series-sx-are-our-fastest-selling-consoles-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-in on gaming</a>.</p>
<p>On another, not entirely unrelated note, Microsoft has cut some jobs in gaming as well as other divisions (security, devices, experiences), as <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-lays-off-more-staff-in-gaming-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by PC Mag</a>. The cuts are reportedly very small compared to last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive 1900+ layoffs in January</a>.</p>

			<p>A God of War live service game has been in the works at Bluepoint Games for a while, but it has now been confirmed to have been canceled, together with another yet-to-be-revealed project from another studio.</p>
<p>A new report posted on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNzA2ODk1MywiZXhwIjoxNzM3NjczNzUzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUTdFWjJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.OtpjLAX_fLRPjeIhmdZSXLhsiFNDef1RlL6IxoCIQes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> today confirmed that Sony canceled two more games that were part of the unfortunate live service initiative that has seen one failure after another. The two games were the aforementioned God of War live service game by Bluepoint Games and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-bend-studio-next-game-multiplayer-open-world-systems/"> yet-to-be-revealed project</a> from Days Gone developer Bend Studio. The two games, according to a company spokesperson, were canceled following a recent review, but the two studios won't be closed off, as both Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games are <em>"highly accomplished teams"</em> that are valuable members of the PlayStation Studios family. Their next project will be determined together with Sony, the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>It's really unfortunate to learn this way about the mysterious game Bluepoint Games has been working on for a while. Following the release of the excellent Demon's Souls remake, which was one of the best PlayStation 5 launch titles, the studio helped with the development of God of War Ragnarok until 2022. Now, what the studio will work on is unclear, according to the report's author, Jason Schreier. Maybe it really is time for that rumored Bloodborne remake or remaster? Only time will tell, and fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must apparently pray that creator Miyazaki can make time</a>, too.</p>

<p lang="en">PlayStation fans have speculated for years about Bluepoint's new projects since the well-received PS5 remake of Demon's Souls (2020).</p>
<p>I can report that from 2020-2022 they were helping on God of War Ragnarok. Since then they've been on the live-service project that was canceled today. Now, unclear</p>
