			<p>It was recently reported that Apple has <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-recorded-less-than-500000-units-buyers-are-not-using-it/">only sold 500,000 units</a> of the Vision Pro since its launch in February, and it appears that the company is aware of it and exploring ways to enhance sales. A new report claims that the company is expanding the Vision Pro headset use case by potentially partnering with Sony for its VR Gaming Controller support. The partnership has been in the works for several months now, and Sony's VR controllers will be available to users as optional accessories.</p>
<h2>Apple and Sony are working to bring PlayStation VR2 controller support to the Vision Pro</h2>
<p>The news was shared by Mark Gurman in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro">Power On newsletter</a>, stating that Apple will diversify the list of accessories for the Vision Pro by introducing support for Sony's VR controllers. The analyst also noted that Apple's handset supports the PlayStation 5 and Xbox controllers, but they are not optimized for the augmented reality experience. Sony's VR controller, on the other hand, is designed to take advantage of a virtual reality user experience and would go along with Vision Pro's essence.</p>
<p>The PlayStation and Xbox controllers lack the 6DOF or the six degrees of freedom required for precise VR gaming controls. Sony would have to make some changes to its product distribution strategy if it goes ahead with Apple's plans, requiring it to offer the PlayStation VR2 controller separately, as it is currently bundled with the company's headset. Apple could offer the controllers directly though its online stores and its retail outlets.</p>
<p>It brings us to question whether Apple is aiming to market the Vision Pro as a dedicated gaming headset, and while it should head that road, the PlayStation VR2 controller will enhance productivity tasks as well as aid in media editing in visionOS, according to Mark Gurman. However, it will also serve its true purpose as well - gaming on the Vision Pro, which has been a hit or miss at this point. Nonetheless, it will make it easier for users to control and navigate the operating system using the thumb sticks and the directional pad. The finger pinch gesture could be replaced by the trigger button.</p>
<p>At this stage, it remains to be seen if the two companies have sealed the deal, and if so, there are no official statements on when we can expect the company to add support for the controller. Apple is aiming to expand its market for the Vision Pro, and offering support for the PlayStation VR2 controller could allow the device to extend its reach. We will share additional details on the matter, so do stick around.</p>

			<p>Spanish leaker eXtas1s has heard that South of Midnight, the next game in development at Compulsion Games, might be featured at The Game Awards 2024 with a release window announcement for March 2025. The leaker revealed the rumor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5xdIjl9pFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his latest YouTube video</a>, saying that Microsoft will have a lower key presence than previous TGA shows. Still, this announcement should tickle fans.</p>
<p>South of Midnight was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Microsoft's Xbox and Bethesda Showcase in June 2023. Made by the same folks who released Contrast and We Happy Few, it is a third-person action adventure game set in a Gothic fantasy version of the Southern United States inspired by local folk tales. Protagonist Hazel is forced to become a Weaver, a magical mender of broken ties and spirits, after a hurricane strikes her hometown of Prospero. Armed with these new skills, Hazel must confront and subdue dangerous creatures to save her mother, untangle the webs of her own family's shared past, and possibly find her way to a place that feels like home.</p>
<p>Players will use an ancient power to restore creatures and uncover the traumas that consumed them. They can cast weaving magic to battle destructive Haints, explore the diverse regions of the south, and reweave the tears in the Great Tapestry. They'll explore the lush, decaying county of Prospero and its inhabitants while experiencing an artful, stop-motion-like visual style, not to mention haunting storytelling and music inspired by the complex and rich history of the South.</p>
<p>The developers recently said they're mainly focusing on storytelling rather than combat. Also, gamers can expect it to last around twelve hours, which is not a lot compared to most action adventure titles. However, the game will be available on Game Pass, which should make it more appealing for subscribers. South of Midnight is powered by Unreal Engine 4 and will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X. The consoles will run the game at 60 frames per second.</p>
