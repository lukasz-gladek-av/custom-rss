			<p>An image has appeared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mnzovo/steam_paypal_unavailable_update/">Reddit</a> that includes a statement explaining that PayPal is no longer processing Steam purchases in currencies other than the following six: Euros, Canadian Dollars, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollars, or United States Dollars.</p>



<p>The image shows an answer from Steam Support as to why using PayPal in the user's current currency (which is presumably not one of the above six) is unavailable. "<em>In early July 2025</em>," the statement reads, "<em>PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam. This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD, and USD.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future,</em>" the statement continues, "<em>but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this</em>." The statement then concludes by suggesting the user try a different payment method, including adding funds to their Steam wallet.</p>

<p>This is the first official statement from Valve on the issue, though players have been complaining about the problems on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/595154293314559955/">Steam forums since early July</a>, which lines up with the timeline shared by Valve. One user who commented on the forum linked above claims to have made a purchase on Steam through PayPal, not in one of the aforementioned six currencies just three days prior to July 12, 2025. So we at least have some idea as to when this began.</p>



<p>It's unclear as to why PayPal's acquiring banks are blocking any purchases on Valve's platform not in one of six currencies, but the timeline of everything has many speculating that it has something to do with the current issues around <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-prohibiting-content-violetes-banks-rules/">payment processors seemingly putting pressure on Valve to remove certain kinds of games from its platform</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the timing, there's no concrete connection between PayPal's affiliated banks no longer processing purchases on Steam due to the campaign to have certain kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ukie-says-payment-processors-should-have-confidence-in-age-rating-systems/">adult and NSFW content removed from videogame platforms like Steam and Itch.io</a>. </p>
