			<p>We've repeatedly reported that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 was extremely successful. Saber Interactive's long-awaited third-person shooter sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in the first twenty-four hours on the market and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the five-million milestone by the end of November.</p>
<p>It was one of the best-selling games released in 2024, which made it also very profitable for license holder Games Workshop. In their <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/1alE9DriNd0GJq1SYKn3ZY/e14d3ff03635ea919c569f075b25c60a/2024-25_half_year_report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half-year financial report</a> published on Tuesday, they explained:</p>
<p><em>During the period, our licensing partners launched two new video games; Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a third person shooter for PC and console and Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a combat racing game. Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly, we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income. [....] </em></p>
<p><em>Licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by £18.0 million to £30.1 million (at constant currency rates, an increase of £19.3 million to £31.4 million). Royalty income is recognised in line with IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’; ‘guarantee income’ is recognised in full at the inception of the contract where the performance obligations of the contract have been met and additional ‘earned income’ is recognised when it can be reliably measured following reporting by licensees. Earned income was £26.1 million (2023/24: £5.9 million), the increase being mainly from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</em></p>
<p>Games Workshop is very much right about the volatility of such successes. There's been a plethora of Warhammer and Warhammer 40K games in the last decade or so, but no title ever came close to this level of commercial acclaim. It won't be easy at all to find another big hit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saber Interactive plans to expand Space Marine 2 with lots of new content <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-outlines-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> for the rest of 2025.</p>

			<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Nintendo Switch 2 has been officially revealed today with a new trailer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxLUf2kRQRE&amp;t=18s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The short trailer</a>, which can be watched below, uses the original consoles as a basis to show how the hardware will change in its next iteration with a bigger screen, different Joy-Con controllers, and more. Unfortunately, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">previously rumored</a>, the new trailer doesn't provide much information on the games, showing only a seemingly new Mario Kart game that has yet to be officially confirmed, and confirming only that the system will be fully backward compatible with both physical and digital original Switch games. The trailer doesn't even provide a precise release window past the generic 2025 window, but thankfully, it seems we won't be left in the dark for a long time, as a Nintendo Direct focused on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be aired on April 2nd.</p>

<p>Besides providing a better look at the new system in April, Nintendo also confirmed that in select cities around the world, players will be able to get hands-on with the system. These cities include New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Toronto in North America, Paris, London, Milan, Berlin, Madrid, and Amsterdam in Europe, Melbourne in Oceaniakyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Taipei in Asia. Ticket registrations, which require a Nintendo Account, will open tomorrow, January 17th. More information on these hands-on events, including dates for each city, can be found <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide later this year. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
