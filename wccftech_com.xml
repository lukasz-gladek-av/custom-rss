			<p>Liminal Experiences, Inc is a brand-new UGC gaming startup that is dedicated to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to help boost human-centered creativity. It's announced that it has raised $5.8 million to date in seed funding. Some of those who have backed the company are very large names in the games industry, including BITKRAFT Ventures, Riot Games, and OTK Media Group. The investors also include Marc Merrill, Founder of Riot Games.</p>
<p>Liminal is still currently in development and has a planned release for an Alpha in 2026, where it will transform creation into a game, where it will then make it possible for players to create their own RPG-style adventures from ideas, with AI handling all of the difficult parts. The AI tools will allow people to craft their own worlds as they see fit, as well as create their own characters, and even collaborate with friends to make a bigger adventure overall.</p>
<p>"AI in gaming is a sensitive topic, as many developers worry about <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-simpsons-voice-actor-believes-ai-will-replace-his-work/">being replaced</a>, and players grapple with its ethical issues," says Liminal Experiences Founder and CEO, Brendan Mulligan. "Wading into the debate is fraught, so most gaming companies avoid discussing AI while quietly exploring options internally. This leaves the public conversation to startups founded by tourists to the industry to pitch their vision of the future. There's a real need for studios willing to stand for a positive vision of an AI-enabled future, which should come from developers focused on unleashing, not replacing, human creativity."</p>
<p>Liminal will come with some key features to help it stand out from the sea of ongoing AI development tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation through play of 3D episodic adventure stories, no coding needed</li>
<li>Full building, decorating, and character editing systems</li>
<li>Easy quest creation and advanced gameplay editing</li>
<li>AI-powered storytelling assistance and game creation concierge</li>
<li>Seamless creation and sharing of adventures with 1-4 players</li>
</ul>
<p>While the website doesn't have much to offer thus far, there will be the option to sign up to be a <a href="https://liminal.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play tester</a> of the new tool once it releases in Alpha in 2026.</p>
<p>With Liminal, Mulligan believes that this tool will ensure that the future of gaming is kept alive and fresh as players young and old will be able to discover their own creativity and put their stories into something playable for an audience, where creation becomes possible for anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>"A positive vision of the future should recognize the power of AI to ignite the imaginations of players of all ages, letting everyone realize the fantasy of making their own game experiences."</p>

			<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">Wargaming</a> has announced that the original IP Steel Hunters, an upcoming free-to-play mech hero shooter, will be releasing in Early Access on April 2, 2025. This title is set to blend Battle Royale elements with Extraction mechanics and features a player-first philosophy. This Early Access phase will be beneficial to the development of Steel Hunters and will allow the community to get involved and have a say in the development of the game through their feedback. To ensure the community is kept in the loop, the developers will release information and insights as the game nears the Early Access period. To celebrate the Early Access date announcement, a brand-new trailer on the Steel Hunters YouTube channel gives you a tiny glimpse into the heart-pounding action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters - Early Access Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wargaming is the award-winning mind behind World of Tanks and World of Warships and is now trying something a bit out of its usual style of game to bring a new mech hero shooter named Steel Hunters. However, there is no saying how well this game will perform as of yet, especially in an oversaturated market of Battle Royales and hero shooters, such as Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals, and Fortnite, to name a few key competitors.</p>
<p>However, Steel Hunters is set to stand out from the crowd by being a thrilling mech power fantasy where you get to control mechanical giants named Hunters, and take part in non-stop action-packed battles, where there will be a variety of objectives and tasks for you to complete on the battlefield to ensure that you level up and can acquire new gear to improve your mech.</p>
<p>Each Hunter available in the game has its own unique playstyle, ability kits, and progression systems that will provide you with the opportunity to create strategies and tactics that allow you to eliminate the opponent as you all race towards the extraction point.</p>
<p>The roster will consist of characters such as Razorside, Heartbreaker, Fenris, Ursus, Trenchwalker, Prophet and Weaver, all of which have their own unique abilities that can turn them into a powerhouse on the battlefield, where you'll be able to fight it out for glory on battlegrounds such as Crimson Ridge, Maryland Heights and Stonecutter Keep. You'll be battling it out against five other duo teams, and only one will be able to extract from the Hunting Grounds.</p>
<p>Those interested in playing Steel Hunters will be able to do so on April 2, 2025, on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://wargaming.net/en/wgc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wargaming Game Center</a>, depending on your preference.</p>

			<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/">sandbox games</a> that allowed you to manage large areas or populations. Whether it was Theme Hospital or SimCity 2000, a lot of time was spent playing those games. As someone who loves going to museums, big or small, I knew immediately that I had to play this game, and I'm so glad I did. Truly, you can't go wrong with any of the Two Point games, but Two Point Museum excels in areas that other sandbox titles do not. Between their first game and this new title, they have learned what makes a perfectly challenging, comedic, and relaxing experience all in one.</p>
<p>It's always a little bit daunting jumping into a new sandbox game, regardless of whether you've played the previous iterations in the franchise. There's a lot of information to take on board, as well as trying to remember all the different controls and mechanics that you will need to manage throughout. However, compared to previous Two Point games, Two Point Museum definitely feels the most user-friendly, and I didn't find it nearly as anxiety-inducing to actually get stuck in and start playing. The tutorials were thorough and helped explain every mechanic you'd need to manage, with the campaign taking you through everything you needed to know at a reasonable pace without things getting too chaotic from the outset.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_9e6cbc42294ab41d4ebd29f89ec8796220f92293.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While other sandbox games have tutorials and help you work around the basics, the campaign is a thorough tutorial experience that is relatively stress-free. It helps you learn the controls and basics of the game but also provides information on some of the metrics you'll need to keep an eye on. Compared to Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus, this new game feels incredibly accessible to those who are new to the sandbox or simulation genre and helps ease the player in gently rather than being plunged into the deep end. On top of that, even when you get into the deep end of the game, at no point did I feel like I was drowning or wouldn't be able to get myself out of trouble. Compared to games like Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster, which can be devastatingly punishing, Two Point holds your hand just enough to ensure you don't sink completely under.</p>
<p>I initially started my Two Point Museum experience on PC but found that I also enjoyed playing it on the Steam Deck after initially being daunted by the idea of using a controller for this style of game. However, the controller inputs are smoother and feel easier to work with compared to a mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>After playing Two Point Hospital, I didn't know how it would be possible to make the franchise even better. Still, Two Point Museum takes my love for museums and doubles it by adding the ability to create an aquarium with funky-looking fish and go on expeditions. To obtain artifacts, you have to send your Experts on expeditions, where they may get injured along the way. It makes every discovery exciting, as you never know whether you'll get a duplicate or something completely new from the map. However, duplicates don't go to waste, as you can deconstruct them to learn more about the exhibit, making it higher quality and adding perks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_18e9d7278ffdea6575ef296b3eb1e2ee0eed3b28.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, like any Two Point game, you have funny announcements over the intercom, which also helps to bring your attention to when the chopper returns to the helipad. It also notifies you of things that may slip past your attention, such as exhibits needing to be restored or staff members wanting a raise. From seeing Tails and Sonic walking around your museum as staff members to the dry humor that comes through over the intercom, it's a perfectly packaged game. It's incredibly well-polished, and much love and passion went into making this experience.</p>
<p>The expeditions system is a lot of fun to try and complete, especially when it comes to needing certain perks to ensure that you can even go on the expedition. It starts off relatively safe, with minimal risk, but ramps up soon enough, and you have to really put thought into who you want to send out. If they get injured, there is a very high risk that they will ask for a significant raise, or they will just up and leave. This can be a little bit stressful, especially since at this point, the Expert will be decently leveled up. Luckily, it feels that although it can have consequences, they are fixable consequences, and it doesn't feel like a damning punishment if you make a mistake.</p>
<p>The only issue I had with Two Point Museum was the explanation given for placing staff-only doors and other types of doors on partition walls. Partition walls are in the build section and are small ropes or glass half walls to keep members of the public out of areas. It's explained that you can put a door on these for whatever function you need it for. However, the doors aren't actually compatible with the partition walls, and the game actually means that you need to use the Museum Wall to add doors.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_fc3903f36c1c6cc278db1222a6a9f337edcb3ccc.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I loved the colors and styling of Two Point Museum, as it had a degree of vibrancy that the previous games didn't quite have. While the museums are tones of brown and beige, adding in pops of color through info boards and decorations helps to make the museum shine.</p>
<p>Although I now have multiple museums on the go, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer, and I can't wait to see what other weird and wacky exhibits I unearth on my expeditions.</p>
<p>I have yet to play Two Point Museum's sandbox mode, but considering how user-friendly the rest of the game has been, I expect that, if the campaign is any indication, it will be a good experience with building difficulty.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with Two Point Museum has been a dream. It is exactly everything I wanted from a brand-new Two Point game. I can't wait to see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what comes next</a> for this game and the franchise in general.</p>

				<p>I loved every moment of this game, and didn't have a single issue throughout. There were no frame issues, the game was incredibly accessible and easy to dive into, and didn't have that overwhelming factor that a lot of new sandbox games do. It brings in moments of comedy to break up tense moments, and the campaign helps ease you in to the mechanics little by little.</p>
