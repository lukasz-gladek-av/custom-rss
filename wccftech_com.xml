			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI development seems to be proceeding well, so much so that the expectations of the game appearing during this year's edition of the Xbox Games Showcase weren't just speculation, but an educated guess.</p>



<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDr2ZSFIEXk&amp;t=4105s">XB2 podcast</a>, Windows Central's Jez Corden commented on the sixth entry in the series, saying that it is in a "quite playable" state, without providing any additional information, and that the game's current state is the reason why the game could have been expected to be shown at this year's Xbox Games Showcase. Unfortunately, the game's release window remains unknown, as Corden has no idea how far along the game is, as finding sources inside Bethesda is difficult.</p>

<p>While it has been a long time since the release of the fifth entry in the series, fans of the Bethesda series can make the wait for The Elder Scrolls VI more bearable by returning to Cyrondiil with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. The remaster uses Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and the game's original engine for gameplay, offering an experience that is extremely faithful to the original while updating it where needed.
