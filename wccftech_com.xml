			<p>When Red Dead Redemption launched on PC on October 29, the author of the Reality Redemption overhaul mod, BadassBaboon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they would soon port it for this version. The mod was originally made for the Xbox 360 version (<a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-xenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which could run on PC via Xenia</a>) and the Nintendo Switch version of the game. However, the modder encountered an issue running the game on his configuration. In the meantime, other modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> providing texture mods for specific areas, like grass, particles, and the protagonist himself.</p>
<p>Now, though, BadassBaboon has resolved their issue with launching the game (they had to roll back to an earlier version of Windows 11, for some reason), and Reality Redemption for PC can be downloaded here. It's by far the most comprehensive improvement mod for Rockstar's open world masterpiece. Here's a list of its current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase memory pools and improve general performance</li>
<li>Improve reflection quality</li>
<li>Improve draw distance for vegetation</li>
<li>Improve draw distance for the map</li>
<li>Improve particles and particle count</li>
<li>Improve debris variation and count</li>
<li>Improve physics for liquids like water</li>
<li>Improve AI behavior</li>
<li>Improve the game camera to behave more like RDR2</li>
<li>Improve the Euphoria physics</li>
<li>Improve random events spawn and spawn rate</li>
<li>Improve materials and their interactivity</li>
<li>Improve culling</li>
<li>Modify the movement animations for smoother transitions</li>
<li>Improve John Marston textures</li>
<li>Improve game world textures such as trails, roads, grounds, and grass</li>
<li>Fix the nighttime broken fog and other time cycle shortcomings</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see in the video below, the improvement is significant, and that's even with only 2K textures. I spoke to BadassBaboon about trying to push textures to 4K and they said they'll try.</p>

<p>Beyond a potential texture upscale to 4K, there are also several Reality Redemption features that have to be finished or implemented, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve secondary character textures and building textures</li>
<li>Improve tree textures and smaller physics-based props</li>
<li>Improve cloud skyhats</li>
<li>Improve vehicle draw distance</li>
<li>Improve the shadow maps and shadow distance</li>
<li>Improve sky lighting and time cycles</li>
<li>Improve weather and cloud variations and improve the overall weather system</li>
<li>Improve cloud shadows</li>
<li>Add an option to disable rainy weather at Thieves Landing</li>
<li>Fix the moonlight ground overbright issue</li>
<li>Improve rain effects</li>
<li>Figure out why R* didn't implement a proper PostFX system in this game</li>
<li>Increase some memory allocations</li>
<li>Update the game's lore with new dialogue and subtitles</li>
<li>Improved weapon and environment sounds</li>
<li>Add new and improved particle and effect textures</li>
</ul>

			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, packing a lot of fixes and improvements that should improve emulation considerably.</p>
<p>As confirmed on the emulator's <a href="https://shadps4.net/index.php/2024/10/31/shadps4-v0-4-0-just-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, version 0.4.0 features plenty of fixes and improvements that enable proper emulation of select titles, such as Gravity Rush Remastered, which previously only worked with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/">workarounds</a>. Among the fixes and improvements are shader recompiler fixes, emulated support for CPUs that don't have SSE4.2a, an auto-update feature, swap chain recreation and window resizing, improved keyboard navigation in the game list, working touchpad support, multiple install folders, improved Vulkan support and more.</p>
<p>While there are a few PlayStation 4 exclusives that the ShadPS4 emulator has made playable on PC, such as the aforementioned Gravity Rush Remastered, most players have been keeping an eye on the best PlayStation 4 emulator currently available to see how well it can run Bloodborne. Thanks to the emulator development team and many modders, the game developed by FromSoftware can be played on PC with a variety of improvements and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-loading-speeds-shad-ps4/">blazing fast load speeds</a>, and players will soon be able to enjoy better visuals thanks to an <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-visuals/">unofficial remaster</a> that is currently in the works which will offer something more beyond the higher resolution and 60FPS gameplay made possible by the emulator.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is setting out to be an extremely demanding game on PC, as even recent mid-range GPUs struggle to run the game at the most common resolution.</p>
<p>As highlighted by a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, the game's open beta, which is finally live on all platforms, struggles to run at 60 FPS at native 1080p resolution on an RTX 4070 GPU at the highest settings, often dipping in the 50s and 40s range on the field. With NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation, things obviously fare much better, as the open beta runs at higher than 60 FPS at both 1440p and 1080p resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds | RTX 4070 4K, 1440p, 1080p DLSS 3.7 Frame Generation | PC Performance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFgPHa8C6-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While there's still some time left until release, and things could change in the final release, it's somewhat worrying to see the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta struggle to run at 60 FPS at native 1080p resolution on a mid-range GPU, although that was somewhat expected, given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-out-now-ssd-required-directstorage-supported-frame-generation-listed-as-recommended/">system requirements</a> and Frame Generation being recommended to hit 60 FPS. Hopefully, the Japanese developer will use the next few months to improve things and make the run better on a wider range of system configurations.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game.1024980/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched only a few hours ago,&nbsp;<span>but in this short timeframe, the game has already managed to break some Steam records. Firstly, it has&nbsp;<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1845910/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a concurrent player peak record for a BioWare game with 70.</span>K players. The previous best was Mass Effect Legendary Edition, which launched in May 2021 and included the full remastered trilogy of the sci-fi franchise; its Steam peak was 59.8K concurrent players.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that for several years, EA did not release its games on Steam to favor its own store and app (first Origin, then EA app). For example, Anthem was never launched on Steam, as EA only <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-is-back-on-steam-with-ea-games-and-ea-access-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverted</a> this policy several months after the third-person cooperative shooter launched. By that time, the game had already failed.</p>
<p>While Anthem quickly faded, it did attract considerable interest at first due to the hype. For example, it topped PS4's digital chart for that month. It is reasonable to assume it could have achieved bigger numbers on Steam had it been released right away on Valve's platform.</p>
<p>Still, even with those caveats, Dragon Age: The Veilguard also became the single player game with the highest concurrent player peak published by Electronic Arts, beating Respawn's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which stopped at 67.8K players. There's another little caveat here: The Sims 4 is also a single player title, and it peaked at 96.3K players on Steam, but it is a free-to-play game.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard could still surpass The Sims 4 wholesale during the weekend, when concurrent player records are usually established. Anyway, user reception also appears to be largely favorable, with 79% of the 3,610 user reviews already submitted rating it positively.</p>
<p>Granted, we'll have to wait a bit longer to see a larger picture of the game's sales. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> confidence in the game's breakout potential.</p>
<p>In my review of the game, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPG with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
