			<p>Square Enix is the latest video game publisher to push for AI usage in video game development, aiming to let it handle a critical part of development almost completely by 2027.</p>



<p>As part of the company's latest earnings report, the Japanese publisher shared a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Progress Report on its Medium-Term Business Plan</a>, detailing some of the initiatives underway to boost long-term growth, which include promoting AI utilization in Japan. This is being achieved through the initiation of joint research with the Matsu Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes using AI technology.</p>



<p>The current goal of this joint research project is to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027. This will <em>"improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development"</em>, Square Enix detailed in the report. As of now, the research team is composed of more than 10 people, including researchers from the Matsu-Iwasawa Laboratory and engineers from Square Enix.</p>



<p>While Square Enix has only started researching AI usage in QA, other publishers are already using it for their titles, putting testers' jobs at risk. Last month, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">EA has already been using AI in QA for a while</a>, as a former employee at Respawn confirmed that over 100 people were laid off last Spring because the company started using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, which was work previously handled by human employees.</p>



<p>Square Enix's plans to utilize AI to enhance game development efficiency appear to align with a prevailing sentiment among the most successful Japanese video game developers, such as Masahiro Sakurai and Hideo Kojima. Both developers are not averse to using AI to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">make large-scale game development sustainable</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">let it handle tedious tasks to allow them to focus on the creative process.</a></p>

			<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A has been out for three weeks at the time of this writing, and has had a stunning commercial start with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">5.8 million copies sold in its first week</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-massive-retail-launch-in-the-us/">strong sales in both the UK and the US</a>. Continuing the momentum, today, The Pokémon Company announced that the game's first paid DLC, Mega Dimension, will arrive on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 devices this coming December 10, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came with two new trailers, one that's more of a cinematic showcase of the new DLC, and another that goes into more detail about Mega Dimension and lays out what to expect in the paid expansion.</p>

<p>As shown in the cinematic trailer above, Mega Dimension marks a historic change for the Pokémon series, which is that the level cap for Pokémon, which has been at level 100 for the entire history of the series, has been removed, and you'll now have to face Pokémon far, far stronger than level 100.</p>



<p>The DLC begins with the introduction of a new character, Ansha and her partner Pokémon, Hoopa. They pull you into a new dimension and a new version of Lumiose City that has new versions of Pokémon running around the city, but you're not just there to capture new Pokémon. You're also there to uncover a mystery behind distortions that are appearing across Lumiose City, with the help of Ansha and Hoopa.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Wccftech's review of Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, our reviewer Nathan Birch gave it an 8.5/10, and<em> </em>wrote, "<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em>"</p>
