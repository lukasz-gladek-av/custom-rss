			<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest beat-em-up game from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tmnt-shredders-revenge-the-reason-online-netcode-is-important/">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a> developer, Tribute Games, and publisher Dotemu, finally has a release date after its reveal at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest </a>earlier this year. It'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on December 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The news came with a new release date trailer showing off more of Tribute Games' pixel art and the classic gameplay beat-em-up fans love, while also showcasing some of the 15 playable heroes that'll be in the game when it arrives.</p>



<p>Specifically, the trailer revealed Phoenix and Iron Man as playable characters joining the roster. The rest of the playable characters include Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Captain America, Phyla-Vell, Venom, Nova, She-Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Black Panther, and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a classic beat-em-up style game with a few unique twists, including Tribute Games' Cosmic Swap system, where you'll switch between two characters while playing to address whatever the situation in front of you calls for, making use of one character's abilities over another when they're better suited for the fight.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of upgrades to use, and with the roster of 15 characters, plenty of ways to mix-and-match characters to suit your own playstyle. </p>



<p>Tribute Games has made a name for itself as the studio to follow if you like good beat-em-up games, and there's no sign that this will be anything less than the quality the studio has already delivered with previous titles, specifically TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.</p>

			<p>Major news is brewing for Bandai Namco's JRPG series, Tales, confirming several new projects and providing updates on its next mainline entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-tales-series-remasters-are-on-the-way">More Tales Series Remasters Are On The Way</h2>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/92001">Ryokutya2089</a>, ahead of the launch of Tales of Xillia Remastered, which will launch on October 30 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch, series producer Yusuke Tomizawa spoke with Famitsu about the series' future, starting with the future of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-series-remasters-consistently/">Remaster Project.</a></p>



<p>According to the producer, two titles are in development as part of the project, ranging from verification to the final stages of development. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to know which entry in the series will get remastered next, as it will be revealed fairly soon.</p>



<p>In addition, Tomizawa-san confirmed to Famitsu that the Tales of Xillia 2 remaster is still in development. More information on the project will be revealed as soon as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-new-entry-in-the-tales-series-is-still-away-from-reveal">The New Entry in the Tales series Is Still Away From Reveal</h2>



<p>Besides commenting on future series remasters, Tomizawa-san also briefly touched upon the next main entry in the series. This new game is still under development, but it will be a while before it's announced. </p>



<p>Compared to past console generations, where multiple entries in the series were announced and then released in Japan close to one another, this is a radically different approach. Hopefully, the long wait since <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">Tales of Arise</a>, which launched back in 2021, will be worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-of-the-series-audience-is-in-the-west">Most of the Series' Audience is in the West</h2>



<p>One interesting tidbit of information shared with Famitsu by Tomizawa-san is that most of the Tales series audience is in the West, over 70%. This is rather surprising, considering how the series was long neglected in North America and Europe with late releases and games that never made the jump.</p>



<p>Among these Japan-exclusive games are the 2D games Tales of Destiny remake and Tales of Rebirth, which are among the best entries in the series. Could either of these games be one of the remasters currently in the works?</p>



<p>Thankfully, those willing to go <span>the extra mile to play any of the Tales games that weren't released in the West via emulation have the chance to experience them in English. L</span>ast year, Life Bottle Productions released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch-download/">Tales of Rebirth English translation patch</a>&nbsp;that also adds new features such as subtitles for animated movies, battle subtitles, and more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-tops-the-us-sales-charts-for-september-2025-and-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima%E2%80%99s-covid-era-numbers.1331734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Circana analyst and senior director Mat Piscatella has reported the latest sales charts for video game sales in the United States for the month of September 2025, and it's a sports-games-focused top five with a mix of shooting and some sword slashing, as Borderlands 4 lands in the number one spot, Ghost of Yotei cracks the top five at the number four spot, and the latest annualized sports titles making up the rest of the top five.</p>



<p>As Piscatella does each month, he shared the charts for the best-selling premium games of the previous month and how they factor into the best-selling premium games of 2025 so far in the US. With Borderlands 3 shooting to the top of the sales charts for the month of September 2025, it also did well enough to become the third-best-selling premium game in the US in 2025 so far with Monster Hunter Wilds in second and NBA 2K26 in first ahead of it.</p>



<p>NBA 2K26, for its part, was one of the annualized sports games that filled out the rest of the top five best-selling premium games for September. It landed just behind Borderlands 4 in the number two spot, while EA Sports FC 26 came in at number three, followed by Ghost of Yotei, with Madden NFL 26 rounding out the top five in fifth.</p>







<p>Even though Ghost of Yotei didn't make the top three for best-selling premium games, it's worth noting that it made the top five even without being in players' hands, since it officially launched on October 2. Piscatella also points out that Yotei's numbers were "<em>flat</em>" in comparison to Ghost of Tsushima. </p>



<p>That might not sound like a positive takeaway, but when you remember that at the time of Tsushima's launch on July 17, 2020, much of the world was under COVID-19 lockdowns, with the video game industry enjoying a massive boom with everyone spending all their time inside, many not fully back to work as companies across the globe adjusted to the pandemic, it's clearly a sign of how strong Yotei's performance was.</p>







<p>Ghost of Yotei also cracked the charts for the best-selling premium games in the US for 2025 so far at number 18. Overall, for a console-exclusive title, there's no denying that Ghost of Yotei is off to a strong sales start.</p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the Nintendo Switch 2 was once again the best-selling console of the month in the US, followed by the PlayStation 5. The PS5 also hit a milestone in September, as it officially surpassed the lifetime install base of the PlayStation 3.</p>



<p>Overall, September was a strong sales month for the video game industry in the US, as Piscatella reports the total spend across hardware, software, and accessories grew 10% compared to last year. It'll be interesting to see how October's charts line up, with Yotei having a full month on shelves and the arrival of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>For more on Ghost of Yotei, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">check out our full review</a> where Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo gave it an 8.8/10, saying, "<em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo</em>."</p>
