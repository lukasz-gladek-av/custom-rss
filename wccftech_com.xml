			<p>This morning, game developer and publisher KRAFTON <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a studio leadership change for Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds, one of its subsidiaries. KRAFTON had <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">announced</a> the acquisition of Unknown Worlds in October 2021 for an undisclosed sum. There were no changes right away. Now, though, the original founders of Unknown Worlds (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) will be replaced by Steve Papoutsis, former Visceral Games executive and co-creator of Dead Space. Interestingly, Papoutsis was previously the CEO of Striking Distance Studios, another studio owned by KRAFTON (they made The Callisto Protocol).</p>



<p>CH Kim, CEO of KRAFTON, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>There is nothing more important than the gamer experience. Given the anticipation around&nbsp;Subnautica 2, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible. We are thrilled Steve is joining us in our shared commitment at KRAFTON and Unknown Worlds to deliver&nbsp;Subnautica 2&nbsp;as a more complete and satisfying entry in the series—one that truly lives up to player expectations.</em> <em>KRAFTON puts players at the heart of every decision because they deserve the absolute best. We understand how eager our community is to dive into the underwater world of&nbsp;Subnautica 2, and we are working diligently to deliver an experience that meets those expectations—while maintaining our unwavering commitment to quality and player experience. We deeply appreciate the patience and trust of our Subnauts, and we are doing everything possible to ensure the final result is worth the wait.</em></p>



<p>Steve Papoutsis, the new CEO of Unknown Worlds, added:</p>



<p><em>I am thrilled to be taking on this new role within the KRAFTON family and to be working alongside the immensely talented team at Unknown Worlds. Player experience is our North Star, and the team is laser-focused on delivering the best possible game for the&nbsp;Subnautica&nbsp;community. We appreciate Ted, Charlie, and Max for their past roles in having built this beloved world, and thank the fans for your devotion and patience.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-launches-next-year-in-early-access-on-pc-and-xbox-will-also-be-on-game-pass/">Subnautica 2</a> is scheduled to launch later this year in early access on PC and Xbox Series S|X. It will also be available via Game Pass.</p>
