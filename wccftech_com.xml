			<p>Today, Rockstar Games announced the acquisition of Sydney-based developer Video Games Deluxe. The studio was founded in 2013 by former Team Bondi founder Brendan McNamara. Since its inception, Video Games Deluxe has collaborated with Rockstar on the re-release of L.A. Noire and the 2017 VR-only game L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files. More recently, the developer has worked on improving Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games Head of Publishing Jennifer Kolbe said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After working together closely over many years, we are excited to have Video Games Deluxe join the team as Rockstar Australia.</em></p>
<p>Video Games Deluxe founder Brendan McNamara added:</p>
<p><em>It’s been an honor to work closely with Rockstar Games this past decade. We are thrilled to be a part of Rockstar Games and to continue our efforts to make the best games possible.</em></p>
<p>The acquisition price remains undisclosed. In July 2020, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/l-a-noire-creators-working-on-aaa-open-world-vr-game-for-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for an open world VR game to be made for Rockstar. However, given the complete lack of growth for virtual reality gaming, it is highly unlikely that the project is still being worked on. It is far more conceivable that the former Video Games Deluxe will bolster Rockstar's output with the upcoming massively anticipated launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, planned for this Fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-awaited free Grand Theft Auto V update</a> that's set to introduce technical improvements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>AMD FSR1 and FSR 3</li>
<li>Ray traced shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, and global illumination</li>
<li>Faster loading times using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices and configurations</li>
<li>Enhanced support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher frame rates</li>
<li>DualSense controller support, with adaptive triggers</li>
<li>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
</ul>
<p>The patch will drop tomorrow and can already be preloaded on PC.</p>

			<p>While the word hunt immediately brings death to your target in mind, hunts in Monster Hunter Wilds don't always have to end with the actual demise of your target monsters. On the contrary, there are some good reasons not to kill any of the giant monsters you will meet on your journey in the Forbidden Lands.</p>
<p>Capturing monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds is quite simple, but you will need a few items, which must be used at the right time. These items are <strong>Pitfall or Shock Traps</strong>, and items that can put the monster to sleep once they have fallen into one of the traps, like <strong>Tranq Bombs</strong>, <strong>Tranq Blades</strong>, which can be used as Slinger ammo or <strong>Tranq Ammo</strong>, which is only used with the Bowguns.</p>

<p>The right time to use the items above to capture a monster in Monster Hunter Wilds is when it has been <strong>weakened enough</strong>. You will know a monster is weak enough to be captured when <strong>it starts limping, if its heartbeat is going flat, or if you see a small skull icon on top of the monster's icon on the minimap</strong>. Once you have assured the monster is weak enough, place <strong>one of the two traps on the ground</strong>, wait for the monster to get <strong>caught in it</strong>, and <strong>use any of the Tranq items twice</strong>. Once this is done correctly, the monster will be captured, and your current hunt will be completed successfully, even without having actually taken the monster down.</p>
<p>While capturing monsters is a good way to end hunts slightly faster in Monster Hunter Wilds, there's another good reason to do so if you're farming certain items, as ending hunts by capturing monsters<strong> increases the rarity of quest rewards</strong>. At the same time, some monster parts can only be obtained by killing the monster, so depending on the items you are seeking, you should always consider both options to complete hunts.</p>
