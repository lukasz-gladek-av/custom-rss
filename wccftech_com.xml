			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available online introduces plenty of visual improvements to the game developed by Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<p>The new Ultra Plus mod, which was developed by Lazorr and can be downloaded from Nexus Mods, introduces plenty of visual improvements by fixing some visual issues as well as visual settings that can be pushed past those available in the vanilla game. Besides the improvements to Global Illumination, Shadows, Reflections, Shading, View Distance, and Texture Quality, the mod also introduces upscaled 4K resolution prerendered cutscenes, which look amazing. Unfortunately, the modder has released no comparison screenshots, though <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM3">some</a> shared by Nexus Mods users <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM4">show</a> how the mod can bring <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM5">considerable</a> visual <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODQw">improvements.</a></p>
<p>Even in its vanilla state, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game that is more than worth experiencing for all fans of the genre. With its unique twists to classic turn-based combat, a beautiful and unique world, a compelling cast, and a moving, thought-provoking story, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is undoubtedly one of the best RPGs of the current generation, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactiveâ€™s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>Injustice 3 might be on the way, as teased by MultiVersus dataminer MultiVerSusie. In a not-too-cryptic X post, they <a href="https://x.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1923533288137724173%7Ctwgr%5Ecad582adc9b8e13dcbc918ed0b0eb1a538f4db0b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamereactor.eu%2Finjustice-3-is-rumored-to-be-in-development-1545223%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>multiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice</em></p>
<p><em>leaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice</em></p>
<p>And then, just to make it even clearer:</p>
<p><em>3</em></p>
<p>Of course, it's worth taking this rumor with a big grain of salt. Still, it doesn't seem far-fetched at all. The previous Injustice games were big successes for developer NetherRealm Studios and Warner Bros. Games, selling a lot of copies and garnering widespread critical and fan acclaim. By far their most appreciated feature was the story, which featured a gritty, unique take on the DC Universe where Superman falls into darkness after being tricked by the Joker into killing his beloved Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis. Batman leads the resistance against his totalitarian regime.</p>
<p>There's no question that the Injustice games raised the bar for story and presentation in fighting games, but they were also no slouch in the gameplay department. The second game also added new features like the RPG-inspired Gear System that extended its longevity, particularly in the multiplayer modes. Injustice 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/injustice-2-justified/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8.4/10 here on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, Injustice 2 is surprisingly fantastic. Combat feels very weighty and satisfying, the graphics look incredible, characters look fascinatingly detailed and even the bass-heavy sound design is top notch. DC and fighter fans should definitely be giving Injustice 2 time.</em></p>
<p>It's been eight years, though, and fans have only had the mediocre animated 2021 film since. NetherRealm has released two consecutive Mortal Kombat games, so it could well be time to switch back to the DC-branded fighting game, especially since Warner Bros. has mandated a greater emphasis on its DC franchises.</p>
<p>In fact, James Gunn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head of the new interconnected DC Universe</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier this year to have met with both NetherRealm and Rocksteady about new DC games. It might be a while before Injustice 3 is announced, though, based on the DC heads' statements.</p>

			<p>According to insider eXtas1s, Microsoft has internally begun testing Steam integration within the Microsoft Store environment, intending to bring that to the next-generation Xbox console eventually. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZfAx5-EJRs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the latest YouTube podcast</a>:</p>
<p><em>Xbox + Steam are heading into the next generation, but steps are already being taken as Microsoft has just added the Steam application to the support software for its devices, appearing under the name of Steam Developer Beta. This, of course, is currently only available to certain employees and people who collaborate with Microsoft to provide support or develop certain things.</em></p>
<p><em>This is more than just a detail, because it logically reflects Microsoft's intention to facilitate coexistence and cooperation between its Xbox ecosystem and the gigantic PC platform that is Steam today. This integration will allow users to run Steam more smoothly and directly from Windows environments and, in the future, Xbox environments. I've been telling you that the next generation of Xbox is going to be more like a PC than a console. Everything is going to be developed around PC environments. Those logically need Steam integration and you'll have that in your Microsoft Store when you turn on your next generation Xbox console. This will allow you to have Steam on your Xbox console and on any Windows device without the need for complex configurations, which is a key step for the experience of the future console.</em></p>
<p>eXtas1s is not the first insider to talk about this eventuality. Windows Central's Jez Corden predicted the same a while ago, although in this case, eXtas1s claims to have sources indicating that testing for the Steam integration has already begun. As a reminder, the latest rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> that the next-generation console strategy includes a successor to the Xbox Series X paired with a handheld device. Both should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2027, with Microsoft attempting to launch ahead of Sony's PlayStation 6 after skipping the mid-generation console refresh that Sony released with the PS5 Pro.</p>
