			<p>The now-inevitable PC ports, not the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">PlayStation handheld</a>, will likely be why <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-6/">PlayStation 6</a> games may not push the system to its absolute limits.</p>



<p>During a new episode of the Moore's Law is Dead <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO7jZFz97Tg">Broken Silicon podcast</a>, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk commented on the rumored next-gen systems by Sony, making some interesting observations on how the handheld system is unlikely to hold back the home console. First, the developer highlighted how we are in a post-resolution era where a game such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">Street Fighter 6 looks better on Nintendo Switch 2 than on Xbox Series S</a>, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS, even though it runs at a lower resolution on the Nintendo system. By focusing on resolution targets, rather than scaling down visual settings, which most devs apparently find more impactful, scaling down games from their home console version to their handheld version shouldn't be a huge hurdle, especially if the leaked specs are correct and using upscaling tech like PSSR and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4</a>, which is getting better and better rather quickly.</p>



<p>Even if the differences between the home PlayStation 6 and the handheld system end up being bigger than the leaked specs suggest, there likely won't be a repeat of the Xbox Series X and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-series-s/">Xbox Series S</a> situation, mostly due to market share. Considering Sony's current share and what the handheld should be able to achieve in a market that's more than ever favorable for these devices, it won't be too difficult to set the portable PlayStation as the baseline system, something that Microsoft never had the chance to do for the Series S with its market share.</p>



<p>According to Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk, the now inevitable PC ports have a higher chance of holding back PlayStation 6 games. Nowadays, every PlayStation console game is being developed with a PC port that will follow the console release in mind. Having to take into consideration different system configurations, many sporting dated hardware like entry-level GPUs from a few generations back, and storage bottlenecks, developers are unlikely to create a game that pushes a console to its absolute limit if this will eventually lead to issues developing the PC port down the line.  The developer makes the examples of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, a multiplatform port which remade a game that pushed the PlayStation 2 to its limits that doesn't look much better than Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and has a lot of technical issues, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, a current PS5-only game that takes serious advantage of the system and pushes the Decima Engine to its absolute limits. Metroid Prime Remastered is also an example of a console-exclusive game that pushed a console, the Nintendo Switch, to its limits thanks to the fact that no PC port had to be considered. With AMD not having the market share to push the widespread adoption of any new feature it may develop for the next generation of consoles, it is easy to see how having to port games to PC will likely impact how they will take advantage of the new hardware.</p>

<p>Considering how much the video game market has changed in the past few years, it will be fascinating to see how Sony and Microsoft will face the challenges ahead with the PlayStation 6 and Xbox Next. Though nothing is officially known about the two systems, leaks suggest the two companies will tackle these challenges in<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/"> very different ways</a>, which will make the next generation one of the most interesting in a very long time.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/heres-why-battlefield-6-doesnt-have-levolution/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-why-battlefield-6-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-bf4%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98levolution%E2%80%99.1300113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even before DICE and the other teams formally unveiled Battlefield 6, the developers already <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-will-feature-the-most-realistic-and-exciting-destruction-effects-in-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">touted</a> in a job ad that the next entry in the military first-person shooter franchise would feature the 'most realistic and exciting destruction effects in the industry'. </p>



<p>Now that most fans have already played the game in last month's beta weekends and the full game is only a few weeks ahead, though, it's obvious that while Battlefield 6 does feature well-made destruction, it's not quite as thorough and all-encompassing as in some of the previous installments, such as Battlefield 4's 'Levolution', which gave players the opportunity to raze entire buildings. </p>



<p>Speaking to EDGE in the latest issue (415) of the <a href="https://fave.co/4mquqZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magazine</a>, Ripple Effect General Manager Christian Grass explained that the developers have opted to implement 'tactical destruction' in Battlefield 6, as being able to destroy everything during matches could harm the game's fun factor. </p>



<p><em>We love the spectacle of that destruction – it looks awesome, sounds awesome, it’s really cool. But we want it to serve a gameplay purpose. If you could destroy everything, once there’s nothing left, then the game wouldn’t be fun. In Bad Company 2, it was a little bit more ‘what if you could destroy all these freestanding buildings, without anything remaining?’ </em></p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 uses what we now call the apple-coring system, where we make sure that gameplay spaces always have cover, and are always interesting to fight around. We want people to be flanking by destroying things, to take down a building to eliminate an enemy. We have tanks driving into a building, so that you suddenly have this threat in a place you thought you were safe. </em></p>



<p>Even so, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-destruction-improvements-battlefield-2042/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offers better destruction than Battlefield 2042</a>, and it performs better, too. According to the Technical Director of Battlefield 6, this is partly because the developers had to optimize the game for the less powerful Xbox Series S, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the game run better on all platforms</a>. We have also learned that console players <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-secretly-console-first-turn-off-crossplay-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be able to turn off cross-play with PC</a> while maintaining the feature to play between consoles (for example, PlayStation and Xbox users together).</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-now-works-on-steam-deck-delivering-significant-image-quality-improvements.1300110/</guid>

			<p>AMD FSR 4 now works on Steam Deck in select games, delivering noticeable image quality improvements in Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a> provides a step-by-step guide on how to install AMD FSR 4 on Steam Deck and use it in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which both support the upscaler. The installation process is relatively simple, and the small effort seems to be totally worth it, although performance is not the best at the current early stage. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, using AMD FSR 4 over previous versions of the upscaler delivers a cleaner and sharper image, with better detail for elements in the distance, such as buildings. The new version of the upscaler delivers similarly impressive results in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and with a relatively minor impact on performance.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="BREAKING: FSR4 Is Now Working On Steam Deck!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7EHLj8L-VUE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although AMD FSR 4 is officially only supported on RDNA 4 GPUs, workarounds have been discovered to run the upscaler on devices powered by previous architectures like the aforementioned Steam Deck and RDNA 3 GPUs like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-3-gpus-run-fsr-4/">RX 7800</a>. Even without the proper hardware to run the upscaler, it seems like AMD FSR 4 delivers solid results in multiple scenarios, giving owners of older devices the chance to improve the image quality and performance of several titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>



<p>Many of the visual and performance improvements AMD FSR 4 delivers in supported games should make their way to the PlayStation 5 Pro soon with the new version of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler. According to rumors, the new PSSR version should launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">early next year.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've known from the Steam concurrent player figures that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has had a strong launch</a>, despite the performance issues that led Gearbox president and CEO Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share some 'advice' with the community</a>.</p>



<p>2K and Gearbox have stayed silent so far, though. Thankfully, Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> the analyst firm's initial estimates, revealing that Borderlands 4 has already passed two million units sold across all platforms, and one million on Steam alone (750K in the first week), generating over $150 million in revenue. This also means it beat even Hollow Knight: Silksong, at least on Steam, as well as other hot indies like Peak. Despite the launch of a highly anticipated triple-A game like Borderlands 4, the indie games did very well for themselves, with Silksong and Peak at the head of the pack. Even the original Hollow Knight sold another 205K units last week. Lastly, the South Korean cooperative roguelite game Shape of Dreams also sold nearly 200K units, a big success for the two-man indie development team Lizard Smoothie.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Alinea Analytics report also discusses Dying Light: The Beast, which is out tomorrow after being bumped up by one day because <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Techland celebrated the game's one million pre-orders</a>. According to the analyst firm, however, things are a little more nuanced than that. As you might remember, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> started its life as the second Dying Light 2: Stay Human DLC before evolving into its own standalone game. Those who purchased Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition were entitled to two DLCs, so Techland will provide them access to Dying Light: The Beast. Alinea Analytics infers there are about 700-800K of these users, given that the actual Steam pre-orders for the new game are around 100K, and the rest must be pre-orders from consoles.</p>
