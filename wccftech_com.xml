			<p>Ever since FromSoftware's Souls series started rising in popularity, the vast majority of action role-playing games developed by smaller and more established studios have been inspired in some capacity by the Japanese developer's franchise. While many of these games are great experiences on their own, they highlighted how the genre is suffering from some homogenization, where very few are the games that try to break from the mould and offer something different. For this reason, I could not help but appreciate Empyreal's approach to the genre when I first tried it in February. While the game doesn't leave a great impression going from the visuals alone, some of its gameplay mechanics felt unique enough to give the game a very peculiar identity. Even then, however, I felt that there could have been some issues, but I expected elements to come together better once I could experience the game from the very beginning and go through the onboarding process. Unfortunately, experiencing Empyreal from the beginning only made it more evident how these issues result in a game more frustrating to play than fun.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502164603_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Empyreal is set on an unnamed unexplored planet where a colossal structure known as the Monolith has been discovered. As the first Expedition that set foot on the planet quickly realized, this Monolith isn't just something left behind by a lost civilization, but a mysterious place that is still very much alive, filled with powerful automatons and all sorts of dangers that feel geared towards preventing anyone from reaching its deepest recesses. With the Expedition on the brink of complete failure, a gifted mercenary reaches the planet to do what it failed to accomplish, and discover what truly lies inside the Monolith that no man should have ever awakened.</p>
<p>From the premise, it's clear that Empyreal's story is somewhat uninspired. It's not particularly bad, to be honest, but it really doesn't feature anything that makes it remarkable. The characters don't fare much better, as they have a paperthin predictable characterization, going from the grumpy Expedition leader with a bone to pick with anyone that isn't a member of the Expedition itself, the helpful but a little airheaded scientist, the welcoming and mostly helpful quartermaster, the wacky merchant and scrapper-meets-blacksmith and so on. None of them is particularly annoying, to be honest, but they fail to make an impression so much with their limited development and generic design that it is easy even to forget their names. Overall, the story and characters in Empyreal are nothing more than a backdrop to justify the exploration of the Monolith and a way to access some critical services needed to complete the game.</p>
<p>With the story not being particularly involving, nor the characters much endearing, it's clear how developer Silent Games placed greater emphasis on gameplay in Empyreal. During your first trek into the Monolith after creating your character via a character creator featuring a decent selection of options, you will experience a good portion of what Empyreal has to offer: intricate locations with plenty of side paths to explore filled with additional items that can be sold for silver and gear of different rarity and levels, powerful Automaton enemies with varied movesets and configurations that require players to strategize on the fly to deal with the most annoying enemies first before handling everyone else using one of the three weapon types - Glaive, Mace &amp; Shield and the Cannon - and abilities with cooldown mechanics that can be unleashed at will without having to worry about spending resources like AP or MP, and some items coming with both supporting and offensive support. The game generally does a decent job introducing its central mechanics throughout the first few journeys to the Monolith, and though there's a general clunkiness to movement and attacking, it's easy to see the potential, especially with some of the unique defensive mechanics the game features which combine a relatively straightforward parry and perfect dodge mechanic, depending on the weapon, with a charging bar beneath each enemies' names that indicates when their next attack will go off, almost giving some turn-based feel to the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502174257_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After gathering a few Cartograms, blueprints which determine every aspect of every trek into the Monolith, including level, biome, elemental affinity of enemies, loot table, and bosses, and going through stages a couple of times, however, what was only a thought in the back of the mind becomes reality. Empyreal is a game that's more frustrating to play than fun, due to the average execution of its mechanics. The clunky movement and stiff animations are only two of the reasons the game becomes frustrating fast. For starters, there is no lock-on, an interesting choice for a game that wants players to go after specific enemies first due to their supporting capabilities that only makes matters more frustrating, as not only the camera needs constant readjusting to have a good view of the battlefield, but enemies also attack from off-screen without any indicator, with a few exceptions, which makes it very difficult to avoid their attacks. In addition, a good portion of these attacks teleport the Automatons to the player or have insane tracking, so unless your parries and dodges are on point, you will eat a lot of damage quickly. The fact that enemies are not staggered by regular attacks and a good number of abilities unless the bar below their health bar has been filled, leaving them staggered and open to a powerful critical attack, often resulting in your character being defenseless after unleashing them.</p>
<p>All of the above often forces players to use hit and run tactics with the two close-range weapons, or in a costant parry and counterattack playstyle that gets very old fast. In addition, even the parry and dodging mechanics feel clunky, as both are mapped to the same button, which is not ideal. As if all this wasn't enough, there are times when some maneuvers go off for no apparent reason. A few times, I had a ranged counterattack with the Glaive going off for no reason during a boss battle, which essentially teleported me towards an untimely death. Ultimately, things get a little better by using items, but too often I felt I was fighting against the mechanics, rather than against the enemies. Even boss battles are not exempt from this. The contrary. Their tendency to constantly call in minions only adds to the frustration, and what could have been challenging duels become a constant hit-and-run fight that's not very fun.</p>
<p>It's a shame the central combat mechanics are not executed too well, as Empyreal does a few things right that would have made fans of classic ARPGs like the Diablo series quite happy. The gear customization system, for example, is well-developed, allowing players almost from the beginning of the adventure to customize their equipment using specific materials that can enhance attributes at the expense of others, randomly roll properties, and more. With an emphasis on elemental properties, Empyreal also offers different slots in which to save loadouts for quick switching, which ultimately incentivizes going into stages with very different elemental properties. The three weapon types are also quite diverse from one another, and even offer different playstyles in combination with a good selection of abilities obtained by using silver and sometimes items at the blacksmith, which range from purely offensive skills to support skills that also have unique effects by just equipping them. Level design is also varied enough, although things get a little repetitive within a specific biome, which is to be expected, but still, with so many materials to collect, the game does a solid job providing players with a reason to go off the beaten path and to shoot for things other than the final boss of each Cartogram. Even in terms of endgame content, Empyreal gets things right, offering a New Game + mode with an increased level cap for Cartograms, new NPC duels and an epilogue with a new ending.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250502172501_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even if one were to look past some of the issues above and enjoy the best features Empyreal offers, it won't take too long for the gameplay loop to become tiring. Proper multiplayer features may have provided some more incentives to grind, but in this regard, Empyreal doesn't offer much besides some asymmetrical mechanics that allow players to receive gear from other players as a gift, a free immediate respawn during boss battles, and a simple sharing and trading system for items and Cartograms. In conjunction with the frustrating combat, this makes it almost pointless to delve deeper into anything that isn't strictly story-related.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Empyreal doesn't exactly strike a good impression as the Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals are not very good. While some of the biomes inside the Monolith have a distinct look, most of the game's locations aren't particularly good-looking. The worst offender is definitely the main camp, which looks terribly generic and almost lifeless with its flat lighting. The character and enemy models don't fare much better, as they are just as uninspired and dull as the main camp.</p>
<p>Empyreal also leaves something to be desired in terms of performance on PC. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran considerably worse than I expected, given the undemanding visuals it pushes, struggling to run past the 90 FPS average range at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode, no Frame Generation and high settings. A benchmark session held in an area generated in the Monolith's first biome, Man &amp; Church, using a mid-game Cartogram ran at an average of 93 FPS and 16 FPS 1% low, which is way below what a system with those specifications should have delivered in an undemanding game. I did not experience any major stuttering, to be honest, so the experience was definitely playable, but systems with lower specifications than mine may have some trouble running the game properly, even with the supported upscalers, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and UE5's TSR, and frame generation tech, DLSS and FSR.</p>

<p>Empyreal took only around 18 hours to complete, but many of these hours were not particularly enjoyable. While the game has a few things that work well, they are not enough to salvage an experience that could have been something more than the frustrating one that ended up being. With some tweaks to combat and maybe proper multiplayer, the experience crafted by Silent Games has the potential to become something else, so I sincerely hope the studio will have the opportunity to do so, as some of the ideas implemented in the game are definitely solid.</p>

				<p>Empyreal's ambition to do something different is commendable, but it's ultimately the only thing it truly has going for it. While character customization and the Cartogram system are solid enough, the forgettable and generic story and characters, average and clunky combat and the lack of proper multiplayer mechanics make the game a frustrating experience that gets tiring very quickly and one that only the most diehard ARPG fans might briefly appreciate.</p>

			<p>If anyone thought the recent confirmation of a GTA VI delay (the game's launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been moved</a> from Fall 2025 to May 26, 2026) would harm its hype, the first viewership registered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second trailer</a> will make them reconsider.</p>
<p>According to Rockstar Games (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-views-record-1236210396/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Hollywood Reporter</a>), the trailer that suddenly aired two days ago surpassed 475 million views across all platforms in the first twenty-four hours. This makes it the most-viewed trailer of all time, not just among games but across all entertainment, beating the previous record of Deadpool vs. Wolverine, which stopped at 365 million views. The recent trailer for The Fantastic Four: First Steps registered around 200 million views in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>For comparison, the first GTA VI trailer only garnered 93 million views. However, it was a YouTube exclusive, and it still managed to become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most-viewed non-music video of all-time on the platform</a>, second only to a couple of songs from the South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
<p>That trailer also helped bring its featured song (Love Is a Long Road, made by Tom Petty) to the top of the music charts, and the same is true this time around with the new trailer's song, Hot Together by The Pointer Sisters. According to Spotify, the song's popularity grew by 182,000% (not a typo) following the debut of the GTA VI trailer.</p>
<p>Sulinna Ong, Spotify’s global head of editorial, stated:</p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto cuts through popular culture like almost nothing else. Music has been synonymous with the series since the very beginning, so it’s great to see fans both new and established connecting with an iconic track in this way.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday, Rockstar Games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the trailer was captured on Sony's PlayStation 5 hardware with a mix of gameplay and cutscenes. Given how great it looked, that's highly reassuring. PlayStation 5 Pro users may get even better visuals or higher frame rate options.</p>
<p>As for PC, Rockstar hasn't said anything about the platform's launch window yet, but a prominent manufacturer of PC gaming peripherals <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> GTA VI should be released only a few months after the console debut.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-%E2%80%9Cfrom-surviving-to-succeeding%E2%80%9D.1183788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Control 2, the next big single-player game from Remedy, will be made on a smaller budget than its last single-player feature, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a>, chief executive officer Tero Virtala confirmed.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/remedys-next-big-game-is-being-made">Game File,</a> Virtala spoke about how this will be done, and how it's about Remedy learning from past mistakes to go "<em>from surviving to succeeding</em>."</p>
<p>Virtala says that €50 million is what he thinks the studio needs to make a good Remedy game, and that's the budget Control 2 has, which is slightly less than what Alan Wake 2 cost to make. Remedy has always been known for creating exceptional single-player experiences that have critics raving about them, but they're never able to achieve the massive commercial success that other single-player games of the same ilk can achieve.</p>
<p>Even Alan Wake 2, for example, only recently surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/">2 million copies sold</a> since its 2023 launch. That's not to say 2 million isn't a huge milestone, but it makes you scratch your head when you think about the fact that Alan Wake 2 is widely agreed to be one of the best single-player games and narrative experiences in video games in years. It gave Baldur's Gate III a real run for its money when everyone thought Baldur's Gate was a shoo-in for game of the year. And yet, Alan Wake 2 is well behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-reportedly-sold-15-million-copies-vincke-hopes-next-gen-tech-will-bring-his-dream-rpg-closer/">Baldur's Gate III's 15+ million copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>It's not surprising, therefore, to learn that Remedy is looking to streamline its process, so it can still make the kinds of games it is renowned for, without fear that it won't survive.</p>
<p>Control 2 is currently in <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-full-production-remedy/">full production</a>, but in the meantime, Remedy's next game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/">FBC Firebreak</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game set within the world of Control, which is due out next month on June 17, 2025, on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-tips-for-starting-revenge-of-the-savage-planet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> is a new Metroid-like adventure from Raccoon Logic Studios, which kicks off by dropping you on some backwater planet in space, with no gear, no backup on the way, and pretty much nothing at your disposal besides your wits and what you can salvage from your ship's wreckage.</p>
<p>It's a very open-ended start to the game, and you'll see your quest list fill up faster than you can get to everything on it. But there are a few tasks that you should prioritize, and a few gameplay&nbsp; when you land in Nu Florida, to really get the best experience possible out of your time with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>
<h2>Best Tips For Starting Revenge of the Savage Planet</h2>
<h3>ABS - Always Be Scanning/Surveying</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>While the whole opening premise of Revenge of the Savage Planet is that you're dropped on this planet with nothing, there are plenty of resources in the wreckage from your ship, the tech that Alta Interglobal has left behind, and just the natural resources from the planets you visit, that you can use to make your journey easier. Scanning everything you can is also part of your character's progression, so whenever you enter a new area, it's worth jumping into the scanner mode to see if anything is highlighted orange, which means it hasn't yet been scanned.</p>
<p>The second part of this is to always be surveying the area. If you're playing on a controller, then you're going to be constantly clicking R3. This helps you keep the direction you're heading in top of mind, because it's very easy to lose track of your goal otherwise.</p>
<h3>Get Your Upgrades Sorted</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are plenty of upgrades you can shoot for at the top of the game, and you'll hit all the key ones by going through the main questlines, like adding a grapple to your whip. But there are a few you also need to prioritize from the start. No fall damage is a huge one, for example, that you should clear as soon as you can. Same goes for getting a double-jump, though that is unfortunately more involved than it should be, since you need to complete multiple environmental tasks to get to the point where you can unlock the double-jump upgrade. Upgrading your mask to filter out toxic gas is another that you'll want to get as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Basically, if it's to do with exploration and movement, you should focus on doing it as soon as you can. It's worth your time to jump to the next planet and progress the story to hit some of these key upgrades that can make the time you spend just exploring each planet you go to a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>Isolate Before You Capture</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>In the same way you'll want to scan everything, you'll want to capture all the fauna you encounter in Revenge of the Savage Planet. In some cases, doing so is pretty straightforward. Some of them don't require you to stun them first, you can sneak up and grab them with your whip. Most, however, will require that you engage them in combat and hit a weak spot a few times before you can whip them and pull them into what looks like a wormhole, transporting them back to your home base. Any damage you take while pulling them into the wormhole will stop you from being able to pull them in, and you'll have to redo the whole capture process.</p>
<p>There are often multiples of the kinds of creatures you'll be looking to capture all hanging out together, and trying to capture one of them in a scenario where the rest will surely catch on to what you're doing is a recipe for disaster. Until you've eaten enough of the orange goo you'll find on each planet, and even after you've upgraded your health and stamina significantly, you're very squishy. You'll die faster than you think if you aren't careful with how you approach a group of creatures, and you need to capture at least one of each to research them and unlock more upgrades for yourself.</p>
<p>So don't just try and pull one in if it's not completely safe. The animation for doing so is far slower than I would have liked it to be, and while Raccoon Logic could make it a tad faster, that feels unlikely. Best to be prepared and plan your capture strategy when approaching a new group of creatures you haven't researched yet.</p>
<h3>Avoid combat whenever possible</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>You gain some resources from killing the local fauna on each planet, and you're often thrown into scenarios where you need to fight your way out. But when you're exploring the planets you visit, avoid combat as often as you can.</p>
<p>It'll be difficult because many creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet are hostile just from you walking by them, so you'll hear the combat music start and stop plenty of times throughout your playthrough. But trust me when I say it's a much better use of your time to try and find resources in the environment through whatever objective you have or environmental puzzles you find. Those will always give you more resources than random combat scenarios will.</p>
<h3>Your Blaster Sucks On Purpose, Use Everything Around You Instead</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>The blaster you start the game with, for the most part, sucks. But it sucks for a reason, which is that you're not meant to just pull out your blaster with every hostile creature you face. It'll help you, for sure, but you're also meant to use the environment around you. Don't just rely on your blaster to take care of everything.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's not because your blaster won't be able to handle whatever you come across. It will, but it won't be as effective, or as efficient, as the environmental hazards you can use to your advantage. Especially after you've unlocked the ability to fire various kinds of goo.</p>
<hr>
<p>These are the main things you'll want to know when starting Revenge of the Savage Planet, and if you keep them in mind, you're sure to have a smooth start in the game's early hours.</p>
