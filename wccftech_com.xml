			<p>This week, several Polish websites <a href="https://www.gram.pl/news/microsoft-wycofuje-xboxy-w-polsce-konsola-stala-sie-niedostepna-w-sprzedazy#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Xbox Series X consoles were nowhere to be found in stores. These reports sparked rumors that Microsoft would essentially retire from selling the hardware in the European country.</p>
<p>We reached out to Microsoft and received the following comment from a spokesperson:</p>
<p><em>While we expect to have limited Xbox Series X supply in Poland this holiday due to player demand, Xbox Series S consoles will still be available. Players can visit <a href="http://xbox.com/regions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xbox.com/regions</a> to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
<p>Fans of the Green team have been increasingly antsy following Microsoft's big policy change around first-party games. More games are getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ported</a> to other consoles (chiefly Sony's PlayStation 5) right away, and there's a growing concern that this, coupled with the consistently low sales for the past couple of years, might eventually persuade Microsoft to just give up on its own console ecosystem and focus on making games for all platforms instead.</p>
<p>It does not seem like there's much to worry about on that front for the time being. At the same time, there's no guarantee that the situation will not change in the future.</p>

			<p>GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a few days after the debut of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl that over a million units of the game had already been sold. That is in addition to all the PC and Xbox users playing it through Game Pass. The game was in development for a very long time, though, raising questions about its&nbsp;profitability.</p>
<p>However, GSC Game World investor Maksym Krippa told <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes Ukraine</a> that STALKER 2 is actually already profitable, despite the company's expense of 'tens of millions of dollars' for development and marketing. Moreover, Krippa also revealed that talks are underway with Netflix for a potential adaptation. The game would join a growing list of game adaptations making it to the small and big screen, as film and TV production companies realize the intrinsic potential of the largest game franchises.</p>
<p>On TV, the most successful adaptations have been The Last of Us on HBO and Fallout on Amazon Prime Video. Twisted Metal and Like a Dragon: Yakuza got mixed receptions in their debut seasons, while Resident Evil and Halo have already been canceled after one and two seasons, respectively.</p>
<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog movies and Uncharted have recently been successful in theaters, though the real blockbuster was The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> all records for a film adaptation. On the other hand, the Borderlands movie was absolutely terrible in terms of box office revenue and reception alike.</p>
<p>Let's hope the STALKER 2 film or TV, if it does happen, is a quality one. Meanwhile, GSC Game World continues to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-0-3-delivers-more-crash-and-bug-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve</a> the game with updates. There's a lot more on the way, including modding tools, multiplayer, DLCs, and more enhancements to the experience. The Ukrainian developer is committed to supporting the latest entry in its flagship series for a long time.</p>
