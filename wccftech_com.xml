			<p>IO Interactive had one final holiday surprise for players ahead of the release of its next game, 007 First Light: a delay. The studio announced that the game has been delayed by two months and will no longer release on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">previously announced release date of March 27, 2026</a>. Now, it will launch on May 27, 2026.</p>



<p>The news came in the form of a statement shared on the game's official social media accounts, where the studio writes, "<em>As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring that we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we revealed the game. We look</em> <em>forward to sharing more updates regarding 007 First Light in early 2026</em>."</p>







<p>When IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/">first announced that it would be making a James Bond game back in 2020</a>, which we knew at the time by the name of Project 007, everyone <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-bond-and-io-interactive-are-a-match-made-in-heaven-says-mgm-itll-be-special/">agreed it was like putting peanut butter and chocolate together</a>. No other developer could be better suited to bring Bond into modern video games, and it's been exciting to know that 007 First Light is coming down the pipeline for next year.</p>



<p>A two-month delay for polishing and bug fixes can't really do much to quell that excitement, as IO Interactive and James Bond fans alike would prefer the team take the necessary time it needs to get everything right and in its proper place.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we're sure to learn more about 007 First Light as we dig into the first half of 2026, especially <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-debuts-new-beyond-the-light-bts-007-first-light-series/">as IO continues its 'Beyond the Light' BTS series</a>. Recently, at The Game Awards, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-trailer-showcases-lenny-kravitz-as-latest-bond-villain/">we saw the official reveal of Lenny Kravitz as Bawma, one of the villains in the new Bond story IO Interactive has crafted</a>, and prior to that, we got confirmation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/">IO would be including Bond's iconic Aston Martin Valhalla</a>.</p>



<p>We also got the chance <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/">to speak with IO Interactive about the story it crafted for 007 First Light, and you can check out that interview here.</a> </p>

			<p>When <strong>Epic Games</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> <strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong> (UE 5.7 from now on in this article) a month and a half ago, it immediately appeared to be a significant improvement in various regards, at least on paper. The addition of <strong>Nanite foliage</strong>, although experimental, was very exciting, while the <strong>MegaLights</strong> feature promised to increase the number of dynamic shadow-casting lights that developers could add to their games without crashing the frame rate.</p>



<p>Last week, YouTuber MxBenchmarkPC <a href="https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested UE 5.7 against UE 5.4</a> in a Venice-set tech demo and noticed measurable performance gains. Would these additions and changes still be equally beneficial in an actual game, though?</p>



<p>I got an answer to that question from <strong>Studio Wildcard</strong> Co-Founder, Co-Creative Director, Lead Designer, Lead Programmer, and Development Director <strong>Jeremy Stieglitz</strong>, as part of a much larger interview on <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended</strong> and its recently released narrative-driven <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-lost-colony-dlc-expansion-out-now-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony DLC</a></strong>.</p>



<p>When I asked him what had changed in the reception of ARK: Survival Ascended since <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-first-ue5-gameplay-cross-platform-modding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the early access launch two years ago</a>, with recent user reviews finally reaching <strong>Mostly Positive</strong> on Steam, he pointed out the performance improvements as a major reason. Then, he revealed that UE 5.7 is already being tested internally, is expected to be released in March 2026, and is <strong>'as close to a magic bullet'</strong> in delivering better performance as one can imagine, particularly with the Nanite foliage.</p>



<p><strong><em>Jeremy Stieglitz:</em> </strong><em>When the game came out, it didn't run very well. It still doesn't run as well as it should, frankly, but we're up about 50% performance-wise over the initial release of the game on the same hardware. It's a really significant improvement, but it's not ultimately where we want to be. Where are we going to get more performance from? Well, a big part of it is actually with Epic's latest version of Unreal Engine 5.7, which introduces some serious new performance-oriented improvements and systems. 5.6 did as well, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we're still on 5.5</a>. So, the performance improvements of 5.6 combined with the new features of 5.7 are going to gain us about another 30 to 40% on both the GPU and the CPU. UE 5.6 did a lot of render thread optimizations, where they made things work much better in parallel between the render thread and the game thread and the GPU and the CPU. There's major architectural changes in 5.6, and in UE 5.7, they added an entirely new system for how to draw large foliage, demonstrated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher IV demo</a>, for example. </em></p>



<p><em>And we're actually able to utilize that directly. We have this working internally. We are just still preparing it for release. It's going to take a few months to work all the kinks out of other parts of the engine that have been upgraded, but we can already say that it's about a third performance gain on our existing maps due to the use of this new Nanite tesselation and culling system that Epic has introduced in UE 5.7 for foliage. We're really, really excited about that. It's as close to a magic bullet as you're going to get at this point, and it's one of those rare cases where it's an unalloyed win. There's no real caveats or asterisks. It works way better than what existed before, and we don't have to sacrifice anything to make it work. So, it was as close to a magic solution for some of those performance problems as possible. We expect the UE 5.7 upgrade for ARK: Survival Ascended to roll out by the end of March of this coming year.</em></p>



<p>When I asked whether UE 5.7 would help get rid of the dreadful stuttering that gamers have to suffer in ARK but also generally in Unreal Engine games, Stieglitz replied that it would, but players shouldn't expect stutters to be entirely gone.</p>



<p><strong><em>Jeremy Stieglitz: </em></strong><em>It should be better, but I don't know that it will be completely eliminated because of two factors. One, in ARK in particular, some of the stuttering is due to the initiation of actors which cannot be multi-threaded. When you are playing an online game and you go to a new area and a giant base that somebody has built gets loaded on the client, it really has to be done instantaneously as soon as we get that data. We could possibly try to multi-thread it, but Unreal Engine 5 is pretty bad about network actor instantiation and multi-threading. I don't know if they have an inherent system for that. In other words, when the client receives an actor like a dino or a building over the network, it wants to immediately spawn that to start receiving the network data associated with it immediately. Now, multiply that by 50,000. When you've got 50,000 structures that you've got to spawn and you receive them in a big batch of data all in a single frame, as you can imagine, that's going to result in a hitch. It has nothing to do with graphics or background loading of the world. It's literally that it just received 50,000 game objects over the network and needs to prepare them for play because it's about to receive network data associated with them.</em></p>



<p><em>That's part of the stuttering that's unique to ARK. That's probably the main stuttering people receive when they're playing online, especially associated with large bases. There's another kind of stuttering that's more associated with background loading of the world. A lot of that's been eliminated in more recent versions of Unreal Engine and smoothed out, but there's one that I think is somewhat particular to Unreal games in general that it relates to shader caching. We don't do pre-shader caching, so I think it has to generate some shader code on the fly from the kind of intermediate shader code that's HLSL basically and it has to prepare it for uploading to the GPU, and I believe it does that on the fly. It's specific to your GPU hardware, and that can result in stalls. The way a lot of Unreal games can eliminate that and do is they pre-cache all the shaders they can for your hardware on startup. The issue why I don't like doing that with ARK is that we've just got so much content that I don't think it would be practical in terms of how long it would take. And the second thing is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we also do modding</a>, which makes it even more unpredictable what kind of materials and shaders we're going to need to compile.</em></p>



<p><em>In practice, I think the modding would make it very ineffective even if we did it for the base game content. There would still be stalls due to that because, for one thing, when you play online we do allow people to create custom cosmetics. It's an option people can turn off, but by default, those get downloaded dynamically to people as they play. So, you can encounter people with arbitrary cosmetics on their character or their bases as you play the game. And those can have completely unique materials and therefore unique shaders. There's no real way to pre-cache those because we don't know what they are in advance. I think over time Epic might be able to thread those things even better than they are now, but I do think that hitching in a game which doesn't pre-compile all the shaders is always going to exist to some extent. I will say that I think it's gotten a lot better since the earlier versions of Unreal Engine 5 to UE 5.7 and I wouldn't be surprised to see continued improvements there as Epic continues to iterate on the engine. For our part, we expect to do at least one major engine upgrade per year going forward. We found that we got a good sense of how to do it reasonably efficiently with our upgrade from 5.2 to 5.5 last year in June. We'll do it again to UE 5.7 in March, which we've already begun on, and then wherever Epic is with the version in early to mid 2027 as well.</em></p>



<p>The full interview with Stieglitz has a lot more details on performance enhancements and on ARK: Survival Ascended as a whole, including its roadmap all the way to ARK 2 (now tentatively slated for 2028). Look forward to its publication soon.</p>

			<p>It feels almost sacrilegious that, in a year when a new Nintendo console was released, a Mario game isn't in the running for one of the year's Best Platformers. That doesn't mean 2025 was a slouch in terms of which games were the best at jumping from one ledge to another - just that it's not what anyone would've predicted going into 2025.</p>



<p>That said, there are Nintendo Switch and Switch 2-exclusive titles on this list, so Nintendo did have something for platformer fans to go along with their new console. Here are our picks for the best platformers in 2025.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Role-Playing Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Fighting Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Action</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza-9-10">Donkey Kong Bananza (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">9/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-DonkeyKongBananza.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most surprising games of 2025, Donkey Kong Bananza was not the 3D platformer we thought we would get from Nintendo this year, but it more than surpassed any expectations we could have had. The platforming, world design, and most importantly, the smashing, and the different forms DK takes on his journey with a young Pauline make this one of Nintendo's more unique experiences in some time.</p>



<p>While it still might not reach the highs of a new 3D Mario platformer, Donkey Kong Bananza is able to deliver its own take on the Mario formula in a way that helped establish the character for a new generation of players and a new generation of Nintendo.</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Xbox-Game-Pass-September-2025-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight Silksong key art. Image credit: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once again, Hollow Knight Silksong's inclusion in one of our mainline lists comes because it simply cannot be ignored. Yes, Hollow Knight Silksong is a Metroidvania-style game. Yes, it has a lot of combat, and you might be able to make an argument for it being an action game.</p>



<p>But it is a platformer before it is anything else, and that is evident every minute you spend with Silksong. It is challenging 2D platforming at its finest, offering you the tools to expand your movement capabilities as you find new abilities while exploring, and then testing your skills and ability to string together an intricate series of jumps, wall-bounces, dashes, double-jumps. Anything and everything that can be thrown at you to test how good you are at jumping, Team Cherry launches - and then some.</p>



<p>It's also incredibly impressive how Team Cherry mixes platforming into its combat, almost like, if you had never played a platformer that also included combat, but had just played hundreds of hours of platformers and understood the genre and gameplay deeply, you'd be able to play and beat Silksong.</p>



<p>Because your parry timings and ability to learn enemy patterns and strike when you have an opening matter less than being able to platform and manoeuvre in whatever tightly designed room Team Cherry has you squished into this time. The question in Silksong isn't can you fight. It is, can you jump?</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8-10">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Split-Fiction.png"></a><figcaption><em>Split Fiction. Image credit: Hazelight Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jumping back to the beginning of the year, Split Fiction was one of 2025's early Game of the Year contenders, as Hazelight Studios proved once again that it knows how to craft fun and entertaining co-op adventures.</p>



<p>Split Fiction was one of the year's biggest commercial successes, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-becomes-million-seller-in-just-two-days/">over 1 million copies sold in two days</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/">there's already a film in the works with Wicked director Jon M. Chu in the driver's seat</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/">Sydney Sweeney set to play one of the two lead characters</a>. </p>



<p>While the story, which centers on two writers, Mio and Zoe (named after the two daughters of Hazelight's Josef Fares), failed to impress as much as Hazelight has with its previous co-op titles, the gameplay and inventiveness behind the situations you experience as you go through this co-op journey will stick with you long after the credits roll. </p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-7-4-10">Revenge of the Savage Planet (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">7.4/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Revenge-of-the-Savage-Planet-Key-Art.png"></a><figcaption><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet. Image credit: Raccoon Logic</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After Typhoon Studios was unceremoniously shuttered with Google shutting down its Stadia division, the team rose again as Raccoon Logic, and under its new name, with its newfound independence, released a sequel to its 2020 hit, Journey to the Savage Planet, with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>



<p>This 3D platforming action-adventure may not have the kind of intricate platforming challenges that can be found in the likes of Hollow Knight Silksong, but it has enough fun and entertaining whimsy in every element of its gameplay that carries the entire experience.</p>



<p>Its big issue is that you have to stick around long enough to see its best parts, as it gets off to a slow start. But if you can muddy through, you'll experience one of 2025's most enjoyable platforming experiences. As I wrote in my review, "<em>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with whimsical and cartoon-y animations, character designs, and smart level design that strengthens the gameplay experience when it opens up to you fully. The problem, is getting to that point, with tedious missions and upgrade pacing that halt any momentum it starts to build, and with it lacking a story with any real punch, if the charm isn't working for you, it's unlikely, and understandable, if you don't stick around long enough for it to start clicking</em>."</p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-7-5-10">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/">7.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns-HD.png"></a><figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After starting the list with Donkey Kong, he's also ending it with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD. Even with this version of the game arguably not delivering enough for players who already blew threw this adventure on previous Nintendo handhelds, DK Country Returns is undeniably a wonderfully fun platformer.</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch wrote in his review, "<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</em>"</p>

			<p>Despite being released over 10 years ago, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt remains incredibly popular, thanks to its compelling story, engaging characters, immersive world, and engaging gameplay. Following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-next-gen-looks-amazing-on-pc-when-it-works/"><strong>Next-Gen update</strong></a> which brought the game to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S while adding new features and ray-tracing support on PC, updates and new content have become progressively more sparse, but something new could be breweing that might bring back players back to the Continent next year.</p>



<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk"><strong>Strefa Inwestorów</strong></a>, Mateusz Chrzanowski, an analyst at Noble Securities, predicts that a big DLC expansion expected to cost $30 will drop for The Witcher 3 in May 2026 (the game's 11th anniversary), and will kickstart the marketing cycle for The Witcher IV, the next entry in the series, which the firm expects to release in late 2027.</p>



<p>If this is indeed the case, there's a chance that the rumored new DLC expansion will bridge the gap between the two games, possibly providing more details on how Ciri began her new journey as a Witcher.</p>



<p>Although the idea of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt receiving a new major DLC expansion over 10 years since its original release may sound unlikely to most, this isn't the first time we have heard rumors about it. This June, well-known Polish game industry commentator Borys Nieśpielak revealed that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-dlc-2026-the-last-wish-project/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">an additional story DLC for the game is supposedly in the works by Fool's Theory</strong></a>, the studio comprised of series veterans that is working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-full-open-world/"><strong>the remake of the first entry in the series</strong></a>. Reportedly, this is one of the new projects yet to be announced by CDPR.</p>



<p>As a massive fan of the world created by Andrzej Sapkowski, I would be delighted to return to the continent for one more adventure together with Geralt before he finally passes the torch to Ciri. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-netflix-live-action-series-announced-by-ubisoft/">All the way back in 2020</a>, Netflix and Ubisoft announced that they were working on a live-action adaptation of Ubisoft's marquee franchise, Assassin's Creed. For nearly five years after that announcement, the show seemingly didn't make any progress. Though <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">after getting the green light this past July</a>, the show has already begun to find members of its cast, and now, a director.</p>



<p>A report from November <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-series-casts-toby-wallace-as-co-lead/">confirmed that Toby Wallace would star as one of the co-lead characters in the adaptation</a>, and now a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/">Variety</a> adds that Johan Renck, the Emmy-winning director best known for his work on Chernobyl, the series created by HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin, has been tapped to direct Assassin's Creed for Netflix.</p>



<p>The report also adds that, beyond Wallace, Lola Petticrew, Zachary Hart, and Laura Marcus have all joined the cast as regulars for the series, though we don't yet know who any of the actors will be playing as details of the adaptation's plot are being kept quiet for now.</p>



<p>We do know that the series will begin filming in Italy in 2026, and that Italy is also reportedly the geographical setting for the series. The show's logline says the story will be "<em>centred on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny</em>."</p>



<p>If you know anything about Assassin's Creed, then you know that the logline does nothing more than outline the basic facts of the game's stories since the first game was released back in 2007. So it seems like we'll be waiting for a while longer before actually learning what era and elements of the Assassin's Creed story the show will lean on.</p>



<p>The series is being led by showrunners Roberto Patino and David Weiner, with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, and Genevieve Jones from Ubisoft's film and television department serving as executive producers. </p>
