            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last Friday, The Pok√©mon Company <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, the latest entry in the ever-popular monster catching franchise, had sold 5.8 million copies in its debut week.</p>



<p>Now, Circana's Senior Director &amp; Video Game Industry Thought Leader, Mat Piscatella, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's retail launch was particularly big in the United States, where it registered the best performance of the last two and a half years.</p>



<p><em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A had a massive US launch at retail. Launch week physical unit and dollar sales of Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A were the biggest for a new physical video game launch since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom back in May of 2023.</em></p>



<p>It's not at all surprising that Nintendo games excel at retail sales performance. PlayStation and Xbox users have long since switched to digital games, but the Nintendo audience is different and still quite linked to physical units.</p>



<p>In Europe, though, the retail launch was a bit smaller. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pokemon-legends-z-a-captures-no1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Game Business</a>, which had access to GSD data, Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A managed to knock EA's Battlefield 6 from the top position but also registered a 28% sales drop compared to the debut week of Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus in 2022. Indeed, as noted back when the official sales announcement was shared last week, Arceus had sold 6.5 million units in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>Still, the game appears to have received the acclaim of fans and critics alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch wrote:</p>



<p><em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully constructed Pok√©mon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-battlefield-redsec-launches-tomorrow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-battlefield-6-free-to-play-battle-royale-mode-officially-called-battlefield-redsec-launches-tomorrow.1335916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 battle royale mode has finally been revealed and will officially be called Battlefield REDSEC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/">As rumoured</a>, it'll launch tomorrow, and it'll be free-to-play.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios revealed the mode with <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155">a short post on the official Battlefield X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, which included a link to a gameplay trailer that'll go live tomorrow, alongside the mode itself going live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We'll have more official knowledge on the mode tomorrow when the gameplay trailer goes live, which will likely <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news">be followed by a blog post on the Battlefield 6 website</a>, though for now we do have other claims from ModernWarzeon, the X (formerly Twitter) account who initially leaked the REDSEC title and correctly claimed it would be shadow dropped tomorrow.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, Battlefield REDSEC will arrive with a Duos and Squads queues, letting players hop in as teams of two or teams of four, with a maximum player count of 100 players for matches.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>üö® BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST üö®</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>‚Äî ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Battlefield REDSEC will also be arriving alongside Season 1 for Battlefield 6, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">which, as I noted in my preview,</a> is adding a couple of stellar Conquest maps with Blackwell Ridge and Eastwood, but a couple of lacklustre game modes with the permanent and limited time modes to come. What makes the arrival of REDSEC even more exciting is that it'll be a peek at what is arguably going to be the best map in Battlefield 6, Eastwood, since the opening map for REDSEC is set in Southern California.</p>



<p>REDSEC is EA and Battlefield Studio's response to Call of Duty: Warzone, and it could not have come at a more opportune time for Battlefield since the Call of Duty brand <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">continues to be in an identity crisis</a>. It also seems like EA and Battlefield Studios are taking advantage of Battlefield 6 launching more than a month ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, capitalizing on FPS players who would otherwise be spending their time waiting for the new Call of Duty to release.</p>



<p>Of course, they could still be doing that while playing Battlefield 6, dropping it for Black Ops 7 when that arrives in November, but for now EA has the chance to get its hooks into players that would otherwise not give Battlefield the time of day. We'll see how REDSEC does when it arrives tomorrow.</p>

			<p>The current generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles is now more than five years old, making it well past the time we would start hearing about what the next generation of consoles will look like. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">seen several rumours</a> on what the next-generation Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">hardware will include</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">on top of comments</a> from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-president-says-game-exclusives-are-antiquated/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, a picture of Xbox's next console is starting to form. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">Windows Central</a> seems to piece it together a bit more clearly, framing the next Microsoft console as a best of both worlds between the PC and console experience.</p>



<p>The report leans both on comments from Microsoft executives like Sarah Bond and Phil Spencer and sources who spoke to Windows Central, so understand that nothing about this is finalized, but it does paint a picture that makes sense as to what the next console from Microsoft will look like.</p>



<p>Both Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond have alluded to the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handhelds</a> as a peek at Microsoft's thinking for its next generation of hardware, with the Xbox Play Anywhere becoming more of the focus with all Xbox games being playable on the Xbox PC app and Xbox consoles moving forward.</p>



<p>According to Windows Central's report, what those allusions mean is that the next-generation Xbox console will provide a console experience with its UI and the ability to natively play console games, though its foundation will be that of "<em>a curated Windows gaming PC</em>."</p>



<p>Basically, you'll be able to access your Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, and Battle.net games just like you're able to on a PC, with the Xbox Full-Screen Experience that's currently live on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Ally handhelds acting as the home base for the device. On top of all those libraries, you'll also be able to access and play all the games currently playable on your Xbox Series X/S consoles, including original Xbox titles, Xbox 360 games, and your full catalogue of backwards compatible titles already available on Series X/S.</p>



<p>Another part of what'll make this device a 'best of both worlds' between console and PC is that the paywall for playing online multiplayer games will be removed for the next generation. Since the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 days, console players have had to pay for the ability to play multiplayer games online, whereas that has never been the case for PC players. That paywall will finally be removed with Microsoft's next console, according to this report, to further align itself with the PC gaming experience this new device is allegedly trying to provide.</p>



<p>Of course, this will also come with more changes to the structure of Microsoft's Game Pass service, though those details aren't clear, and likely won't be until we're much closer to the actual release of next-generation hardware.</p>



<p>It's an interesting proposal, to say the least, that we'll finally see a combination of PC perks like having access to multiple gaming libraries and not having to pay for online multiplayer on top of the ease-of-use that consoles provide. If Microsoft can execute on it all, that is.</p>
