			<p>The implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler isn't perfect in all titles due to some games reportedly using an older version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>Commenting on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/df-star-wars-jedi-survivor-ps5-pro-severe-image-quality-problems-but-rt-in-performance-mode-is-nice.1038024/page-4#post-131783178"> ResetERA forums</a> in a thread discussing the disappointing Star Wars Jedi: Survivor PS5 Pro update, a developer going by the name of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/koralsky.22833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koralsky</a> commented on the poor image quality produced by PSSR in certain titles, revealing that the difference in image quality between different games is caused by the different versions of the upscaler used. In regard to the latest entry in the Respawn series, the developer confirmed the game is using SDK 9, being an Unreal Engine 4 game, so the team couldn't implement the latest up-to-date version of the upscaler that requires SDK 10 or higher, and has possibly used the very first version, hence the bad image quality.</p>
<p>While Koralsky couldn't provide more details on how many iterations of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler are already available and how each version improves on the previous, they could confirm that users should expect IQ improvements in the second and third batches of PS5 Pro-supported games using PSSR. In a game the developer is currently working on, for example, one of the later versions of PSSR, but not the latest, is giving much better results in comparison to TSR and FSR, and, as such, they expect the upscaler to get in a much better state in six, twelve months, compared to the state it is in the first batch of PS5 Pro supported titles.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro console is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the recently released mid-generation system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>
