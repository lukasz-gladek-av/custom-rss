			<p>The <strong>GDC State of the Game Industry Report 2026</strong> is <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">officially out</a>, offering insights into the video game industry based on responses from over <strong>2,300 game industry workers</strong>. Respondents answered questions about everything from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/i-cant-fully-trust-anywhere-now-gdc-reports-1-in-4-devs-have-been-laid-off-in-last-2-years/">industry layoffs</a></strong> to popular game engines and platforms, and the current, longstanding hot-button industry topic, <strong>Generative AI (GenAI).</strong></p>



<p>For some people in the video game industry, GenAI tools are the latest technological innovation that will revolutionize the game development process. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/"><strong>Everyone will use them if they aren't already</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">they'll be as commonplace as anything else</a>. Others think <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/"><strong>there is absolutely no place for them</strong></a> in game development, not even if you're trying to ride that middle lane where you think <a href="https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/">it'll be helpful for some things</a>, but nothing can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">replicate or replace the <strong>"<em>human</em>"</strong> element in creation</a>.</p>



<p>While <strong>one-third (35%)</strong> of respondents said they don't personally use GenAI for their jobs, a <strong>majority (52%) said GenAI tools are used</strong> at their studios, which has also resulted in more studios creating policies around its use. Only <strong>15% of respondents</strong> said their company did not have a policy on the use of GenAI tools, with <strong>78% confirming that there is policy language</strong> of some kind at their studio. The remaining <strong>7%</strong> said they were unsure.</p>



<p>Policies are also getting more specific, with <strong>22%</strong> of respondents saying that only specific tools are allowed and not others. Most are using LLMs like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-healths-integration-with-chatgpt-health-reportedly-allows-for-fallacious-and-inconsistent-diagnoses/">ChatGPT</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/apples-gemini-siri-deal-is-worth-at-least-5-billion-for-google-indicating-that-the-deal-would-last-through-2030/">Google Gemini</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy/">Microsoft Copilot</a></strong>, which lines up for what they're using these tools for. "<em>Research or brainstorming</em>" was the most common response, with second going to daily tasks, including writing emails, code assistance, and prototyping. Only <strong>5% of respondents</strong> said they used GenAI tools for "<em>player-facing features</em>," <strong>10%</strong> for procedural generation, and <strong>19%</strong> for asset generation. </p>

<p>For some respondents, it's clear that these tools are essential, more for their efficiency than anything else. "<em>We are a small team, so it is making us capable of achieving more than we would without it</em>," said one respondent who is an executive working at an indie studio.</p>



<p>But even with this increased use and necessity, as the report reads, "<em>it appears the more the game industry professionals know about Generative AI, the less they like it</em>."  <strong>52% of respondents</strong> believe GenAI tech is having<strong> a negative impact on the video game industry</strong>. It's a <strong>30% bump</strong> compared to last year's GDC survey, but even within the negative majority are people who use it because they have to, or feel like they have to for their work. "<em>AI is theft</em>," begins one response from a developer in Ukraine. "<em>I have to use it, otherwise I'm gonna get fired</em>."</p>



<p>What's more interesting than looking at the percentages, though, are some of the quotes from individual developers who answered positively, negatively, or with mixed reactions about GenAI tools and tech.</p>

<p>Again, it should be noted that this annual survey is just a sample size; it's not a complete picture of the industry, and there's still a lot to be figured out with where GenAI tech lands not just in video games and video game development, but in other industries around the world.</p>



<p>At least with its increased use, more studios are writing guidelines as to how it should be used, and most of its use doesn't seem to make it to our actual monitors when we sit down for a night of gaming. That will likely continue to be what players care about the most, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/"><strong>Studio Atelico</strong> told Wccftech in a recent interview,</a> "<em></em><em><strong>I strongly believe that what players and people in general are opposed to is not actually AI, but rather the exploitation of people and 'slop.'"</strong></em> </p>

			<p><strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong> has officially found yet another cast member, and this time it's <strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll recognize from Apple's hit show <strong>Severance</strong>, who has been tapped to play <strong>Thor</strong>.</p>



<p>The confirmation comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/">Deadline</a>, but Wccftech readers who've been following our coverage of the show as casting ramps up ahead of a reported <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">March 2026 filming start</a></strong>, we already had our suspicions that Ólafsson would be picking up Mjolnir. A report from a website called <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> had previously identified Ólafsson for Thor, which has now been proven to be correct, after it had already been proven correct about casting for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Sif</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Heimdall</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Now that those three casting choices were proven to be more than just rumours, it gives more credence to the report's fourth casting rumour, which was that <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as <strong>Mimir</strong> for the show. As a fan-favourite character, keeping Duncan for the role of Mimir would go a long way with fans who remain unsure about the upcoming God of War adaptation.</p>



<p>Ólafsson now officially joins <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong>, <strong>Teresa Palmer</strong>, and <strong>Max Parker</strong> in the cast, with Hurst being tapped to play Kratos, Palmer for Sif, and Parker for Heimdall. We still don't have a casting confirmation, or even a rumour for key roles like <strong>Atreus</strong>, <strong>Baldur</strong>, and <strong>Freya</strong>, but hopefully those will be revealed soon, if filming is still set to begin in March. </p>



<p>The show is being led by <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong>, who signed on as showrunner after the original showrunners and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong> had a falling out</a> in terms of the direction they wanted to take with the show.</p>



<p>While we still don't have concrete plot details for the direction the show will take, hopefully, some of the success that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">Amazon's Fallout</a></strong> show has had will rub off on this upcoming God of War series. </p>
