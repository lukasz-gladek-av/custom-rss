			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will add its highly-requested two-player mode next week on July 30, 2025, with Patch 1.02, and while the introduction of duo expeditions remains the highlight for the update, FromSoftware is also adding a few key quality-of-life and UI improvements in the patch, like better filtering options for relics.</p>



<p>FromSoftware's co-operative multiplayer roguelike action game has gone better than anyone might've expected when the game was first announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">The Game Awards 2024</a>. In its launch month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-topped-us-sales-charts-may-2025/">topping sales charts in the US</a> and breaking into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">top five on more global charts</a>.  It stayed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">top-10 for US game sales for June</a>, and remained <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">one of the top-15 best-selling games globally</a>. </p>



<p>The introduction of a duos mode, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">something players have requested</a> since FromSoftware tested the game's servers in an open beta (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-mods-framerate-two-player-mode-easier-solo/">already implemented themselves through mods</a>) is sure to give the community a boost, and might even convince some players who have been on the fence to finally pick it up, knowing that they can hop in with the one other friend they have, and no longer be handicapped by being unable to find a third friend to play with. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It'll be interesting to see where Nightreign stands when we get a look at sales and engagement charts for July halfway through next month. Even though this update is coming right at the end of the month, it has approximately two days to make a significant impact.</p>



<p>FromSoftware also recently celebrated Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">surpassing 5 million units sold since it launched in May</a>, a huge milestone for the company's first major foray into multiplayer and the first time it has adapted one of its major narrative and action-driven Souls games into an online multiplayer experience. </p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how FromSoftware's second foray into turning elements players recognize from its single-player games into a multiplayer experience goes when <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> arrives as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New details on CD Projekt Red's mysterious Project Hadar emerged online today thanks to a new job ad discovered online.</p>



<p>As spotted by<a href="https://tech4gamers.com/cdpr-project-hadar-action-rpg-melee-combat/"> Tech4Gamers</a>, CD Projekt Red is looking to hire a Senior Gameplay Designer specifically for the development of Project Hadar, a new IP from the studio, with at least 5 years of experience in the RPG/action titles with melee-oriented combat, suggesting the game will have a major focus on close range combat. The rest of the required qualifications don't reveal anything new about this game, such as experience in working with Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5, as the studio announced a while back that Epic's engine would power its future projects.</p>



<p>Project Hadar is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-3-witcher-projects-new-ip-in-development-cd-projekt-red/">many projects</a> in development at CD Projekt Red, which include a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, currently known as Project Orion, and the next entry in The Witcher series, The Witcher 4. Revealed last year during The Game Awards show, the next entry in the series, which will star Ciri in place of Geralt of Rivia, is being made with a console-first approach and will take<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/"> full advantage of the generational shift </a>since The Witcher 3. How this will be achieved remains to be seen, but if the tech demo shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">last month</a> is of any indication, it definitely looks like CD Projekt Red will have no trouble surpassing anything it has released so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published a <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/nintendo-switch-2-launch-what-early-digital-data-reveals-for-third-party-games">new report</a> looking at the data from early digital sales on the Nintendo Switch 2, as Newzoo's product manager, Max Otten, tried to get an early answer to the question of whether the Switch 2 is a viable ecosystem for third-party developers and publishers.</p>



<p>Otten looked at digital sales data for June 2025 from six major markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, and saw that three out of the top five games by units sold on the Nintendo Switch 2 were third-party titles. At the top of them all? Toby Fox's long-awaited Undertale follow-up, Deltarune.</p>



<p>Deltarune doing well isn't the biggest surprise, considering that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">a week ago</a>, Newzoo reported that it had made it into the top-20 games by revenue for June 2025. However, that knowledge doesn't exactly wear off the shock of seeing it over top of Mario Kart World, though this is where it's important to remember that the sales data Newzoo is pulling from does <strong>not</strong> include physical sales. In the US alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">82% of people who bought a Switch 2 also bought Mario Kart World in a physical forma</a>t, so it makes sense that the digital sales aren't as chart-topping as you might expect.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though perhaps the most surprising aspect of Newzoo's report is seeing Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in second place behind Deltarune, and ahead of Mario Kart World in third. Otten's guess at what happened here, while accurately calling Welcome Tour "<em>essentially a tech demo</em>" in the same breath, is that the combination of its "<em>low price and lack of launch-window exclusives likely helped drive</em> <em>sales</em>."</p>



<p>Rounding out the rest of the top five is Minecraft in the number four spot, and No Man's Sky in the number five spot, and once again, at least one of those games is not the third-party title you'd expect. Minecraft isn't a surprise, but No Man's Sky is, at least slightly, when considering that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37qmdfn2k">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Switch 2 has been one of the standout third-party releases so far, at least in the US.</p>



<p>That top five changes slightly when Otten looks at which games that were exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 had the biggest revenue share, with Mario Kart World in its expected top spot, followed by Fantasy Life I in second, Cyberpunk 2077 in third, No Man's Sky in fourth and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in fifth, making it once again a three-to-two third-party games majority.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, the only top five Otten shows in his report, where the majority of games listed are first-party Nintendo titles, is the list of top five titles by monthly active users for June 2025. Mario Kart World, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons take first, third, fourth, and fifth place on that list, respectively. Fortnite is the only third-party entry in the number two spot.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>All this said, Otten closes his report by saying that "<em>While first-party titles command overall sales leadership, there are clear pockets of spending on third-party content—especially for games that are well-optimized, offer genre diversity, or present new experiences to the platform."</em></p>



<p>He adds that "<em>early data shows glimmers of promise for third-party titles at launch, and players are showing up for enhanced ports, narrative games, and non-traditional Switch genres.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll learn more about how viable the Nintendo Switch 2 ecosystem is for third-party titles the deeper into the console's life we go. Only looking at first-month sales in select major markets and sticking with digital sales is nowhere close to the whole picture. But Otten has shown how even new third-party titles can find chart-topping success. It'll be interesting to see what else is able to top the charts in the coming months. </p>
