					<p>Yes, I've played STALKER 2's final version. It's real, and yet it feels surreal to write this review after all the problems this project has gone through across more than a decade. This could have easily gone the way of Duke Nukem Forever, and I'm glad it didn't.</p>
<p>We first <a href="http://wccftech.com/stalker-2-set-release-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> the name STALKER 2 fourteen years ago, just a few months after the launch of Call of Pripyat. GSC Game World founder and CEO Sergiy Grygorovych commented that the franchise's four million sales more than warranted a proper sequel, which the developer estimated to be coming in 2012. Unfortunately, the Ukrainian team faced financial hardships and had to be dissolved in late 2011. At that point, everyone thought STALKER 2 would never be made, but the team was put back together three years later.</p>
<p>GSC Game World's first order of business was releasing a new entry in their real-time strategy series Cossacks, but their true objective was to make the next STALKER title. The second announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-in-development-targeting-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> in 2018, with a tentative release window set for 2021. Of course, game development is complicated, and the studio was never particularly famous for its punctuality. As such, there were two entirely unsurprising delays to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-debut-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April</a> 2022 and then to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-delayed-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December</a> 2022, with a bonus NFT-based controversy (the idea was quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-wont-have-blockchain-nfts-anymore-after-massive-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set aside</a> following the community's massive backlash) spruced in the middle for good measure.</p>
<p>The real problems were yet to begin, though. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, GSC Game World was <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> to stop working on STALKER 2 for a few months before <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-developer-gsc-game-world-moving-ukraine-prague/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocating</a> to Prague. Still, even after that, the impact of the nearby war inevitably slowed the Ukrainian developers. There were also more incidents, such as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-studio-gsc-game-world-hacked-russian-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberattack</a> from Russian hackers and&nbsp;an office fire <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-suffers-office-fire-due-to-electrical-installation-malfunction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> by an electrical malfunction. Still, the team persevered throughout this veritable ordeal, and we can now play the game at long last. Is it any good, though? I would say mostly, with some fairly sizable caveats.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stalker-2-screenshots.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the STALKER series, the first thing to understand is that this is not your average shooter game. The protagonist of this sequel, Skif, is not some sort of superhero or even an incredibly hardened veteran soldier. He's just another stalker who had happily returned to the Mainland from the Zone but is forced to go back to the irradiated Chornobyl area after an anomaly inexplicably destroys his home.</p>
<p>In gameplay terms, this means you'll not be murdering foes left and right with incredible ease and a nearly infinite amount of ammunition at your disposal. Quite the contrary. It could be said that STALKER is the Soulslike of shooters, although the original game predates Demon's Souls by two years, making such a definition incorrect from a chronological standpoint. Even so, it gets the point across: you're going to have a hard time in this game compared to most single player shooters.</p>
<p>There's tons of things that can kill you in the Zone, such as various mutated monsters and humanoids, bandits and enemy stalkers, several anomalies scattered throughout the map, intense radiation pockets, mere fall damage from a sufficient height, and more. To give even more credit to the Souls comparison, GSC Game World actually included an actual death count on the game over screen, as you can see below. I swear most of mine were probably caused by dog and rat packs, which are arguably the most dangerous enemies in this game due to their erratic movement patterns that make them difficult to shoot at.</p>
<p>Thankfully, unlike FromSoftware, the studio behind this game added three difficulty settings to make the experience more accessible. While I play most games, including shooters, at least on Hard settings, here I had to switch to Rookie (the lowest available) after a little while due to sheer frustration. I mentioned that the game is difficult, but it's not just because of the sheer challenge provided by the AI. There's also the whole injury system and the stamina-based inventory system that add layers of complexity, perhaps too much.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-2-Heart-of-Chornobyl-Game-Over-Screen-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you're hit in STALKER 2, there's a decent chance you'll not only lose health (which does not regenerate on its own), but you'll also start bleeding. While medkits restore health, you need bandages to stem the bleeding. Similarly, you need to bring food and drinks, anti-rads, and enough ammunition whenever you venture out of the safe zones. You'll want to stock up on all these things because there is no fast travel in this game, and there's no telling when you might need them while roaming the ever-dangerous Zone. However, everything has its own weight; even quest items have weight, and the more you carry, the quicker the stamina drops.</p>
<p>While that is perfectly understandable within the context of the game's design, I feel that it is absolutely overtuned and ends up being too penalizing. Even when the inventory's weight is in the green range, it only takes a little sprint to deplete the stamina, leading to fairly slow and long treks to travel across the map. I literally wished there was some kind of auto-run functionality, as you're just pushing the forward button for minutes at a time on certain occasions with nothing else to do. A modular approach to difficulty, which is becoming more common in recent game releases, would have been preferable to set the challenge level of combat, travel, injuries and survival separately depending on the player's preferences.</p>
<p>There's more. The equipment's durability depletes over time, as you'd expect given the realistic theme. Tech NPCs can repair them in the safe zones, provided you've got enough coupons to spare. The problem is that, in some cases, the cost is simply outrageous. I had found an extremely effective armor suit that was worth over 20K coupons. However, when I went to repair it, I was appalled by the NPC requesting 70K coupons - far more than I had available. When repairing something costs over three times its worth, you know something's wrong. I also believe that the side missions could be more rewarding at handing coupons; you don't loot coupons from fallen foes, as they are transmitted digitally to your PDA. You could gather items and then sell them, but there's the little problem mentioned above with taking on too much weight. In short, the economy needs a balance pass, too.</p>
<p>Moreover, it might be helpful to allow players to wait time everywhere, even at the peril of hostile encounters. This is because the day/night cycle is slower than most open-world games, and at nighttime, it is sometimes nearly impossible to find things in certain quests. In one instance, I had to leave the game running while I waited for the sun to rise.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/stalker-2-campfire-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of gunplay, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is solid in this area, although not quite the best in the business. I noticed that weapon sounds do not always seem to play properly, sometimes giving a muffled sound to the bullets that was inappropriate for the weapon. A proper sound is critical to enjoying firing a gun, but it may have been a bug, so I won't dwell on this too much.</p>
<p>The game offers a leaning feature to poke around angles when in cover. You better use it with care, as it doesn't take long to die from gunshots, especially if you're playing on Medium or High difficulty, and the same is generally true for your foes. There's not a great amount of weapons, although that's understandable given the lore - there wouldn't be that many choices in the Zone. You can improve them with several attachments, though they're not that much of a common find.</p>
<p>As with everything, they require maintenance; a nearly-broken weapon could very well jam at the wrong time, leaving you at the mercy of your enemies. I did appreciate that being on the receiving end of a grenade not only damages Skif but also stuns him for a couple of seconds due to the explosion. Overall, the most interesting fights are those against other humans, as that's where the AI really shines, while encounters with mutants and especially animals may be more annoying than anything.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STALKER-2-Sunset-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The best part of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is easily the Zone and its exploration. The developers referred to the world as its own character in the review guide, and they were not wrong. All the design choices—even those that I consider currently unbalanced—certainly contribute to the feeling of the Zone as a huge, hostile, and hauntingly beautiful environment that players can explore without loadings from the get-go. But the atmosphere is also perfectly nailed down from both a visual and audio standpoint, providing maximum immersion in this post-apocalyptic setting.</p>
<p>Epic's Unreal Engine 5 renders the Zone with excellent fidelity, and Lumen doesn't disappoint even without the hardware ray tracing option that might be <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> post-launch. I did notice a little pop-in on the trees occasionally, probably because GSC did not use Nanite-powered trees, but it wasn't too distracting anyway. On the other hand, the repetitive visual appearance of most NPCs is a little distracting; the developers could have definitely done a better job in this regard, as in some cases you're left wondering if they're all genetically related.</p>
<p>Overall, performance was acceptable on my rig (7800X3D, RTX 4090) when playing at 4K, max settings, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution set to Balanced, and Frame Generation turned on (by the way, all upscalers are supported, including AMD FSR FG). There were a few stutters here and there, but compared to most of the UE games we've seen recently, it wasn't too problematic.</p>
<p>I did not have enough time to complete a full playthrough of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. That's partly because GSC only shared review codes a week ago for a game that lasts an average of 35 to 40 hours and partly because I encountered many bugs that slowed down my playthrough, even blocking progress to the main quest. Yes, this sequel is buggy, too. Perhaps not like the original, but not too far off, at least for the time being. GSC says they've fixed 1125 issues since sharing the review build, including the critical path bug that got me stuck for a couple of days. Still, it will clearly be an ongoing project for them post-launch for quite a while, which is not unexpected for such a big open-world game.</p>
<p>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Bethesda Game Studios revealed that Starfield has now <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1858930054572523833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 15 million players. The game had <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-13-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 13 million in December 2023 and 14 million this past <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June</a>. To celebrate the occasion, the team not only released a new patch (previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-1-14-74-reintroduces-uncapped-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-improves-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on the Steam beta build) that unlocks uncapped frame rates on Xbox, but they also released a free quest and vehicle.</p>
<p><em>As a special gift to our players for our 15 million player landmark, get ready to conquer the terrain of unexplored planets with the all-new Deimog, the latest addition to Starfield’s lineup of high-performance land vehicles. Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes. Its exceptional handling allows you to navigate even the trickiest terrain with ease, while a powerful rocket launcher ensures you’re prepared for any threats—be it hostile wildlife or clusters of enemies.</em></p>

<p>The new Starfield questline is centered around cooking:</p>
<p><em>In the spirit of Thanksgiving, The Perfect Recipe invites you on a heartwarming journey through Akila City, where the past and present collide in the hands of an unlikely dreamer. This character-driven questline introduces you to Harbhajan, a gifted mechanic with a hidden passion for the culinary arts. When you stumble upon a dusty recipe book during your travels, you learn it belongs to Harbhajan—a once-hopeful chef whose ambitions were set aside for a more practical life. Returning the recipes ignites a spark, rekindling old dreams of becoming a galaxy-renowned chef. But could it be too late for a second chance?</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield Creations: Perfect Recipe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/urwankF0m64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, following the request of the community, Creations released through the Verified Creators Program will have the option to be achievement-friendly. In simpler terms, they won't block achievements unlocked during your Starfield playthrough. Do note that Achievements won't retroactively unlock on previous game saves with Creations, even if those Creations are now achievement-friendly.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-worldwide-launch-shipments-could-be-in-the-7-million-units-range-%E2%80%93-rumor.1040487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launch could be one of the biggest to date, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gvm2fa/alleged_information_on_switch_2s_initial_shipment/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the same user who provided a basic sketch of the system last month on the Famiboards forums, which was sort of corroborated by more reliable insiders, provided some more information on the Nintendo Switch 2 launch stock, which was apparently recently finalized. The user couldn't disclose the exact number, but in the United States alone, the volume should be 2.5 times higher than the volume for the original system. If the 2.5 times increased volume will apply to worldwide shipments, Nintendo is planning to ship between 6.5 and 7 million units, which would indeed make it one of the biggest console launches of all time.</p>
<p>While we have to take the information shared today with a grain of salt, hearing that the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be massive isn't particularly surprising. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easy-find-stores/">Earlier this year</a>, we heard that 10 million units would be produced for the first fiscal year of availability, and Nintendo itself later confirmed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/">July</a> that the company was focused on producing enough units to meet demand and prevent scalpers from taking advantage of shortages like they did with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles, although the difficulty to find consoles in stores at launch was decisively made worse by other factors, including the pandemic.</p>
<p>As of now, very little is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 console, other than the fact that it will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward compatible</a> with its predecessor. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation Portal's latest firmware update, which went live a few hours ago, finally addresses one of the biggest issues that has impacted the system since its launch last year.</p>
<p>The 4.0 update, which also introduces the Cloud Streaming beta that expands the system's functionality by allowing PlayStation Plus Premium members to play select streaming games for PlayStation 5 on the console, also introduced some unspecified system software performance and stability improvements. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1gvjh1w/update_40_microstutter/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1gvmd5y/the_microstutter_issue_is_completely_gone_with/">online reports</a>, these improvements are far from being minimal, as with the new firmware update, Sony finally addressed the widely reported micro stuttering issues that the vast majority of users experienced on the PlayStation Portal since launch.</p>
<p>With a single firmware update, Sony managed to improve the system considerably, as the streaming quality issues and the lack of cloud gaming support were undoubtedly the PlayStation Portal's biggest issues that prevented it from being a much more appealing system. You can learn more about what the console did great right from launch in Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The PlayStation Portal isn’t quite the portable successor that players have been asking for from Sony since the decline of the PlayStation Vita. That being said, the PlayStation Portal does one job and does it exceedingly well. It might not reinvent the remote play experience, but for those relying on controller clips to mount a phone to the top of a DualSense controller or third-party controllers that use a mobile device as the display, an official Sony product just makes sense for a unified solution. It might not replace those Backbone controllers and other devices that players might have in their home, but the PlayStation Portal might wind up being the controller that players start reaching for first.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-extreme-overclocking-zelda-emulator/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A modded and overclocked Nintendo Switch console can become an excellent emulation machine, so much so that every entry in The Legend of Zelda series can be played on it, including two games whose remasters were long rumored to be in the works.</p>
<p>In a test video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> shows how an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-60-fps/">overclocked system</a> sporting double the RAM of the vanilla system, 8GB instead of 4GB, has no trouble running Wii U games such as The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Wind Waker and a few other titles, including New Super Mario Bros U, and epic Mickey 2. Interestingly enough, the modded and overclocked system also manages to run Zelda Wind Waker at 1440p resolution at an acceptable frame rate. Even more interesting to see is how the modded Nintendo Switch cannot run the Wii U version of Breath of the Wild, as the game freezes shortly after the beginning of the intro.</p>
<p><iframe title="CEMU on Nintendo Switch - 9 Games Tested" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7lKR1ohpFxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 still continuing to be shrouded in mystery, it is not surprising to see users try to create their own pro version of the original system to make the wait easier to bear. With 2024 almost over, it's almost certain that the first proper look at the new console will only be coming in 2025. The last we heard about the system was earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">this month</a>, with the confirmation that it will be backward compatible with the current system coming straight from Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa.</p>
