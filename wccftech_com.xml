			<p>Even though <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/">we've known the release date</a> for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X since <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom last month</a>, pre-orders were not live, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">before last night, we were still in the dark on price</a>. Well, now we know the price with the base Xbox Ally model coming in at $599 USD and the more powerful Xbox Ally X model listed at a whopping $999 USD. But even with those eye-watering prices, the handhelds are selling out across the globe, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>"<em>The hype is real!</em>" Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1971477401944326215">boasted in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>ROG Xbox Ally X preorders are sold out on the Xbox Store worldwide. You can still grab yours at asus.com/store/ or find a local retailer on xbox.com.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, it should be pointed out that this is just the first batch of pre-orders selling out. We don't necessarily know how many units Microsoft made available, so this isn't exactly a sign that the handheld is due to sell millions of units or anything like that when it launches next month.</p>



<p>But it is at least a clear sign that the early-adopting enthusiasts who are getting these pre-orders are not swayed by its price in the least. What happens after those enthusiasts all have their own, and how sales of the handhelds look within a year, will be the more telling figure.</p>



<p>Though these handhelds are made by ASUS, it's worth noting that Xbox-branded hardware hasn't exactly been selling well. Xbox Series X/S consoles have <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">reportedly sold only a little over 30 million units</a> since its launch five years ago, and new reports seem to confirm that Costco, the third-largest retailer in the world, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/">has stopped selling the consoles in its US and UK locations</a>. Costco Canada seems to carry them still, but you have to wonder how much longer that will last. </p>

			<p>Mars First Logistics is a physics-based sim-game developed by Shape Shop and published with support from Outersloth (the publishing and creator fund arm of <a href="https://wccftech.com/among-us-vr-release-window-trailer/">Among Us developer Innersloth</a>) that lets you build your own Mars rover to run around the red planet on. After more than two years of early access, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532200/Mars_First_Logistics/">officially out with the launch of its v1.0.</a></p>



<p>The game first launched in early access on June 22, 2023, and the v1.0 launch adds a new area for players to explore, 10 new endgame contracts, support for seven additional languages, new parts for your rovers, and more.</p>

<p>Beyond just building your own rover to trot around Mars on, you'll spend your time transporting various cargo across the face of the planet and trying not to topple over from the planet's awkward terrain on the way. You'll also make a home on Mars with your own shelter that you can build up and expand while you tinker and tweak your rover with well over 100 parts to mix and match.</p>



<p>It's a strong week for physics-based games, with Mars First Logistics' launch following the release of Baby Steps from the creators of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. Interestingly, Baby Steps was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">one of the indie titles that got out of Hollow Knight Silksong's way</a> when it was initially set to release just ahead of Silksong. Now, it's launched right next to a game that it actually has more direct competition with, as they're more aligned genre-wise. </p>

			<p>Now that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">is out and in players' hands</a>, besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/">another Metal Gear Solid game being remade</a>, what players are looking for next from Konami, is Vol. 2 of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection.</p>



<p>Which is why it wasn't a surprise that during the Metal Gear Production Hotline at Tokyo Game Show 2025, the topic of where Vol. 2 is and when we'll get to see it came up. Translated by <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">X (formerly Twitter) user Kuwabara357</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/">VGC</a>), series producer Noriaki Okamura stepped up to be the one to try and satisfy players curiosity, but could unfortunately only add that Konami is still working on it.</p>



<p>"<em>It has certainly taken quite a while now,</em>" Okamura began. "<em>Since we called the first installment 'Vol.1,' it's only natural to expect a second one, and that's what we said years ago.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But, as we've repeated several times, we are making it. We've been working on it properly while also producing Metal Gear Solid Delta. At the right timing, we'd like to share with you all not only about its progress but also the direction going forward. I'm sorry, it feels like I always have to say this, but please wait just a little longer. How long 'a little longer' actually means, well, it's hard to say.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But the project is moving forward properly, and we believe it's shaping up to be something enjoyable really. So please, wait just a bit more, more information is coming</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Vol. 1 of the Master Collection <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-release-october/">launched almost two years ago at the time of this writing</a>, and though, as Okamura points out, Konami has previously confirmed that a Vol. 2 is in the works, we've heard next to nothing about it, and which games will be included in the collection.</p>



<p>We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">seen rumours pointing to</a> Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain being the three games in the collection, but nothing concrete. If those are indeed the three titles going to be included, then it's not difficult for fans of the series to understand why Konami is taking its time with Vol. 2. </p>



<p>It's no small task to untangle MGS4 from the PlayStation 3's CELL architecture, which it was initially made on, and then improve it in all the ways players would expect from a game that's 17 years old now running on modern console and PC hardware. That said, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-latest-updates-bring-major-performance-improvements-for-metal-gear-solid-4-red-dead-redemption-and-persona-5/">RPCS3 figured out how to get MGS4 running on a PC years ago</a>. If they can do it, surely Konami can. </p>
