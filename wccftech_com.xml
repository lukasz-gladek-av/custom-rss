			<p>A new Ninja Gaiden 2 Black update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing additional content to the game, some balance changes, and more.</p>
<p>The 1.0.7.0 update, update 1.003.000 on PlayStation 5, introduces a New Game Plus mode, which allows players to go through a new game on a difficulty level they have previously completed with all the weapons and Ninpo that have been obtained in the previous playthrough. All weapons and spells levels, however, will be reverted to level one. The new update also adds a new Photo Mode and the ability to hide equipped projectile weapons.</p>
<p>Besides introducing new content and options, the new Ninja Gaiden 2 Black update also introduces some balance adjustments, such as lowering the HP of enemies in select chapters, increasing damage for some of Ayane's attacks, and several bug fixes. The full update notes can be found on the game's <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of one of the best action games ever released in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black isn't quite the definitive edition of Team NINJA's second entry in the series, but it comes close. While Ryu Hayabusa no longer faces overwhelming hordes of enemies, the game's intensity, deep combat mechanics, excellent enemy variety, greatly overhauled visuals, and solid level design make it one of the best ways to experience one of the finest action games ever released, performance issues notwithstanding.</em></p>

			<p>Crytek is the latest game developer in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly unending list</a> that is laying off a substantial portion (around fifteen percent) of its workforce. The announcement came this morning with the following message <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a>:</p>
<p><em>Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years. It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15% of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896. </em></p>
<p><em>While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services. </em></p>
<p><em>We firmly believe in the future of Crytek. With Hunt: Showdown 1896, we have a very strong gaming service and remain fully committed to its operation. We will continue to expand and evolve Hunt: Showdown 1896 with great content and drive our strategy for our engine CRYENGINE. </em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a new Crysis will be in the cards for several years. On the other hand, Hunt: Showdown fans will be happy to know the horror-themed first-person extraction shooter game continues to thrive following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big 1896 update,</a> which brought several technical improvements, such as DirectX 12 support, NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR support, HDR support, multi-bounce global illumination, and a full 3D audio pipeline. The game also <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-coming-to-xbox-gamepass-on-december-12-along-with-post-malones-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Xbox Game Pass</a> (on consoles) in December, opening up to a larger audience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, as part of their <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/app/uploads/2025/02/remedy-q4-2024-ir-presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-year 2024 financial report</a>, Remedy confirmed that Alan Wake 2 has finally surpassed two million units sold. As you might remember, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-2-forza-motorsport-alan-wake-2-npd-circana-october-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with sales</a> despite being critically acclaimed.</p>
<p>Remedy CEO Virtala also revealed that the development and marketing costs have finally been recouped, and the developer has begun earning royalties for Alan Wake 2 towards the end of the last quarter. The executive credited the game's continued support with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Springs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake House expansions</a>, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-alan-wake-2-patch-improves-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro update</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry update</a>, and of course the retail version of Alan Wake 2, for helping push the sales of the horror game, especially during the latest Holiday period.</p>
<p>Overall, revenue increased by 49.3% to â‚¬50 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Operating profit also improved compared to last year but remained negative. Still, Remedy is hopeful for the future, stating that 2025 will mark a new era of sustainable and stable growth. The Finnish developer has the ambitious goal of doubling the 2024 revenue by 2027 while retaining an EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) margin of 30%.</p>
<p>Following Alan Wake 2, Remedy is now fully committed to its next projects, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, which CEO Tero Virtala confirmed for a 2025 launch. The executive also said that in December, the development team successfully conducted a closed technical test with external players, testing the game's matchmaking and backend services and collecting data to shape the final game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control 2</a> has just entered full production after establishing production pipelines and verifying asset creation speed. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake</a> is also making 'steady progress' in full production, and it is now heading towards 'key objectives' that were agreed upon with publisher and IP owner Rockstar Games.</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least, Remedy is apparently also working on an unannounced project, as evidenced by the slide posted above. The studio hasn't shared any information yet, though, which suggests that it's at an early stage of development.</p>
