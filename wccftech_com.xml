			<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is going to offer something even for returning players who have completed the original PSX release or the Nintendo 3DS remake released back in 2016, a new ending that's never been seen before in any other version of the game.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Reimagined follows the narrative of the original story, but depending on some of the [...] player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before in previous iterations,"</em>  game producer Takeshi Ichikawa told Game Informer during the publication's recent visit to Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So, even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined."</em></p>



<p>While Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will follow the original narrative and add a new ending, the new version of the seventh entry in the series will<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"> feature significant gameplay changes that are set to improve the experience considerably</a>. Among these changes is a renewed battle system that will power more dynamic enemy encounters, evolved party members and enemy movesets and behaviours, the ability to skip combat against weak foes by attacking them on the field, a redesigned UI with a tab-based menu system for easy navigation, and more.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, which launches on February 5, 2026, is the next series' remake to launch on PC and consoles in recent times, following the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake and Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. The latter was released last week on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, introducing new features to the first two entries in the series that update the experience without taking away their classic feel. You can learn more about the latest series' remake by checking out <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">my review.</a></p>

			<p>A Steam Deck highly-requested feature has finally arrived with a new Beta Client update that went live a few hours ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/eventcomments/725769023703421533">The official November 4 Beta Client update notes</a> confirm that the system now features display-off low power downloads. This feature allows the Steam Deck to complete all active downloads in a new display-off mode before going to sleep. This feature is enabled by default when the system is plugged in to power, and can be toggled on and off by going into Settings and then Power.</p>



<p>The new Steam Deck Beta Client update also fixes a couple of additional issues, swuch as SteamOS updates failing to respect HTTP proxy configuration and regression where the performance graph wouldn't display while streaming.</p>



<p>The new Steam Deck display-off low-power downloads feature was further detailed in a dedicated blog post, which outlined the two ways to access the feature. The first way is to press the power button while the system is downloading content, which will bring up a new dialog box asking the user if they wish to continue downloading with the display off.</p>



<p>The second way is automatic, as the system will go into this mode after an idle timeout. Pressing a button after this happens will bring up a new status screen with the download progress, from where the user can either wake the system up completely or let it continue downloading in the new low power mode.</p>



<p>The new feature introduced in the latest Steam Deck Beta Client update is just one of the many improvements that have been added to the system launched in 2022, which helped kick-start the handheld PC gaming market. You can learn more about the portable system by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Kai Tatsumoto's review</a>. If you already own the system and want to make the most out of it, you should also consider the Chizha Mount Ling Dock, which&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-chizha-mount-ling-dock-review/">we reviewed last month.</a></p>

			<p>Following Nintendo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/">excellent quarterly and half-year results</a>, President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a 61-page document</a> with investors detailing the Japanese game and console manufacturer's strategy going forward.</p>



<p>Nintendo is mainly focused on keeping the momentum after the launch of the Switch 2 with a schedule filled with first-party releases, such as Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we just reviewed</a>), Kirby Air Riders, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, Pokémon Pokopia, and Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave. But Furukawa also boasted that the console offers the 'largest third-party software lineup for a new Nintendo hardware ever', increasing appeal for those gamers who aren't content with just first-party offerings.</p>



<p>Furukawa recognized that demand has exceeded the company's expectations in certain regions, resulting in ongoing shortages of Switch 2 systems. After apologizing for the inconvenience, he remarked that Nintendo will continue striving to deliver a stable supply of hardware.</p>



<p>With such a strong wind at their backs, it's no wonder Nintendo is now looking to reinvest in several key areas. One of those, according to the document, is the acquisition of game developers. This is not something that the Japanese company is particularly known for, although there have been a few exceptions, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-acquires-luigis-mansion-3-and-metroid-prime-federation-force-developer-next-level-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021's acquisition of Next Level Games</a>. </p>



<p>That studio had already partnered with Nintendo to make games like Luigi's Mansion 3. Should the same criteria be maintained in future acquisitions, possible targets could include Game Freak, HAL Laboratory, and Intelligent Systems, which have often worked on Nintendo IPs. When it comes to Western studios, the most likely option is MercurySteam, the Spanish developer that worked on two Metroid 2D games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-points-to-mandated-crunch-at-mercurysteam-metroid-dread-blades-of-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Its troubled financial situation</a> may prompt MercurySteam to accept such an offer.</p>



<ul>
<li><em>First is strengthening game development. We will work to strengthen the internal game development organization within the Nintendo group. This includes initiatives such as acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries and augmenting our development facilities, and the construction of Corporate Headquarters Development Center, Building No. 2 (tentative name).</em></li>



<li><em>Second is building software assets in non-game entertainment. Taking into account the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we will allocate funds to more actively pursue business opportunities that have an affinity with our game business, including but not limited to movies.</em></li>



<li><em>Third is the foundation for maintaining and expanding our relationships with consumers. We will utilize funds to maintain and expand our touchpoints with consumers, centered on the Nintendo Account system.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Furukawa also stated that funds will be dedicated to pursuing additional business opportunities to expand the company's assets beyond videogames. There's The Super Mario Galaxy Movie <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in April 2026</a>, not to mention the Zelda live action film scheduled to air <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-live-action-movie-slated-for-march-26-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 26, 2027</a>. Lastly, the Nintendo president aims to utilize the Nintendo Account, which has been created by more than 400 million people to date, to connect Nintendo with consumers and foster long-term relationships with them. </p>



<p>This multi-sided strategy appears to be the best approach to engage with both existing and new fans, although, of course, only time will tell whether it pans out as the company hopes.</p>

			<p>This morning, the official Nintendo Store app launched on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znej" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Play</a>. The app allows Nintendo fans to browse Nintendo systems, accessories, games, and merchandise. </p>



<p>Chief among the potential use cases is the ability to shop on the My Nintendo Store, browsing Nintendo Switch systems and accessories, physical and digital games, and other Nintendo products.</p>



<p>Players can also use the Nintendo Store app to stay up-to-date with the latest news on Nintendo games and events, as well as receive notifications about sales. The app allows users to enable push notifications, alerting them when items on their wish list go on sale.</p>



<p>Signing in with an existing Nintendo Account also lets users review their Nintendo Switch 2 and/or Nintendo Switch play activity. Those who owned a Nintendo 3DS or Wii U system may even view play activity logged before February 2020. To do so, though, they must link their Nintendo Network ID (NNID) to the new Nintendo Account. Lastly, fans can use the Nintendo Store app to check in at official Nintendo stores and events, earning related rewards. Their check-in activity will also be accessible within the app.</p>



<p>In other Nintendo news, the Switch 2 console is outpacing all forecasts. After just four months on the market, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has already sold 10.36 million units</a>, and the Japanese manufacturer now estimates it will reach 19 million units sold by the end of the fiscal year, which is set in March 2026.</p>
