			<p>In a recent appearance <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/11/17/gaming-is-americas-pastime-and-the-entertainment-business-of-the-future-says-take-two-ceo-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on CNBC's morning business news program Squawk Box</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that in the future, game characters will likely be AI-trained on human-made scripts to have more natural conversations with players, instead of being limited to the scripted interactions that the developers had foreseen when they envisioned the game. </p>



<p><em>Historically, we had to script every single action that a character engaged in, and because it is interactive, think about how much scripting that is. Now, we're always going to need great writers, and we always will have plenty of scripting, but characters should be able to be trained on that very scripting that has been created by great writers and then interact in a way that feels more natural. I do see that happening.</em></p>



<p>Could that be one of the major new features that Rockstar Games has prepared for Grand Theft Auto VI, now officially one year away from its launch (provided there are no further delays)? Just two days ago, a new rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-is-likely-to-be-unmatched-for-almost-two-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surfaced</a> about the game featuring extremely ambitious features that may remain unmatched for 'decades'.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether a similar feature makes it in GTA VI or not, the technology is absolutely here now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA ACE</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-and-nvidia-demonstrate-on-device-ai-character-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inworld AI</a> already offer something like that, where game characters can respond to natural conversations depending on what they should be aware of. </p>



<p>Zelnick's comment, however, comes at a time when there's a lot of tension on the usage of AI in the industry. Black Ops 7 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized for its 'AI slop' assets</a>, while ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came under fire for using generative AI to voice NPCs</a>. On that subject, the developers behind the highly successful episodic adventure game Dispatch <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told GamesIndustry</a>:</p>



<p><em>You're not going to be surprised because it's built on something you've heard before if you go the AI route. So, yeah, honestly, AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you aren't creative.</em></p>



<p>Of course, when discussing AI, there's much more beyond just empowering game characters or voicing them. As part of his reply on CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick also highlighted that the company is using the technology to create 'efficiencies', which, however, won't reduce the headcount but will instead let them focus on creative tasks.</p>



<p><em>Table stakes are creating more efficiency in development and marketing, and every enterprise is trying to do that. We're trying to do that and we're seeing some good early results in creating efficiencies. By the way, efficiencies is not code for reducing employment, it's code for taking away mundane tasks so people can focus on more interesting, creative tasks. </em></p>



<p>That is, after all, the sentiment behind many other AI statements we covered recently, from <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ricard Pillosu</a>. Perhaps, though, it was Dean Hall who, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dayz-creator-says-ai-fears-remind-him-people-worrying-about-google-wikipedia-ai-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to Wccftech</a>, really got to the heart of the issue:</p>



<p><em>I think that regardless of what we do, AI is here. So really, then, it's about a matter of how do we deal with what the impact of that is.</em></p>

			<p>At least one of Bungie's ongoing legal troubles has been put to rest, as the company settles a copyright lawsuit it was facing against author Matthew Kelsey Martineau, who alleged Bungie had pulled storylines for its Red War campaign in Destiny 2 and the Red Legion from his work published on WordPress between 2013 and 2014.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/author-sues-bungie-for-copyright-infringement-over-destiny-2s-story">Martineau sued Bungie last year</a> for the alleged copyright infringement, and you'd be forgiven if you thought this would have been a simple case for Bungie to dismiss. In its motion to dismiss, Bungie refuted Martineau's claim, saying he "<em>failed to plausibly allege that Bungie copied constituent elements of Plaintiff's work that are original, and, specifically, that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege factual copying by Bungie and that the works incorporated by reference into the Complaint are not substantially similar as a matter of law</em>."</p>



<p>However, to Bungie's chagrin, Judge Susie Morgan did not dismiss the case. Bungie was unable to demonstrate direct examples from the Destiny 2 Red War campaign to prove its argument, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-content-removed-vault-beyond-light-november/">because that content has since been vaulted</a>. Not only is it no longer available to the public, but it's no longer compatible with the current foundation of Destiny 2.</p>



<p>To make that content available would be a mountain of an engineering effort, so when Bungie tried instead to resort to YouTube videos of old Destiny 2 gameplay footage and Destiny 2 wiki content, Judge Morgan disallowed it as evidence. "<em>While Plaintiff does reference Destiny 2 in his complaint, he does not reference the YouTube videos containing Destiny 2 game footage, the Destinypedia pages, or the Tyson declaration</em>," Judge Morgan wrote at the time.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">So Bungie's dismissal attempt failed</a>, and the case entered an extended discovery process, which allowed Martineau to further expand his arguments and, eventually, as reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/">The Game Post</a>, reach a settlement.</p>



<p>"<em>A settlement conference was conducted on this date before the undersigned Magistrate Judge</em>," the new filing reads. "<em>Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims. The Court thanks counsel and the parties for their efforts in bringing this matter to an amicable resolution</em>."</p>



<p>The public settlement filing doesn't include details on what the conditions of the agreement were, if Martineau was awarded a monetary sum or if a deal was reached another way, but as far as the court is concerned, this is a closed case so long as the settlement terms are met by both parties and agreed upon for the next 60 days, which is the period of time given in case either side wants to open the case back up.</p>



<p>At least this is one less thing for Bungie to worry about now, as it continues trying to pick itself up amidst Destiny 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/">reportedly selling very poorly</a>.</p>
