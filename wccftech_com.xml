			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-will-speed-onto-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-and-pc-in-fall-2025/">Project Motor Racing</a> developer Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software have announced that the upcoming sim racing game will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 25, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer showcases Project Motor Racing's career mode and the intricacies involved in how Straight4 Studios is simulating the career of a professional racer, where winning isn't always the most important thing. It's being able to afford the next race, win or lose.</p>
<p>"<em>We wanted to capture the harsh reality of pro motorsport</em>," said the game design director at Straight4 Studios, Austin Ogonoski, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Budgets, repairs, sponsors. Failed overtakes that don't just wreck your car but your whole season. Your career in Project Motor Racing is motorsport with consequences</em>."</p>
<p>The career mode will have you negotiating sponsorships, what you can afford to build out your car, and the choice between giving it your all in each race versus making sure you'll have a car to race with for the next one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the release date and the introduction of the career mode, publisher GIANTS Software also confirms that the game will launch with full modding support on day one.</p>
<p>The game is being built with the GIANTS Engine, and as the company's head of publisher, Boris Stefan put it in a press release, "<em>Project Motor Racing taps into the same powerhouse modding ecosystem as Farming Simulator. Racing modders will be able to tweak, tune, and transform their experience however they like.</em>"</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now available for Project Motor Racing on all platforms.</p>
