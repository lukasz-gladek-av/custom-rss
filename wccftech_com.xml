			<p>A good portion of the Battlefield 6 open beta PC players were on or below minimum specs, but the game's development team made sure all players could enjoy the open beta properly, regardless of their system configuration.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dev-says-a-significant-number-of-users-played-the-game-below-the-minimum-recommended-specs-as-ea-points-to-the-importance-of-weaker-hardware">Eurogamer</a>, technical director Christian Buhl confirmed that of the millions of players who joined the Battlefield 6 open beta, a substantial number of them were on minimum specs or below. The team, however, wasn't caught unprepared, as they went to great lengths to ensure the open beta and the game would be playable on a wide range of system configurations, making sure maps were performant enough to hit certain performance targets regardless of the hardware. "<em>Min spec is certainly one of our most important spec, it's super important from both a commercial and business perspective - we want as many people as possible playing the game,"</em> Buhl added.</p>



<p>With the rising costs of living and PC hardware, Battlefield 6 running well on low-end hardware is welcome, although it remains to be seen if the remainder of the game will run as nicely as the open beta did. Some players will get the chance to test this out themselves before the game launches in a little over a month, as another round of testing via <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battlefield-labs-playtesting-resumes/">Battlefield Labs</a> is planned to test some of the changes coming to the game based on beta feedback, new maps like Operation Firestorm, and server browsing.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on October 10 worldwide.</p>
