			<p>The new Oblivion Remastered patch released <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-patch-1-2-reduce-stutters/">earlier this week</a> brings some performance improvements over the previous version of the game, but the game is still very far from being in an optimal state, as even hgih-end hardware struggles running the game at high native resolutions without Frame Generation.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by MxBenchmarkPC compares the 1.2 version of the game with the launch version, highlighting how the performance improvements promised in the patch notes are indeed noticeable, but the overall situation is still not optimal. In a GPU-limited scenario on an RTX 5080, with NVIDIA DLSS in quality mode, ultra settings, and no Frame Generation, one of the most powerful GPUs on the market struggles to hit the 60 FPS mark at 4K resolution, and the 70 FPS mark at 1440p resolution, but even in a CPU-limited scenario, performance is far from being optimal, given the hardware. Things don't fare any better at native resolution, as the game runs at barely above 30 FPS at native 4K resolution, and in the 40s FPS range with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode. To hit anything past the 60 FPS mark, Oblivion Remastered needs Frame Generation, which is baffling, considering the GPU the game is running on, but sadly not surprising, considering the remake of the fourth entry in the series is most definitely not the only game powered by Unreal Engine 5 that doesn't run well on PC.</p>

<p>After being rumored to be in the works for a while, Oblivion Remastered was finally revealed and launched this April. Although the shift in atmosphere may be difficult to ignore for some players, and the performance leaves a lot to be desired, the new version of the classic RPG by Bethesda is one worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>
