			<p>Posted by <a href="https://x.com/Stiven_SRB/status/1853933258112712918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1853933258112712918%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user Stiven_SRB on X</a>, it's alleged that there is a Warcraft II Remaster in the works. Normally, it would be advised to take these sorts of posts with a huge pinch of salt, but due to the fact that Stiven frequently datamines Blizzard Games as a hobby, with people who are fans of the Blizzard Games seeming to rely heavily on the information released by him. It's also been leaked as of late that there are some huge updates coming for Warcraft III: Reforged, a game that has been quite controversial in the Warcraft community due to how it was handled and seemingly forgotten about. However, the Warcraft universe's 30th anniversary is fast approaching, with a special presentation taking place on <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-universe-turns-30-gets-anniversary-direct-on-november-13/">November 13</a>. This is where people will hear about content coming from World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Warcraft Rumble, as listed on the Blizzard Entertainment website. However, they have said there are plenty of surprises in store, so it's possible that this includes news to do with either Warcraft III or Warcraft II.</p>
<p>While the post from Stiven didn't offer much, he posted it with four pictures, which are supposed to be the key art of the game, including the logo for Warcraft II Remastered. If this is true, it seems that they will be learning from the mistakes that were made with Warcraft III: Reforged, as that game was meant to be a complete reimagining of the classic game. Warcraft III: Reforged wasn't all bad, and the gameplay improved, but for the most part, people didn't like the graphics of the new game.</p>
<p>If the news of a Warcraft II Remaster is true, it'll be interesting to see how they tackle the graphics and whether they will keep the graphics true to the original, which was originally released in 1995. The game went on to have some expansion backs, which led to a compilation of the game with the expansions named Warcraft II: The Dark Saga. However, it wasn't long ago that they added Warcraft II to Battle.net, allowing people to purchase it in the Battle.net shop. It's also available through GOG for those who want the classic experience. Because they've now made the original accessible, it seems a little bit more uncertain about how they will tackle a remaster of Warcraft II, or whether it's even in progress at Blizzard Entertainment in the first place.</p>

			<p>Despite the Harry Potter franchise being incredibly dated at this point, it still has a considerable fanbase. As a result, more and more content within the IP continues to be released, with Hogwarts Legacy being one of the latest endeavors of Warner Bros. Not only have there been books, games, and movies, they are now branching out into a TV show, which is due to debut on HBO in 2026. However, it turns out that Warner Bros. has made Hogwarts Legacy a 'huge priority.' It's no surprise that Hogwarts Legacy ended up being the top-selling game of 2023 and has sold over 30 million units as of last month. With the success of Hogwarts Legacy, they've also released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions and a remaster of the Lego Harry Potter games.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery's Chief Financial Officer has said that a direct sequel to Hogwarts Legacy is a goal for the development team moving forward. "Obviously, a successor to Hogwarts Legacy is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road," says WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-game-warner-bros-1236130719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> at the Bank of America's 2024 Media, Communications &amp; Entertainment Conference. Although Hogwarts Legacy was quite successful, that doesn't mean that every game recently released by Warner Bros. has been. The most recent big release for the studio was Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and that did not sell very well at all. It's been considered a "miss" by the company, and it seems that they are pivoting heavily into more Harry Potter content.</p>
<p>While they have released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, it's worth noting that this game is in no way a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy, and is treated as it's own standalone title. However, it's been confirmed by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Haddad</a>, the President of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, that they are looking for ways to produce content within the Wizarding World.</p>
<p>"We have known for some time that fans are looking for more things in this world, and so we're spending a lot of time thinking about that. Our insights tell us that there are not huge distinctions between a younger version of a fan and an older version of a fan. They're just deep Harry Potter fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this IP belongs to J.K. Rowling, it's been confirmed that she is not involved with the management of the franchise but is instead receiving updates via her literary agent. It's been stated that the game development team behind Hogwarts Legacy has been working on some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the sequel, with the storylines set to play out in the Harry Potter HBO TV series. Whether this means they are directly linked and are considered a canon event seems a little bit up in the air right now.</p>
<p>Harry Potter doesn't seem to be dying any time soon, with experiences being opened in the Universal Theme Park, new games consistently being in development or released, and many new ways to create content. Hogwarts Legacy is set to get a<a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/"> remastered version</a> in the future, adding extra content for players to explore.</p>
