			<p>When it comes to keeping user comfort and health a priority, <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">HBADA takes the lead</a>, as their commitment to bringing ergonomic design through cutting-edge technology and advanced material is well-known in the industry. Its ongoing efforts in establishing technological leadership and improving ergonomics are attributed to 16 years of experience in finding customer-centric solutions and marking their professionalism and products in the industry. With over 10 million global users, the company definitely doesn’t need any introductions.</p>
<p>All of this intense experience is reflected through its latest HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair, which supports longer sitting durations and is the perfect choice for those looking for a blend of style and comfort.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is designed to promote a healthier lifestyle and is packed with features that make it stand out. Some of its key specs include:</p>
<h3>T-Shape Support System for Better Posture</h3>
<p>The HBADA E3 Office Chair has a T-shaped support structure that is meant to address the three pain points generally experienced during prolonged sitting: waist, neck, and shoulders. This helps in aligning and correcting posture by offering extended support to the lumbar regions.</p>
<h3>3-Zone Elastic Lumbar Support</h3>
<p>When users sit for longer durations, lower back pain seems inevitable, and the industry is continuously working on addressing this issue. HBADA has led in this category with its Three-Zone Elastic Lumbar Support, which can rotate both inward and outward and adjust to all body types and sizes, which can help reduce strain experienced during extensive sitting due to the support that tends to imitate the natural curve of the body.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>4D Headrest with Dual-Axis Neck Pillow</h3>
<p>Not only does it cater to the <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">back issues that 9-5 workers and gamers</a> generally tend to experience during work or gaming, but it also addresses neck pain issues by providing proper support that helps relieve cervical pressure. The dual-axis rotation of 70 degrees and the option to adjust the pillow both vertically and horizontally help distribute the pressure and allow for comprehensive neck support.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>6D Mechanical Armrest</h3>
<p>The armrest also offers the option to adjust the seating by adjusting the height, depth, and angles at about six different degrees. This freedom helps reducing the strain on shoulders and maintaining proper posture during work, gaming, or even leisure time by providing elbow and forearm support.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>High Elastic Mesh Fabric</h3>
<p>Not only is the option to adjust the armrest and offer lumbar support one of the selling points of the E3 chair, but the material used also makes it truly stand out. The high elastic mesh fabric is breathable and allows for airflow, which helps keep users feeling cool and comfortable, especially during longer periods of sitting. The fabric is easy to maintain and offers durability as it does not easily wear and tear.</p>
<h3>AUTO Gravity-Sensing Chassis</h3>
<p>The best thing about the HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is that there is minimal need to make adjustments manually. The chassis automatically adjusts the recline according to the user's body weight and posture and distributes weight evenly for comfortable sitting. The recline function is extensive, as it can adjust to 140 degrees, making it ideal for supporting full-body rest.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In 2024, HBADA E3 Office Chair was awarded the prestigious French Design Award – Gold Award. The 16 years that HBADA team has served in the industry not only helps it establish itself as a global technology leader but also pushes it to continuously deliver optimal health-driven solutions that actually improve lifestyle. The company also carries a number of certifications, including the German IGR Ergonomics Certification, and also collaborates with the American ICA Chiropractic Association doctors.</p>
<p>Whether you work from home, looking to update your office chairs, or just want a solidly built chair that supports your gaming activity, look no further because the E3 Ergonomic Chair brings it all at an affordable price. The HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is perfect for an office or home setting, as its ergonomic design helps promote good posture and reduce perpetual strain on the body. Considering the longterm benefits it delivers, this may be the upgrade you need in your life to save your neck and lower back from longterm damage. The E3 comes in 3 color options, including Gray, Black, and Pink. HBADA E3 is available on <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" rel="sponsored noopener">both the official store</a> and via <a href="https://amzn.to/4dkttNO" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon</a>.</p>

			<p>PlayStation 5 Pro patches for the two games released so far on the base model by Insomniac introduce graphical toggles that allow users to customize their experience further in the vein of PC gaming.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro patches for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which both went live today, introduce new Performance Pro and Fidelity Pro modes, which provide, respectively, 60 FPS gameplay with the same image quality of the standard fidelity mode through PSSR and all ray tracing features, and 30 FPS gameplay and new ray tracing features, which can be tuned individually to reach higher intermediate frame rates when using VRR and 120 Hz Display mode.</p>
<p>The new ray tracing options introduced by the PlayStation 5 Pro Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart patch are RT Reflections and RT Ambient Occlusion, while Marvel's Spider-Man gets RT Key Light Shadows, which uses ray tracing to calculate sun shadows at mid- to distance, replacing cascaded shadow maps, RT Reflections and Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. More details on the patches and the new options they introduce can be found <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344384505101-Version-1-005-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Rift Apart and <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344021452941-Version-1-004-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>The two Insomniac-developed games aren't the only ones that received PlayStation 5 Pro patches ahead of the system's release on November 7th. Other games that were already patched include <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-ps5-pro-patch/">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing/">Alan Wake 2.</a></p>
