			<p>Rockstar co-founder and one of the most instrumental creatives behind series like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, Dan Houser, has had a lot to say about generative AI lately. As Houser continues to participate in interviews as part of promoting his new book, <a href="https://wccftech.com/american-caper-a-better-paradise-gta-creator-dan-houser-absurd-ventures/">A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath</a>, his latest comments on generative AI are not aimed at the technology itself, but at the people pushing for its use in all situations.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VirginRadioUK/videos/851083790630384/">The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on Virgin Radio UK</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gta-writer-dan-houser-says-the-people-leading-the-push-for-ai-are-not-the-most-humane-or-creative-people/">VGC</a>), when Houser was asked about generative AI, he agreed that it would never be able to replace human creativity, as he's said before, and further added, "<em>Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI are not the most humane or creative people</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>They're sort of saying, 'we're better at being human than you are,' and it's obviously not true. One of the other things we're trying to capture is that humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people who maybe aren't fully rounded humans.</em>"</p>



<p>Evans followed up by asking if Houser believes that generative AI, in its current state and in the future, will be the massive success that executives who are pushing for its use believe it will be. "<em>As far as I understand it, I personally don't think it will</em>," Houser began. </p>



<p>"<em>Because I think AI is eventually going to eat itself, because as I understand it - which is really a superficial understanding - the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models, so it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease. I can't see how the information gets better if they're already running out of data. It will do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly."</em></p>



<p>Recently, Houser said that <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creator-reveals-favorite-character-says-llms-will-be-good-at-cheap-stuff-not-magic/">he's "<em></em><em>less scared than a lot of people</em>," with regard to the question of generative AI technology replacing humans</a>, particularly in creative roles. "<em>I think you're going to end up with a lot of work that looks the same. It's going to help people be creative in some ways. It's going to get some people who probably shouldn't be in that space out of that space. But if you've got talent, I think it'll be fine. I don't think they're going to come up with magic. I think they're going to be fantastic at coming up with really cheap, decent stuff.</em>"</p>
