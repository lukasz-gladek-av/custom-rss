<p>2K and Hangar 13 are putting the finishing touches on Mafia: The Old Country ahead of the imminent launch. The game will be the first new entry in the franchise since 2016's Mafia III, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-iii-fastest-selling-game-2ks-history-reviews-anomaly/">sold</a> relatively well but was not at all well received among fans. Afterward, they released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a> in 2020, a remake of the original game.</p>



<p>The first rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-mafia-4-will-follow-the-story-of-don-salieri-in-sicily/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared</a> in 2022, when insider ShpeshalNick said the new game would follow the story of Don Salieri's rise in Sicily. The insider was right about the setting<span>&nbsp;but not about the protagonist, but we'll dive into that later. The development team officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-is-in-early-development-at-hangar-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of a new game project&nbsp;</span>later that year, during the twentieth anniversary celebrations of the Mafia IP. But it wasn't until two years later, at Gamescom 2024, that Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-mafia-the-old-country-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Mafia: The Old Country - Release date, platforms, pricing, editions<br></h2>

<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, setting, and story premise<br></h2>



<p>As suggested earlier, the rumors were correct about Hangar 13 going back to the roots of the organization. Mafia: The OId Country takes place around 1900 in Sicily, Italy, in the fictional town of San Celeste, which was previously seen in Mafia II.</p>



<p>However, the protagonist won't be a younger Don Salieri. Instead, players will step into the shoes of Enzo Favara, a young man who spent his adolescence being forced to work in the island's sulfur mines. Now that he has a chance to prove himself to the rising Torrisi crime family, he will do anything in his power to hold on to this opportunity and defend the Torrisi from rival families who would want to see them fall.</p>



<p>The development team stressed the importance of delivering authenticity when recreating turn-of-the-20th-century Sicily, and it isn't just talk, either. They partnered with Stormind (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remothered-tormented-fathers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remothered: Tormented Fathers</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remothered-broken-porcelain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/batora-lost-haven-bathing-in-shadows-to-reach-dim-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batora: Lost Haven</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>), which is based in Catania, Sicily, to ensure that.</p>



<p>Genre-wise, this is shaping up to be a fairly straightforward third-person single player action/adventure game. </p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>In the words of Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes, Mafia: The Old Country is both a return to the roots of the franchise and a step forward. He's referring to the fact that the game won't feature a plethora of side content like the full-fledged open world Mafia III. That said, The Old Country will be completely linear and won't offer an open world at all, whereas even the original Mafia allowed exploration of the city of Lost Heaven, despite the lack of anything truly meaningful to do. So, do not expect to be able to explore as much as in the previous games. This time around, Hangar 13 is betting everything on delivering a powerful, cinematic narrative.</p>



<p>Of course, this is no walking simulator. There will be plenty of action between story beats, with players engaging in tense life-or-death fights up close with a blade or from afar with various firearms, including authentic period handguns, rifles, and shotguns. There's third-person cover-based gunplay, too. Stealth is also very much a tool in Enzo Favara's arsenal, provided he can get close enough to perform a takedown move. In fact, Hangar 13 said they designed the game around a certain scarcity of resources, so being tactical with the approach to fights is highly recommended.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country is set in a variety of Sicilian landscapes, ranging from underground crypts and crumbling ruins to lush vineyards and opulent opera houses. Travel between point A and B can happen on horseback or while driving in authentic turn-of-the-century cars, and the trailers have already shown that these segments can include combat, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-mafia-the-old-country-pc-system-requirements">Mafia: The Old Country PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>The new Mafia game is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology, in a shift from the proprietary Fusion Engine seen in Mafia III and Mafia: Definitive Edition (itself an evolution of Mafia II's Illusion Engine). </p>



<p>PC store pages have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/">listed</a> the following minimum and recommended PC system requirements for Mafia: The Old Country:</p>
