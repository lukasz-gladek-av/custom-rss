			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as miHoYo) <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that United States players will have to verify their age soon to continue playing the game. Here's the brief message shared with the community:</p>
<p><em>Dear Travelers，</em><br>
<em>We are required by law to age verify US player accounts. The age verification process will be rolled out to all US players by May 20th while login (if already have one) or account registration.</em><br>
<em>Please ensure to provide your age information by July 18th, 2025. Failure to verify will result in:</em><br>
<em>- Account suspension</em><br>
<em>- In-game friends and chat records will be deleted</em><br>
<em>- No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law</em><br>
<em>If the verification is not completed by July 20th, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</em></p>
<p>This appears to be a direct consequence of a recent <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a>, which had charged HoYoverse with deceiving minors into spending for their loot boxes. The Chinese developer was subsequently banned from selling them to users under 16 without a parent's express consent, paid a $20 million fine to the FTC, and was also subject to the following stipulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibited from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option for consumers to purchase them directly with real money;</li>
<li>Prohibited from misrepresenting loot box odds, prices and features;</li>
<li>Required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency;</li>
<li>Required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 unless they obtain parental consent to retain such data; and</li>
<li>Required to comply with COPPA, including its notice and consent requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said at the time:</p>
<p><em>Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning. Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions.</em></p>
<p>The popular free-to-play action RPG <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is being updated today to patch 5.6</a>. Dubbed 'Paralogism', it features two new characters, the five-star support character Escoffier and the four-star DPS character Ifa. There is also a new Archon Quest, a new Story Quest, and a new Boss fight, among other additions to Genshin Impact.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-ally-2-and-%E2%80%98project-kennan%E2%80%99-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak.1182918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A combination of leaks has provided the first look at the Asus ROG Ally 2 and the Xbox-branded handheld codenamed Project Kennan. Indonesian publication 91Mobiles <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a certification for a new ASUS handheld at the local certification company for two different models: the RC73XA and the RC73YA.</p>
<p>With the model numbers, this was subsequently linked <a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919936711423135892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Twitter user Huang514613</a> to a United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing that included pictures of both models. The white one seems to be the regular Asus ROG Ally 2, while the black one appears to feature an Xbox button and could therefore be the Xbox branded handheld.</p>

<p>The same Twitter user also <a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919970354363064533" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> some of the specifications from the back labels. The RC73YA should be equipped with <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-preps-faster-aerith-plus-soc-higher-clocks-lpddr5x-possibly-for-steam-deck-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's AERITH Plus</a>, a 4-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and up to 20 watts of TDP. The RC73XA, on the other hand, is reportedly more powerful, being equipped with the Ryzen Z2 Extreme, an 8-core CPU, 32GB of RAM, and up to 35 watts of TDP.</p>
<p>There have been rumors that Asus <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had partnered with Microsoft</a> to make an&nbsp;<span>Xbox-branded handheld. Later, Asus teased that they were 'cooking' something new, and the Xbox social channel&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-keenan-teases-asus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replied</a> with a not-at-all-subtle</span>&nbsp;meme hinting that it would be about Xbox.</p>
<p>This portable device made in collaboration with Asus will be just a stepping stone in Microsoft's handheld plans. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent report</a> by Windows Central, a proper Microsoft-made Xbox handheld will debut in 2027 alongside the successor to the Xbox Series X, featuring direct-to-cloud connectivity, among other things.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in a talk at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem Jason Ronald <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-will-offer-the-best-of-console-and-pc-put-together-says-microsoft-more-info-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated </a>that the goal of the future Xbox handheld is to combine the best of the console (Xbox) and PC (Windows) ecosystems for an optimal user experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Split Fiction has had a "<em>hugely successful launch</em>" according to <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">EA</a>, as the latest co-op adventure from Hazelight Studios nears&nbsp;<strong>4 million copies sold</strong>. The game was highlighted by EA in its wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year, and counted as a key part of what led to a "<em>strong finish</em>" for the year alongside EA Sports FC 25.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios followed up the news from the financial report with a post on its official <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892">X</a> account, saying "<em>4 million sold! So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it's amazing...Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight. And so many hot dogs made...</em>"</p>
<p>Hazelight's previous title and game of the year winner in 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two,</a> surpassed <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies sold in March 2025</a>. Split Fiction has a long way to go to reach that milestone, but it certainly seems like it's on its way there.</p>
<p>Just last week, we learned that the previously announced Split Fiction movie will star Sydney Sweeney as one of the two female leads. It's not yet known which of the two she will play or who will join her as a co-star. Wicked director Jon M. Chu has signed on to direct the adaptation, with Deadpool &amp; Wolverine writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese penning the script.</p>
<p>Along with confirming the sales milestone for Split Fiction, EA's wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year confirmed that the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">Battlefield</a> game will be revealed this summer and that it will release sometime before April 2026. The next Skate game is also set to release during that same period.</p>

			<p>EA announced in its latest <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">financial report</a> for Q4 of its 2025 fiscal year that the next Battlefield game will be fully revealed sometime this summer and will launch before the end of its 2026 fiscal year, ending April 2026. It also confirmed that the highly anticipated return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-skate-game-wont-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-multiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox/">Skate</a> will arrive sometime in this fiscal year ending April 2026.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Andrew Wilson highlighted the release and reveal of Battlefield, calling it "<em>a pivotal step</em>" as the company moves forward in this fiscal year.</p>
<p>"<em>As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline</em>," Wilson said. "<em>Beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment</em>."</p>
<p>Later in the report, EA states that it expects its revenue for its 2026 fiscal year to be driven by "<em>the EA Sports portfolio, The Sims, and the launches of Battlefield and Skate.</em>" Previously, EA announced that the new Skate game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">released in early access sometime this year</a>. We've yet to see an official release date.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-will-add-more-players-to-battlefield-labs-playtesting-this-month-across-europe-north-america-and-asia/">EA provided a development update</a> for the new Battlefield game and its Battlefield Labs playtesting, where it confirmed that players in Asia will begin to be invited, and that the playtest will grow in scale over May to invite more players to participate and introduce new content.</p>
