			<p><span>FromSoftware has just&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its new game, Elden Ring Nightreign, has already registered over two million players on its launch day. On Steam, it has peaked at 313K concurrent players, and it could certainly get higher during the weekend.</span></p>
<p>On one hand, this is entirely unsurprising since it's the spin-off of a game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-units-after-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over 30 million copies to date (and is now getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie</a>, too). On the other hand, Nightreign is inevitably an experiment to some degree, and its formula wasn't exactly guaranteed to be equally attractive. Indeed, critic scores were a bit lower than usual for the Japanese studio. However, our Francesco De Meo still enjoyed his time with the game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his 9/10 review</a> published earlier this week:</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</em></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've heard next to nothing about the Splinter Cell Remake since Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/">confirmed the remake was coming</a> after years of waiting for Ubisoft to even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-were-working-on-splinter-cell-comeback/">say that they are bringing the series back</a>.</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">a sly comment</a> from the managing director at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio that's leading development on the Splinter Cell Remake, amounted to Ubisoft saying they had nothing to say at the time. That was the last time we heard anything directly from Ubisoft about the coming remake.</p>
<p>Today, however, Splinter Cell was brought up again, through the company's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1928421132438224990">account on X</a>. The post is just a photo of Sam Fisher, not from the original 2002 game, but from 2005's Chaos Theory, captioned with emoticons making a face and a Splinter Cell hashtag.</p>
<p>The image's alt-text reads "<em><span>Close-up of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background. He's locked in.</span></em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and interestingly, Ubisoft is not included in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">image showcasing the partners for this year's show</a>. Keighley also claimed that this year's show has 60+ partners, but the image and the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/">website</a> only list 57. This was likely purposeful, for Ubisoft to announce its involvement in Summer Game Fest separately with a yet-to-be-announced Ubisoft Forward event sometime during the SGF weekend.</p>
<p>That's all just speculation, but with how vocal Splinter Cell fans have been about asking for a return of the series, the company has to be acutely aware of the impact even mentioning Splinter Cell has. It's not likely that Sam Fisher would show up a week ahead of SGF if Ubisoft didn't have something to show regarding the Splinter Cell Remake.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll get an announcement soon that Ubisoft does have something Splinter Cell Remake-related to show.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-nobunaga%E2%80%99s-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-q-a.1202634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Koei Tecmo's only Nintendo Switch 2 launch game is NOBUNAGA’S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition, an improved version of the game that launched in July 2023 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. Awakening was the sixteenth installment in the popular series of turn-based grand strategy games. Ahead of that game's launch, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-preview-and-qa-with-director-ryu-michi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Koei Tecmo's producer and director Michi Ryu.</p>
<p>The Complete Edition (which will also be available on Sony's PlayStation 5 console) features DLC from the original title as well as six new scenarios along with climactic Decisive Battles. Players will be able to launch joint offenses with allies, break through the frontlines en route to enemy castles, and appoint officers to influence both political and economic strategies while experiencing life as a daimyo in the troubled times of the Warring States Period (16th-century Japan).</p>
<p>With the game's debut scheduled for next week, we contacted Michi Ryu once again to discuss specifically the Nintendo Switch 2 version of NOBUNAGA’S&nbsp; AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition. The game will be available on June 5 as part of the Switch 2's launch lineup.</p>
<p><iframe title="NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvZG8Jiz7oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you first receive your Nintendo Switch 2 development kit?</strong></p>
<p>I can't give you a concrete answer, so I'll leave it to your imagination (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>How long has this version been in development, and what do you think about the new platform's ease of development?</strong></p>
<p>While I can't disclose the exact timeframe, we had previously released the Nintendo Switch version, so porting to Nintendo Switch 2 was possible to achieve within a small team in a short period.&nbsp; Besides the porting, we have also worked on adding new hardware features and preparing game content updates, so overall, it took a considerable amount of time. Developing on this new platform feels the same as the Switch, which makes the process easier. However, there are always some challenges when launching a game (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion?</strong></p>
<p>The platform has evolved in many ways. There are many interesting aspects, but in terms of strategy games, the possibility of being able to use the Joy-Con 2 as a mouse might be the most notable one. Although we think that using the controller to play is more than enough, it's undeniable that a mouse, which allows more intuitive control, is better suited for this genre. Being able to accomplish this through hardware features is a significant advantage.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of raw computing power, is it closer to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox Series S?</strong></p>
<p>Since the "NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION" series is not available on Xbox, we cannot make a comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution for NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition? Is it essentially the same as DLSS SR on PC?</strong></p>
<p>We are not using DLSS.</p>
<p><strong>What resolution and frame rate options are you offering for the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>The game runs at Full HD and 30fps. We also experimented with 4K and 60fps, but the power required to render the Japanese archipelago with these graphics is more than you can imagine and difficult to keep stable, so we had to give up. We hope to revisit this challenge in the future if the opportunity arises.</p>
<p><strong>NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening&nbsp;was previously launched on the first Switch. What kind of improvements can players expect in the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the hardware evolution of Switch 2, the graphics have been significantly improved. Elements like the sea, sky, and ground look much more real, enhancing the immersive experience of the game. Being able to have this level of graphics in a portable format is a major point to be enjoyed by players. Additionally, with mouse operation via Joy-Con 2 and USB mouse support, intuitive controls are now possible. We have also included some game content that was previously only available in Asia, so we hope players will enjoy those as well.</p>
<p><strong>Is the experience of playing with the controller as a mouse similar to using the mouse on PC? What are the differences, if any?</strong></p>
<p>The mouse controls have been closely recreated. Although there are some differences between the hardware, such as assigning the mouse wheel to the stick, the functionality has been covered.<br>
Moreover, shortcuts have been assigned to the other Joy-Con 2, so the overall functionality might even surpass that of using a mouse alone.</p>
<p><strong>Are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble in NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition?</strong></p>
<p>HD Rumble is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about the Switch 2 version of your game?</strong></p>
<p>The Nobunaga's Ambition series is a title that is a traditional Japanese game with a long history of over 40 years. This is the first time in the series that we are releasing a complete edition, and it's thanks to the positive reception of the latest title (NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening) and its steady sales. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has played it. And if you haven't tried it yet, I hope you'll take this chance to pick it up and try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
