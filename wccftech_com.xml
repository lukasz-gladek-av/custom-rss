			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod that is now available for download for free addresses one of the game's most glaring issues.</p>
<p>The mod, which was developed by well-known modder Lyall, removes the 30 FPS cap in cutscenes, which is highly distracting when playing the game at higher framerates. The mod also fixes ultrawide resolutions FOV issues and introduces a few other features and improvements, such as the option to skip intro logos, enable the developer console, and disable letterboxing and pillar boxing in cutscenes. The mod, whose installation is quite simple, requiring the user only to drop the downloaded files into the game's folder, can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/ClairObscurFix">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game featuring a fascinating Belle Époque-inspired fantasy world, a charming cast of characters voiced by some incredible talent like Ben Starr, who previously voiced Clive Rosfield from Final Fantasy XVI and, more recently, general Khazan from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, and Jennifer English, who previously voiced Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3, and a turn-based combat system featuring some real-time elements like timed-button presses for increased skill power, dodging and parrying, that make confronting enemies extremely fun. The debut game from Sandfall Interactive is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. It is also available as part of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/"> GeForce NOW service library.</a></p>

			<p>Breath of Fire IV, the fourth entry in the classic JRPG series developed by CAPCOM, is now available on PC via GOG, complete with plenty of enhancements over the original PlayStation release.</p>
<p>The newly released PC version of the game, which launches 25 years after the original released on the first PlayStation in Japan, is now available for the price of $9.99 / €9.99 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a> and comes with improvements over the PlayStation release and the original PC release that launched in 2003, such as full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, 2 localization options (English and Japanese), new rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more), improved audio engine, improved keyboard and mouse support, fixed combat and cutscene scripting issues, full support for modern controllers and more.</p>
<p>The JRPG franchise by CAPCOM has been dormant for quite some time, so hopefully the Breath of Fire IV PC release will be successful enough to show the publisher how there's still interest in its series. Lately, CAPCOM has been bringing back series that were thought to be dead, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-hands-on-preview-aging-like-fine-wine/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">Okami</a> series, so a new game or a proper remaster of some of the older entries in the series, like my personal favorites, Breath of Fire III and Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, may not entirely be off the table.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-is-out-on-july-17/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, publisher Nacon and developer Teyon announced the launch date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-styx-and-cthulhu-announcements-headline-nacon-connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a>. The standalone expansion to the first-person shooter game will be available starting July 17 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>RoboCop: Rogue City was the biggest launch registered by Nacon, making it more than understandable that they would want to build up on the successful release. Unfinished Business takes place after the events seen in the 2023 game, where the so-called New Guy in Town was defeated. The background is OCP's latest project, the OmniTower, a massive housing complex explicitly designed to meet the needs of the residents of Old Detroit. However, a group of highly trained mercenaries seizes the building, turning it into their deadly fortress. That's where RoboCop must step in to restore the rule of law.</p>
<p>The OmniTower is full of high-tech threats, such as flying drones, exploding bots, anti-personnel turrets, and deadly traps, on top of heavily armed elite troops that are equipped with mini-guns, jetpacks, and even katanas in some cases.</p>
<p>As RoboCop, players will be able to employ a vast arsenal, from the iconic Auto-9 to the brand-new Cryo Cannon. There are also devastating new finishing moves that highlight how he is the weapon himself when he picks up an enemy and smashes them into a concrete wall or a vending machine.</p>
<p>Moreover, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business will allow fans to step back into the past, when RoboCop was still police officer Alex Murphy, prior to the accident that left him near death. These unique missions will feature familiar faces and help flesh out the character even more, with the help of voice acting from the legendary Peter Weller.</p>

<p>From a gameplay standpoint, Unfinished Business will feature all the elements that made the base game successful: intense combat, thoughtful investigation, and light RPG elements. Nacon hasn't shared the pricing or the system requirements yet, but you can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right now</a>.</p>
