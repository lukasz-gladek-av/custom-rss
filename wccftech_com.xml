			<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> made a surprise appearance at the <strong>New Game+ Showcase</strong> yesterday, with <strong>Obsidian</strong> delivering two announcements, the biggest of which is undoubtedly that Avowed is launching on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> soon.</p>



<p>The action roleplaying game is about to celebrate its first anniversary. It launched for PC and Xbox Series S|X on February 18, 2026, and on <strong>February 17</strong>, the game will be available on Sony's PS5 console, following the established pattern set by Microsoft with its newfound multiplatform policy. Pre-orders are now live on the PlayStation Store, offering two options: a <strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA26136_00-0827146390058176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$49.99 Standard Edition</a></strong> and a <strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA26136_00-0074184226734561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$59.99 Premium Edition</a></strong>. If you're not quite sure about pulling the trigger on the Premium Edition, which adds a Digital Artbook and Soundtrack, 2 Player Armors, and 8 Companion Skins, there's a <strong>$10 Premium Upgrade</strong> that can be used to jump from the Standard Edition to the Premium one later. </p>



<p>By the way, there's also a pre-order bonus for all those who purchase Avowed in advance: the so-called <strong>Emperor's Feast</strong>, five royal dishes that restore health, mana, and temporarily boost attributes to give players an early edge. Here's the list of the bonus food:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 Darkest Rauataian Chocolate Cookie</li>



<li>1 Candied Nuts</li>



<li>1 Wild Mushroom Stew</li>



<li>1 Roasted Chicken</li>



<li>1 Paradisan Trout Pie</li>
</ul>



<p>The game is also tagged as being <strong>PS5 Pro Enhanced</strong> on the PlayStation Store. There are no details yet on the specifics, but it's safe to say it will look and perform best on the PS5 Pro, since it's currently the most powerful console on the market. </p>



<p>I loved playing Avowed, as you know if you've read <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my launch review</a></strong>, so I'd definitely recommend PS5 users to look forward to it. Here's a quote from my article:</p>



<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Avowed is also receiving a free Anniversary update, which will be released on all platforms. This major patch will introduce the following new features:</p>



<p><strong>New Playable Races:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Amowin</li>



<li>Oralins</li>



<li>Dwarves</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Weapon Archetypes:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Quarter-staff</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ability Tree Expansions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New abilities added to the Ranger and Fighter tres (to bring them on par with the Wizard tree)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Accessibility Features:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Arachnophobia mode</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Character Customization:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New facial feature presets and new outfits</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Photo Mode:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Community-requested feature adapted from&nbsp;Grounded</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Quality of Life:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Gear and progression improvements, bug and crash fixes</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New Game Plus Mode:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Carry over all abilities and endgame gear (with enchantments intact) into new playthrough at level 1</li>



<li>Randomized enemy modifiers (increased elemental resistance on some enemies, stun-lock immunity on others)</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the Avowed news, Obsidian also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8GuSLiE1IM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>Grounded 2</strong> (currently in early access) is about to get the <strong>Winter Update</strong>, which will add the Community Garden, a new biome attached to the existing picnic area and divided into three sub-biomes: vegetable garden, greenhouse, and pumpkin patch. New creatures like the Crickets (bus-sized with unique attack patterns) and two earwig variants (ranged/melee pairing) will introduce more tactical complexity, but there's also a new mountable creature, the Ladybug buggy, and some insects returning from the previous game, wasps and black ants. </p>



<p>The interview did not reveal a release date for the update, but the game's X account <a href="https://x.com/GroundedTheGame/status/2009400217712644142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that fans will want to watch the Casually Grounded 2 livestream next week for that.</p>

			<p>Polish indie developer <strong>Paradark Studio</strong> is still working on its intriguing '<strong>CyberWestern</strong>' first-person action/adventure game <strong>ExeKiller</strong>. </p>



<p>Paradark shared an updated gameplay overview during today's <strong>New Game+ Showcase</strong>, reviving hopes in the project. The previous gameplay trailer was released in early 2023, while the debut trailer originally went live in late 2021, coinciding with the game's announcement.</p>



<p>In ExeKiller, you take on the role of <strong>Denzel Fenix</strong>, a licensed bounty hunter working for the powerful <strong>Helion Corporation</strong>. His job is straightforward: track fugitives and extract <strong>SOULs</strong>. SOULs are digital implants used to monitor and control the population.</p>



<p>In this world, survival doesn't come cheap. Players must constantly be aware of how they manage and carry their equipment, given the limited inventory space and high prices on essential supplies. <strong>The wasteland environment itself is a threat</strong>, with radiation zones, lethal sandstorms and extreme temperatures all potentially deadly to Denzel.</p>

<p>Firearms are an important part of the gameplay experience, but so is experimentation, according to the creators. <strong>Players can combine weapons, gadgets, environmental hazards and special abilities</strong> to approach encounters creatively or avoid combat altogether. Denzel can enhance his perception through cybernetic implants, allowing players to uncover hidden elements, piece together narrative clues, and read the environment, rather than relying on waypoints.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of ExeKiller is that <strong>missions are non-linear</strong>. There is no prescribed playstyle or guided solution; instead, players are given clear objectives, but are free to approach each contract through stealth, dialogue, direct combat, or a combination of all three. <strong>Not every job has to end with a kill</strong>. Paradark promises a choice-driven narrative where players shape NPC behaviour, dialogue and the broader narrative with their decisions, leading to multiple possible outcomes and endings.</p>



<p>The game is in development for PC, and you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1701840/ExeKiller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <strong>Steam</strong></a>. However, Paradark stated that console versions are planned as well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Epictellers Entertainment Debuts First Look at cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight Gameplay Ahead of Early Access Release in Summer 2026]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Starfinder: Afterlight</strong> is a new turn-based cRPG from <strong>Epictellers Entertainment</strong>, a Barcelona-based studio that saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-qa-even-after-bg3-not-many-are-jumping-into-crpgs/">how Baldur's Gate 3 proved there was a commercial appetite for strong cRPG games</a> (as they told us in the linked exclusive interview), and wanted to offer a sci-fi flavour to those fans of the genre and anyone introduced to cRPGs through Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Today, at the New Game Plus Showcase, Epictellers debuted a first look at some gameplay, including some combat and a bit of exploration. It's not a huge look at what's to come, but it does feature some stunning voices, and we now know that a demo is due to arrive soon, ahead of its early access release set for sometime in 2026.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-pc-early-access-release-date-2026/">It was unveiled last year</a>, with a 2026 release window for its early access release and a star-studded cast already attached to it, including another Baldur's Gate 3 connection with <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-features-voice-acting-from-neil-newbon-astarion-in-baldurs-gate-3/"><strong>Neil Newbon</strong></a> both voicing a character in the game and directing the rest of the cast. </p>



<p>Speaking of the rest of the cast, on top of Neil Newbon, players will be able to enjoy the dulcet tones of <strong>Roger Clark</strong> throughout the whole game as the narrator. Clark, who you'll know as the voice of Arthur Morgan in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, was picked specifically to help bring the western feel to the game that Epictellers Entertainment wanted Starfinder: Afterlight to have.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2025 dev commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mw-pPlhAHHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside Clark and Newbon are <strong>Fred Tatasciore</strong>, <strong>Inel Tomlinson, Melissa Medína, James Alexander,</strong> and <strong>Carolina Ravassa.</strong> You'd know Tatasciore from a slew of animated films and TV shows, but also games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. You'll have heard Tomlinson in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, Medína in Borderlands 4, The Mortuary Assistant, and Warframe: 1999, to name a few. While you'd recognize Alexander from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Horizon: Call of the Mountain, and Ravassa from Overwatch and Grand Theft Auto V. </p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight boasts a talent-rich cast, thanks in part to its successful Kickstarter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turn-based-crpg-starfinder-afterlight-reaches-minimum-kickstarter-goal-80-mins/">which was funded in just 80 minutes </a>and ultimately <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description">surpassed its goal</a> by hundreds of thousands. Now that we know to expect a demo soon, hopefully, we'll also have a release date to look forward to not long after.</p>
