			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is being added this Thursday to the game The First Descendant. Nexon's free-to-play third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and ray tracing</a>, but with the official launch of Season 3 on August 7, GeForce RTX 50 Series will get even better performance thanks to Multi Frame Generation. On average, DLSS 4 runs the game 4.9x faster than native rendering.</p>



<p>Season 3 'Breakthrough' also sees the addition of Nell, a new playable character who wields arc-like telekinetic abilities, launching energy spheres that inflict debuffs and pull nearby enemies into her attacks. She is ideal for fast-paced, aggressive, run-and-gun players because she can convert all gunfire into weak point hits. Breakthrough will also expand the game world by adding a big new field area called "Axion" and a formidable Colossus boss battle. Lastly, Players can also look forward to a mountable vehicle, which will allow them to travel faster across the regions of The First Descendant.</p>



<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is also available (alongside DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex) in the single player survival horror puzzle Death Relives. Developed by small and independent Turkish developer Nyctophile Studios, Death Relives takes inspiration from Aztec mythology and real historical events from the 16th century. Players find themselves in a nightmarish world where they must survive against long-forgotten gods, such as Xipe Totec—the Aztec god of death, life, rebirth, agriculture, vegetation, and deadly warfare. </p>



<p>Throughout the game, they will visit historical locations, such as the ship Hernán Cortés traveled on to reach the land of the Aztecs. The dark and eerie atmosphere of Death Relives hides other entities lurking in the shadows that are revealed through the storyline as the protagonist, Adrian, progresses through the game. Death Relives launched around ten days ago <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1987400/Death_Relives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> and so far, most user reviews (83%) are positive.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI may break records in the gaming industry not only in terms of profits, but also in terms of price tags, as a known analyst believes the game will cost more than any other title on the market.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/">The Telegraph</a>, Wedbush Securities' Michael Patcher, known for making some bold predictions in the past, said that he expects a high price, $100, for the new entry in the series by Rockstar Games at launch, which would make it the first video game to be sold at such a high price, not counting special or limited editions. Still, no matter the price point, Patcher expects the game to be immensely profitable, likely generating $10 billion in lifetime and $500 million annually from <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/">GTA Online</a>. Commenting on the game's budget, Patcher's estimates are more in line with what we have heard from other analysts, placing them in the $1.5 billion range, also including marketing costs.</p>



<p>Although predictions may vary, the consensus among analysts is that Grand Theft Auto VI is going to be one of the biggest video game releases of all time, if not the biggest.<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-7-billion-revenue-60-days/"> Last month</a>, Konvoy's Managing Partner Josh Chapman confirmed the firm's prediction that the game will generate $7.6 billion in revenue in the first two months of availability, with Take-Two recouping a potential $2 billion investment within a month from release. Even by other metrics, such as number of copies sold, player count, and viewership, the new entry in the series is expected to be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">record-shattering release. </a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26, 2026,</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, but going from past Rockstar Games titles' launches, we should expect the game to make its debut on the platform sometime in 2027.</p>
