			<p><strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> isn't ready to release its next mainline entry into <strong>The Witcher </strong>series just yet, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/"><strong>The Witcher 4</strong> was absent from recent shows like <strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">won't arrive until "<em>at least</em>" <strong>2027</strong> according to CDPR</a>. That said, we are getting a new Witcher game much sooner than next year, with <strong>Reigns: The Witcher</strong>, a new "<em>swipe'em up</em>" game from developer <strong>Nerial</strong> and publisher <strong>Devolver Digital</strong>, arriving on PC and mobile devices on <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Reigns: The Witcher takes you back through Geralt's adventures, though not exactly in the same way they played out in the original story. Instead, all of his adventures are told through the bard, Dandelion. You'll swipe left or right at different points in the adventure to steer the story one way or another, before the tale ends with Geralt faced with an untimely demise, in one way or another.</p>



<p>At the end of every run, Dandelion adds to his log of tales to be told on stage, increasing your ability to string together a truly gripping story, even if it's one that doesn't exactly stay true to how you remember it happening originally.</p>

<p>This is the sixth entry in Nerial's Reigns series, which will officially be a full decade old this coming August 2026. After the initial <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/Reigns/?curator_clanid=39063225">Reigns </a></strong>title and its <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/717640/Reigns_Her_Majesty/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Her Majesty</a></strong> follow-up, Nerial immediately started applying the formula to other franchises, to great success, with Reigns games based on <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/897820/Reigns_Game_of_Thrones/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Game of Thrones</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437040/Reigns_Three_Kingdoms/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Three Kingdoms</a></strong>. The studio also has a sci-fi variant called <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663400/Reigns_Beyond/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Reigns: Beyond</a></strong>, which was the most recent release before the upcoming The Witcher variant.</p>



<p>Nerial is also the same studio behind one of 2022's more intriguing indie games, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371720/Card_Shark/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Card Shark</a></strong>, which turned plenty of heads with its striking visual style and deceitful gameplay.</p>



<p>Even though we'll have to wait until 2027 for The Witcher 4, hopefully, this spin-off Reigns title isn't the last we hear about The Witcher in 2026, and we'll have an official word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/">on the rumoured <strong>The Witcher 3 DLC</strong> </a>that is said to arrive sometime this year.</p>
