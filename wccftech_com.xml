			<p>In a brief Instagram reel <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/?igsh=ZnZzeTczcXQ5bHI5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted by Wired Japan</a> (and <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1978569051963310419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Culture Crave</a>) following a visit to Kojima Productions in Tokyo, Hideo Kojima shared his thoughts on how to use AI during game creation. The renowned game designer behind the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series believes artificial intelligence to be a 'friend' which will help him remain 'one step ahead' in the future.</p>



<p><em>A lot of people use AI in creative work to come up with ideas, but I think of AI as more of a friend. Since I've been in the digital industry, I would lead the creative part and use AI to boost efficiency. I would like AI to handle the tedious tasks. That would lower cost and cut down on time. It's more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it. I see a future where I stay one step ahead; creating together with AI.</em></p>



<p>Hideo Kojima's stance appears to forego an ideological position, whether in favor or against AI, and adopt a pragmatic mindset. Indeed, lowering costs and cutting down on time are two of the most significant problems that the games industry is facing since both development costs and timeframes are constantly on the rise. Mindful usage of AI technologies without negatively impacting human jobs may be the only way to solve or at least mitigate the issue.</p>



<p>Kojima has, after all, always been at the forefront of exploring new boundaries with technology, and continues to do so. Last month, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-partnering-to-push-the-boundaries-of-storytelling-with-a-new-ar-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an unexpected partnership with Niantic Spatial to create a Death Stranding-inspired Augmented Reality experience. Following the June launch of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for PlayStation 5, Hideo Kojima and his team are now <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainly focused</a> on OD, a horror game in development for Xbox Game Studios, while Physint, the new action espionage game in development with PlayStation Studios, is further away on the horizon. Then there are also the big screen adaptations of the Death Stranding IP: a live action film and an animated film.</p>
