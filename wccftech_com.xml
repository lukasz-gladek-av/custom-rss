			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-predictions-for-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-half-life-to-return-major-ubisoft-changes/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was first revealed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c">six years ago</a> now, in 2019, two years after the original Hollow Knight came out and set a new standard for 2D Metroidvanias. Since then, players have been keenly waiting for any news about the coming sequel, and when we'd finally get the chance to play it.</p>
<p>If you're incredibly keen, you might get your first chance to play it this coming September 18, 2025, because a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum">IGN</a> has confirmed that it will be playable by then. As part of an exhibit inside a museum in Australia, that is.</p>
<p>Australia's National Museum of Screen Culture, ACMI, is hosting a game-focused exhibit in September called Game Worlds, which will include a playable build of Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>The hope now, is that this news means that it'll be playable outside of an Australian museum by then. Surely it wouldn't be available in this museum's exhibit, and not already be out everywhere in the world, right?</p>
<p>It would be a strange situation if that ended up being the case, but it feels very unlikely. We know that developer Team Cherry is targeting a 2025 launch, so then the museum exhibit's September 18 date means we should be looking at a release date for Silksong arriving at least a little before that.</p>
<p>It could arrive in August, or perhaps the exhibit will be part of Silksong's launch. Team Cherry is based in Southern Australia, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if the studio wanted to put its home on the map a little more with the launch of one of the world's most anticipated indie games.</p>
<p>If a summer release date is what we have to look forward to, then that means we could be looking at a Summer Game Fest release date reveal. Not that Silksong needs a larger event around it to bring eyes to any news about the game, but it would fit the kind of big reveals Geoff Keighley strives to include in his annual showcases.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/evil-dead-the-game/">Evil Dead: The Game</a> is being delisted from digital storefronts, publisher Saber Interactive confirmed on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021">Steam page</a> before delisting it on Steam. Players noted on <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/evil-dead-the-game-is-no-longer-on-the-epic-games-store-and-ps-store-sparking-fears-it-could-be-shut-down/">Reddit</a> earlier in the week that it had been removed from the Epic Games Store and the PlayStation Store, raising suspicion that it had been delisted.</p>
<p>Saber confirmed those fears today, removing it from Steam and the Xbox Store, where it was still available for a short time after being removed from the Epic and PlayStation storefronts.</p>
<p>"<em>We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts</em>," Saber wrote in its statement.</p>
<p>"<em>Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.</em>"</p>
<p>The game's developer, Boss Team Games, stopped making new content for Evil Dead: The Game in <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/09/evil-dead-the-game-ends-new-content-development-switch-version-cancelled">2023</a> and canceled a previously planned Nintendo Switch version at the time. Unfortunately, that it is being entirely delisted now is just the next step in what's become the standard for online-only games with no offline mode.</p>
<p>Perhaps by the time servers go offline, Saber and Boss Team Games will have finished work on an offline mode so that those who do own the game can continue to play it in some fashion. Saber didn't provide a timeline for when servers will be taken down, but it would be surprising to see them last longer than the rest of the year, now that the game is officially off storefronts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astral-chain-director-and-nier-automata-designer-takahisa-taura-has-left-platinumgames-to-form-his-own-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The exodus of PlatinumGames' hugely talented developers continues, with Astral Chain director and designer on Nier Automata, <strong>Takahisa Taura</strong>, confirming that he has also left the studio, though not to follow Hideki Kamiya to Clovers. Instead, Taura founded Eel Game Studio with a few other founding members.</p>
<p>In an interview with Famitsu (transcribed by <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1917511865078538755?s=46">Genki</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/top-platinumgames-designer-quits-studio-starts-new-game-company/">VGC</a>), Taura confirmed his departure from Platinum and the founding of his new studio, but wouldn't say who the other founding members are. He also confirmed that despite beginning this new adventure, he'll still collaborate with Yoko Taro, Yosuke Saito, and Keiichi Okabe on an unannounced project.</p>
<p>All four were key members of Nier Automata, so this unannounced project could potentially be Nier-related, but it's still too early to tell.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya, former creative lead at PlatinumGames and one of the studio's founders, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/">left Platinum in 2023</a>, kicking up a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/">YouTube channel at first</a> while working to form another new studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Clovers</a>. Which, as fans of Kamiya's work immediately recognized, was a callback to a studio Kamiya previously founded, Clover.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/hideki-kamiya-on-returning-to-his-roots-with-clovers-and-okami-2/">VGC</a> last year, Kamiya confirmed that the developers who started Clovers with him were mainly former PlatinumGames members, and that he left Platinum mostly because he was unsatisfied there.</p>
<p>"<em>If I was satisfied at Platinum, then I wouldn't have left. If there was one thing I am worried about, it's the fact I was VP and chief game designer of PlatinumGames. And so with me quitting, I worry about the people there, the staff there. Of course, if they're motivated and happy at Platinum, I believe that's the right path for them. But if there are others whose mindset aligns more with what we're building here at Clovers, we want to welcome and provide a path for them, too. I see that as a responsibility I have to those people after leaving Platinum.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, Kamiya is speaking for himself, but his words raise questions about how things are internally at Platinum. Taura, like Kamiya, is another massive talent the studio is missing now.</p>
<p>This is not to say that PlatinumGames is without talented developers. It's just to point out that Platinum was a happy home for some of the best and most storied developers in the video game industry for years until it wasn't. It'll be interesting to see how the studio continues to evolve.</p>
<p>And regarding Taura and Eel Game Studio, hopefully it's not too long before we see what they're working on.</p>
