			<p>The Xbox next-generation system is reportedly targeting a 2027 launch window, according to a new rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from a new video shared by Moore's Law is Dead on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">YouTube</a>, whose track record regarding console rumors has been solid with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">on-point leaks for the PlayStation 5 Pro and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>. According to the YouTuber, multiple unspecified sources have revealed that Microsoft is talking openly about the 2027 release window with partners behind the scenes, with reports having become even more frequent since earlier leaks of the APU..</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-next-amd-magnus-apu-leaked-specifications">Xbox Next AMD Magnus APU Leaked Specifications</h2>



<p>Besides discussing the potential Xbox next-generation system release window, the new video by Moore's Law is Dead also discussed some of the specifications of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/">AMD Magnus APU</a> that will power the system, which you can find summarized below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Xbox Next (Magnus APU) Rumored Specs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>APU ARCHITECTURE (Chiplet Design)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Total Die Size</td><td>408 mm² (Full Size)</td></tr><tr><td>Chiplet 1 (SOC)</td><td>144 mm² (CPU Core, Video Out, AI Engine)<br>Node: TSMC N3P (Node confirmed in alleged external documentation).</td></tr><tr><td>Chiplet 2 (GPU)</td><td>264 mm² (Shared with desktop Radeon products)<br>Node: TSMC N3C or N3P (Unconfirmed).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>GPU</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Compute Units (CUs)</td><td>68 RDNA5 CUs (Disabled from up to 70 CUs)</td></tr><tr><td>Shader Engines</td><td>4 Shader Engines (3 standard engines + 1 lopsided shared engine with either 8 or 16 CUs). Each engine has 2 Shader Arrays.</td></tr><tr><td>L2 Cache</td><td>At least 24 MB L2 Cache (5x the Xbox Series X)<br>*Note: Speculative, based on desktop Radeon products.*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>CPU</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Core Architecture</td><td>Zen 6</td></tr><tr><td>Core Count</td><td>Up to 3 Zen 6 cores (Faster than the PS6 Orion cores) + 8 Zen 6c cores<br>Shared 12MB L3 cache<br>*Note: Final usable core count is unknown.*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>MEMORY AND POWER</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bus</td><td>192-bit Memory Bus</td></tr><tr><td>Total RAM</td><td>Up to 48 GB of GDDR7 (Possible configurations: 24 GB, 36 GB, or 48 GB)</td></tr><tr><td>TDP (Estimation)</td><td>250W to 350W (60-70% more than the PS6).<br>*Speculation: reportedly still aiming for a traditional console form factor.*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>NPU</strong></td></tr><tr><td>NPU Architecture</td><td>110 TOPS (at 6W) or 46 TOPS (at 1.2W)<br>*Note: Two power modes are likely for energy budgeting to meet Microsoft Copilot requirements.*</td></tr><tr><td>AI Performance (TOPS)</td><td>110 TOPS (at 6W) or 46 TOPS (at 1.2W)<br>*Note: Two power modes likely for energy budgeting to meet Microsoft Copilot requirements.*</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Unlike for the PlayStation 6 Orion APU, Moore's Law is Dead doesn't know the final clock targets for the CPU and GPU of the Xbox next-generation system, so it's impossible to make a solid performance comparison between the two systems. </p>



<p>Even in the most extreme scenario of a 350W TDP, GPU clocking above 3GHz, and some CPU cores above 6GHz, the Xbox Next is expected to be no more than a third faster than the PlayStation 6. Considering Microsoft did lower the expected clock speeds of the Xbox Series X, the same could happen for the Xbox next-generation system, especially if the company is going for the expected power target of a console.</p>



<p>As such, on average, the Xbox next-generation system should be expected to offer the premium version of the performance the PlayStation 6 will offer, according to Moore's Law is Dead. If a game delivers 4K@120 FPS with ray tracing on the PS6, it will likely deliver 4K@144 FPS on the Xbox next-generation system. This is a small difference that will probably go unnoticed by anyone who isn't a PC-focused gamer playing on a high-refresh monitor looking for the very best.</p>

<p>As Moore's Law is Dead, the track record is not perfect, we have to take everything with a grain of salt until Microsoft announces the Xbox next generation system <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ceo-were-designing-a-full-roadmap-of-gaming-chips-for-xbox/">in much better detail than they have in the past</a>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">With both systems reportedly targeting a 2027 release window</a>, the next console generation is fast approaching.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-is-launching-in-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-according-to-amd-leaker.1321657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned AMD leaker Kepler has <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/post-270885018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed on the NeoGAF board</a> that Sony is planning to launch the PlayStation 6 console in 2027, with the caveat that 'unexpected delays' could still happen.</p>



<p>This would be right on time for a 7-year lifecycle, just like its predecessor, the PlayStation 4. The main difference would be with regards to the PlayStation 5 Pro, which was released four years after the PS5 (and therefore only three years before the alleged PS6 launch window), whereas the PlayStation 4 Pro appeared on the market three years after the PS4 and four years before the launch of the PS5.</p>



<p>Rumors about the specifications of the PlayStation 6 have been circulating for a while, mainly due to YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an estimated computing power of 34 to 40 Teraflops with a massive ray tracing performance uplift of 6x to 12x compared to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, AMD and Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have divulged new details on their ongoing Project Amethyst collaboration</a> to improve hardware and software in future GPUs and consoles. Three technologies were singled out at this time: Radiance Cores, Neural Arrays, and Universal Compression. </p>



<ul>
<li>The first one is specifically designed to deliver that rumored ray tracing performance boost: the Radiance Cores hardware blocks will accelerate the computationally intensive ray tracing traversal calculations, freeing shader cores to work on the rest of the rendered scene. </li>



<li>Neural Arrays, on the other hand, are dedicated AI accelerator units integrated into the GPU architecture. They are designed to handle machine learning inference tasks natively on the console hardware, achieving much greater efficiency compared to current methods.</li>



<li>Finally, Universal Compression is a new device-agnostic compression technology that reduces the data footprint across textures, geometry, and other game assets without significantly reducing quality. It optimizes memory bandwidth and storage, allowing games to load faster and operate more efficiently. This should also translate into improved streaming performance, possibly reducing stuttering during gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>Interestingly, in that video, PlayStation System Architect Mark Cerny also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased that these technologies would appear on a new console (the PlayStation 6) in a few years' time</a>. If the rumor is true, that just means two years, possibly a bit sooner than most expected. Indeed, it feels like we only started getting 'next-generation' games in the past couple of years, whereas most titles previously supported cross-generation releases. Still, this generation has a few aces left, like The Witcher IV and The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>

			<p>The Little Nightmares franchise has been a bit of a surprise hit, moving over 20 million units to date, so it’s <em>not </em>surprising that publisher Bandai Namco has opted to continue on with a third entry even though series creators Tarsier Studios has decided to move on. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares III</a> instead comes to us from the horror specialists at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Supermassive Games</a>, who have made a clear effort to recreate the look and feel of previous entries in the series. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Is Little Nightmares III a successful continuation of the franchise? Or is it time to wake from this recurring dream? Rub that sleep from your eyes and read on to find out...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the Little Nightmares series has always taken a wordless enigmatic approach to storytelling, the first two games offered more character development and hinted-at lore than you might expect. Supermassive at least partially resets the universe in Little Nightmares III, introducing two new mysterious protagonists, "Low" and "Alone," and some changes to the series' narrative structure that turns the "Little Nightmares" title into more of a literal statement. Overall, our new protagonists are likable enough, but some of the sense of intrigue and mystery that surrounded the first two Little Nightmares games is missing here.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In terms of gameplay, Supermassive doesn’t stray far from Tarsier’s blueprint. Little Nightmares III is a 2.5D platformer, with players having a relatively limited moveset, including the ability to jump, grab onto ledges and items, run, and crouch to sneak and fit through tight spaces. New to this game, each playable character now has a specific tool they carry with them at all times — Low has a bow that they can use to shoot things from afar, and Alone wields a wrench they can use to smash stuff and turn some cranks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For the most part, Supermassive have very accurately replicated the feel of past Little Nightmares games, for better and worse. Character movement is very deliberate, which isn't a bad thing in a horror game, but platforming in particular can feel very inconsistent and "canned." There are times when the game's fixed camera angles and perspectives make it very difficult to properly judge jumps, with certain trouble spots causing me to die dozens of times (and I’ve been playing difficult platformers since the '80s). Thankfully, Supermassive<em> has </em>addressed Little Nightmares II's excruciatingly bad combat. It's still not <em>great </em>here, but both Low and Alone having their own dedicated weapons greatly reduces frustration.</p>



<p>Speaking of our dual protagonists, the other big thing Supermassive has added to Little Nightmares III is online co-op. Little Nightmares II took a The-Last-of-Us-like approach, with players relying on an AI-controlled partner to get past some obstacles, and you can still play that way in Little Nightmares III, but you can also now team up with an actual human. Due to the new co-op focus, Supermassive have included some puzzles and challenges that require some slightly more involved teamwork. Nothing too crazy — this isn't a Hazelight game — but you will need some coordination when playing with another person, which can be fun.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, these moments aren’t as satisfying when playing solo. Players pick Low or Alone at the beginning of a singleplayer run, and there’s no ability to switch back and forth between them. During some of the more complex team tasks, you simply do your side of the challenge and the AI will automatically do their side. Strictly speaking, this works, but it almost feels like cheating as your AI partner flawlessly completes their half of a puzzle. When your AI companion isn’t being overly competent, they’re often the opposite, getting lost behind or failing to zero in and do a simple thing you need to proceed. The AI always came around in the end for me, but not before some moments of irritation and wasted time.</p>



<p>Supermassive could also have done more to make co-op accessible to more people. Little Nightmares III can only be played online with folks on your friends list; there is no couch co-op, and your ability to communicate with your partner is very limited. That said, Little Nightmares III does include a Hazelight-style Friend Pass, allowing you to play with an online pal even if they don't own a copy of the game, so kudos for that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Beyond the addition of co-op, Little Nightmares III feels very much like its predecessors, with its various sequences and set pieces sometimes feeling almost copy-pasted. Platform over rickety structures, crawl through various vents and tunnels, find skittery hiding nomes, tote around batteries to power devices, observe and sneak by various shambling monstrosities, run from those monstrosities in tense chase scenes, etc. If you’ve played past Little Nightmares games, you’ve done all this before. Little Nightmares III only summons up a couple of genuinely original sequences, which are saved for the game's final chapter. This finale hints at what Little Nightmares III <em>could </em>have been, but for most of the game's runtime, the game is merely fine. Arguably more fun and refined than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often-frustrating Little Nightmares II</a>, but rarely surprising.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is also rarely all that scary. Earlier Little Nightmares titles were far from perfect, but they had a special <em>something</em>. The leathery Muppet-ey freaks that populated Tarsier's Little Nightmares games were uniquely off-putting, and while Supermassive tries their best to dream up their own atrocities, their creations don't quite measure up with many treading too close to generic creepy doll territory. Visually, Little Nightmares III also lacks some of the ambiance of the first two games, and even on PS5, it doesn't run quite as well as I'd like.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, despite the relatively negative tone of this review, Little Nightmares III does have its moments and can be fun with another human player. The game just doesn’t stand out in any particular way and with a relatively brief 4-hour runtime, this will likely be one of those dreams that fades from your mind not long after you wake up.</p>

					<h2>Little Nightmares III</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Little Nightmares III does a solid job of emulating the gameplay of earlier entries in the series, sometimes to a fault, but it doesn’t bring a whole lot else to the table and new developer Supermassive Games can’t quite pin down the eerie tone and creeping tension that made these games popular. While the ability to play online with others will appeal to some, it’s hard to escape the feeling that this series has officially gone from sleeper hit to just plain sleepy.</p>
