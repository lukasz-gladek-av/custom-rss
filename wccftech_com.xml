			<p>Arrowhead Games has announced that the previously PlayStation-console exclusive, Helldivers 2, is finally making its way across the aisle to team green, and will launch on Xbox Series X/S later this summer on <strong>August 26, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by Arrowhead's chief creative officer, Johan Pilestedt, during a short livestream where Arrowhead revealed the trailer for Helldivers 2 coming to Xbox, followed by Pilestedt briefly speaking about how players have been requesting backup since Helldivers 2 launched, and the best way for Arrowhead to accommodate those requests in the fight for democracy, was to add a new platform to the mix. </p>



<p>Pre-orders for Helldivers 2 on Xbox are already live for those who want to make sure they can join the fight right when the game goes live on August 26. Helldivers 2 will also not be launching on Xbox Series consoles directly into Xbox Game Pass. </p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/">Xbox Wire blog post</a>, game director on Helldivers 2, Mikael Eriksson added "<em>We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years - and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.</em>"</p>



<p>Despite the fact that players have been asking for Helldivers 2 to come to Xbox since the game first released on PlayStation and PC, it wouldn't have been the biggest shock if it never happened, considering the fact that PlayStation did publish the game. Arrowhead isn't a PlayStation first-party studio, but as the game's publisher, it still held strong sway over where the game ended up. Fortunately for Xbox players, a deal was reached, and now those with naught but a Series X/S at home can join the fight for Super Earth. </p>



<p>And just in time too, since Xbox players need something to take their minds off the week that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">Xbox and Microsoft have had</a>. Yesterday, news of mass layoffs at Microsoft started to trickle out, with more than 9,000 people laid off across all of Microsoft, a not insignificant amount of those coming from the Gaming division. Multiple projects were cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">The Initiative's Perfect Dark</a>, the latter of which saw the studio shut down. <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG was canned</a>, along with several other unannounced projects. <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">Romero Studios had the funding for their game cut</a>, and there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/">still more details coming</a> regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">just how many people are losing their jobs</a>. And the week isn't even over yet.</p>
