			<p>Wreckreation is the latest game from Three Fields Entertainment, a studio that was founded by <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the beloved Burnout series. Published by THQ Nordic, after Wreckreation was first announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">2022</a>, three years later we have a release date to look forward to, with the open-world driving sandbox arriving on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>The news was announced alongside a new trailer that showcases the bright vistas and the insane tracks that are possible for players to create in this sandbox title, as Wreckreation is as much about building your own dream tracks as it is racing them.</p>

<p>What makes building your own tracks as core to Wreckreation as the actual driving is the fact that you're not swapping from one mode to another if you want to make a change or adjustment to the road in front of you.</p>



<p>Changes to the track, your environment, like the weather or time of day, adding loops, and even adding a slew of decorations can all be done on the fly at the press of a button. With more than 50 cars, and 400 square kilometers of sandbox to run around in, there are plenty of ways you can create your own racing paradise.</p>



<p>Wreckreation will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 28, 2025, for $39.99/â‚¬39.99.</p>
