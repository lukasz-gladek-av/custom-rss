			<p>NetEase has revealed the new convergence mode K'un-Lun: Heart of Heaven map that will be arriving in Marvel Rivals later this week, on September 25, 2025. The Summer Special Vol.2 is also now live in the game, and players can start to earn free cosmetics from the limited event until it closes on October 17, 2025. </p>



<p>This is the latest update since Marvel Rivals' <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/">Season 4 debuted earlier this month on September 12</a>, which also brought a new hero, Angela, to the game. Though perhaps more important was the fact that Season 4 marked the addition of a new playable platform for Marvel Rivals, with the game making its way to PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>The map reveal trailer shows off the vistas and intricately decorated hallways that will provide the backdrop for players' clashes, though as with any shooter, you won't get to really be familiar with the map until you've had the chance to play it yourself. At least the trailer allows you to take in the work NetEase put into the visual design of the map, since you'll likely be too focused on the match to notice when in-game.</p>

<p>New character cosmetics for Hela will also arrive alongside the map on Thursday, which you can see in the clip NetEase shared to X (formerly Twitter) below.</p>

<p>Shortly after Marvel Rivals came to PS4, NetEase introduced the game's technical director, Fanfan, to players in a new video series called 'Technically Speaking.' In its inaugural video, Fanfan addressed concerns that have surfaced from players around the game's performance and offered some explanation as to what the studio is doing to try to fix the issues.</p>



<p>He also pointed to a standard test that PC players can run on their devices, to help determine where their graphical settings should be to ensure they get the smoothest, most stable experience possible during gameplay. Switching around your settings won't solve every issues players have, but it's the best place to start trying.</p>

			<p>Today, Ubisoft announced that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is getting an expansion titled From the Ashes, arriving on all platforms on December 19, 2025. The expansion brings players back to Pandora to a section of its western front and places them in a new story that is arriving the same day as the release of the next film in James Cameron's cinematic series, Avatar: Fire and Ash.</p>



<p>You can tell by the trailer that the tone of this expansion is darker than the story of the base game, and according to Ubisoft it'll even take advantage of features soon to be implemented in the game, namely the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/">third-person mode due to arrive on December 5, 2025</a>, two weeks ahead of the expansion's release.</p>



<p>From the Ashes follows So'lek on a revenge mission after the Ash clan teamed up with the RDA, ambushing him and his fellow Sarentu Na'vi. When he wakes up after the attack, his rage takes him on a destructive path to try to save his family and deliver justice to his enemies.</p>



<p>"<em>With From the Ashes, we wanted to push the boundaries of what players can experience on Pandora</em>," said Omar Bouali, Massive Entertainment's creative director, in a press release. "<em>This expansion delivers a darker, more personal story, enhanced immersion via both the first and third-person gameplay</em>, <em>and intense new combat mechanics that deepen the emotional and tactical stakes. We wanted to offer fans a thrilling new perspective on the Western Frontier, with deeper storytelling and more visceral gameplay</em>."</p>

<p>Executive vice president of franchise development at Lightstorm Entertainment (the production company founded by James Cameron), Josua Izzo, added, "<em>Our partnership with Massive Entertainment has allowed us to expand this universe in bold new ways with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. This new expansion, From the Ashes, will release at the same day as the theatrical release for Avatar: Fire and Ash - a film that explores darker corners of Pandora and introduces the formidable Ash People - we're equally excited for Avatar fans to experience untold stories through new interactive adventures</em>."</p>



<p>So basically, you can head to your local cinema to watch Avatar: Fire and Ash when it premieres, and then jump into the From the Ashes expansion for Frontiers of Pandora on your PC or console when you get home.</p>



<p>"<em>We can't wait for fans to experience this new chapter in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora,</em>" continued Luigi Priore, vice president and general manager of Disney and Pixar Games. "<em>From the Ashes continues the journey of Na'vi resistance warrior So'lek and demonstrates how Disney and Pixar Games works with our collaborators to craft wholly original stories grounded in the worlds they love</em>."</p>



<p>The expansion will be available for $24.99 USD, though if you don't already own Frontiers of Pandora, you'll be able to grab the expansion and the base game in a bundled 'From the Ashes' edition for $39.99.</p>
