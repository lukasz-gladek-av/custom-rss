			<p>Xbox president and chief executive officer, Sarah Bond, has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-is-100-percent-looking-at-making-things-in-the-future-says-president/">put down any notions from players wondering if Xbox is still making consoles and hardware</a>. A next-gen Xbox is on the way; there's seemingly no question about it. Questions about <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">what will be packed into that new box and what it'll look like</a>, however, won't be answered anytime soon. Though, according to Bond in a new interview, we can expect it to be three things: a "<em>very premium, very high-end, curated experience</em>." It's also worth noting that those three probably also mean a fourth thing: very expensive.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8&amp;t=377s">interview with Mashable</a>, discussing the ROG Xbox Ally X handheld that ASUS created in collaboration with Xbox and Microsoft, Mashable asks Bond if they could say anything about next-gen Xbox hardware, and if they can comment on rumours floating around that Microsoft is looking to make the next-genertion of Xbox hardware some kind of inbetween a console and a PC.</p>



<p>Essentially, taking the experience you get on an ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X handheld, where you can play your Steam, GOG, BattleNet, EA Play, etc., games, and your Xbox games on one device. That's the rumour, anyway, that Mashable refers to.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The beginning of Bond's response is a comment on what Mashable had already said about the next-gen hardware, saying, "<em>Well, I can tell you you're right, that the next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end, curated experience.</em>"</p>



<p>Then, while gesturing to the ROG Xbox Ally X sitting between her and Mashable's tech editor, Bond continues, "<em>You're starting to see some of the thinking that we have in this handheld, but I don't want to give it all away</em>."</p>



<p>On the one hand, this is simply an executive hyping up her company's next major product. Of course she'll say it'll a "<em>premium, very high-end</em>" experience. On the other hand, her short comment regarding how we're already starting to see where Microsoft and Xbox are thinking of moving its hardware forward in the ROG Xbox Ally X, is arguably the most interesting part of this. </p>



<p>An Xbox console where you can access and play all the games in your PC gaming library across multiple PC launchers and digital storefronts, that delivers a console experience for your PC games, does sound like exactly the kind of thing that could make Xbox consoles interesting again.</p>



<p>If the rumours are to be believed, we'll see if that'll be reality sometime around 2027. In other Xbox hardware news, after Microsoft raised the prices of the consoles players buy in stores, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">it also raised the price of Xbox development kits for game developers</a>. If you're looking for more on the ROG Xbox Ally X, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">you can check out my review of the device</a>, as well as my <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">interview with two ASUS executives who confirm that the ROG Xbox Ally line of handhelds is the way forward for ASUS and its ROG handheld devices</a>. </p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers">The Verge</a> reveals that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">following the price hike</a> of Xbox Series X/S consoles in the US (the second one in the US in 2025), <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">raising the price of Xbox Game Pass</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">release of a very expensive Xbox-branded, ASUS-made handheld</a>, it's not just the average Xbox fan and consumer who's paying more for Xbox and Xbox-branded hardware. Game developers also have to pay more now for Xbox development kits.</p>



<p>Sources speaking to The Verge claim that the price for an Xbox development kit has jumped 33%, from its old $1,500 price tag to its new <strong>$2,000 USD</strong> price tag. Just like when Microsoft announced the price hike for Series X/S consoles, the increase "<em>reflects macroeconomic developments</em>." However, unlike the recent price increase in the US for the Series X/S, this price hike goes for anyone across the globe looking to grab a development kit.</p>



<p>It's worth noting here that development kit versions of consoles are inherently far more expensive than their consumer-facing counterparts. They come loaded with additional hardware and power that's designed to make them capable of testing various unfinished and unoptimized versions of games, and that's before even getting to the different suite of software options available to developers when they plug their games into these development kits to test them for a commercial release.</p>



<p>That's all to say that the initial $1,500 price tag is definitely expensive, but it's not out of the question that a development kit costs at least four figures to acquire. It's also worth noting that the price of development kits is often a difficult thing to pin down, since that's usually the sort of detail only shared under NDAs between game developers and manufacturers like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.</p>



<p>What's notable about this price increase is that it comes at a time when Microsoft has decidedly shirked off any notion that it is the home of 'the best deal in gaming' anymore and is now 'the most expensive deal in gaming' between the cost of an Xbox console and its premium subscription service, along with the fact that, just like the price increase of the Series X/S consoles, the price of development kits seems to be going up, at least in part, due to tariffs implemented by the current United States administration.</p>



<p>Despite several major successes, the video game industry, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/50-of-games-industry-layoffs-have-taken-place-in-california">particularly in the United States</a>, has remained in dire straits for the last few years. Raising the barrier to entry for developers who are potentially looking to put their games on Xbox makes it feel like Microsoft is trying to catch flies with vinegar rather than honey. Why would a studio that's already concerned about making the money they spend on making their game back go with a platform that has made it more expensive to be a part of from the jump?</p>



<p>Even considering that you can technically turn any Series X/S console you buy into a development kit by digging into the settings and paying a fee to Microsoft to get it up and running properly, due to the significant hardware limitations between what you get in a Series X versus the development kit, that's likely not an option for many developers. Of course, it all depends on the kind of game you're making, but the point stands that just using consumer-grade Series consoles is not a solid solution to getting around this price hike.</p>



<p>At least it lines up with what seems to be Microsoft's new approach to make Xbox the most expensive deal in gaming, whether you're playing the games, or making them.</p>

			<p>Today, developer Free Range Games and publisher North Beach Games announced the launch date of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-durins-folk-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durin's Folk DLC</a> for the survival game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.</p>



<p>This first expansion will be released on November 18 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. According to the developers, it will expand the game with more than 20 hours of added content (plus repeatable cooperative events set in randomized dungeons).</p>



<p>Durin's Folk will introduce new endgame content, including an additional story chapter rich with expanded lore, mysterious and challenging areas beyond the mountain’s caverns, thoughtful new gameplay mechanics, and more. </p>



<p>Players will now be able to rescue and recruit NPCs (non-player characters) meet in the mines of Moria, and these recruits will join your settlement and assume useful roles like blacksmith, miner, brewmaster, and guard. Over time, players may even build great works called Monuments with help from the aforementioned NPCs. Through the story, they will uncover the mystery of Durin's Tower, explore the area outside the mountain for the first time, and build massive bases in the large new play area. New materials, items, and recipes will provide more stuff to craft for the dwarven player characters. Lastly, Durin's Folk randomized endgame expeditions that players can repeatedly dive into to get juicy loot.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-is-out-october-24-for-pc-ps5-features-john-rhys-davies-as-gimli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally launched in October 2023</a> on PC via the Epic Games Store and PlayStation 5. In late August 2024, it also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-now-available-on-steam-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became available on Steam and Xbox Series S and X</a>.</p>



<p>While the game did not set any sales charts on fire, it did well enough to warrant two years of support and now this Durin's Folk DLC. On Steam, it has a 'Very Positive' rating of user reviews, and estimates indicate it may have sold around half a million units on the platform.</p>
