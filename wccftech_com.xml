			<p>Not every Assassin's Creed game, but most of them, revolve around a single protagonist. That said, the most recent release in the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-culture-war-threw-ubisoft-off-making-the-publisher-focus-on-showing-how-it-was-a-game-not-a-message/">centred around dual protagonists Naoe and Yasuke,</a> with players jumping back and forth between the two as they pleased, depending on which playstyle they preferred. It wasn't an entirely new premise for the series, but according to associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/">GamesRadar,</a> it's one the studio will consider utilizing again - so long as they have a good reason to.</p>



<p>The last time Ubisoft went with dual protagonists for an Assassin's Creed game was with 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate, featuring twin siblings Jacob and Evie Frye. They had some differences, but nothing quite as stark as Naoe and Yasuke. Lemay-Comtois even says himself, "<em>The differences between Evie and Jacob were mostly cosmetic. It's more like a 'which one do you prefer?' kind of deal. They play very, very similarly, except with very few select skills.</em>"</p>



<p>There were much more tangible differences between Naoe and Yasuke, each character having weapons that the other couldn't use, and of course, each of them having entirely different playstyles between Naoe's classic stealth gameplay and Yasuke's front-door-barging gameplay. However, those differences, Lemay-Comtois points out, can divide players in their experience with the game.</p>



<p>"<em>Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It's not just a 'well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.' Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke, it's more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too.</em>" </p>



<p>Ubisoft's experience here with Naoe and Yasuke, however, won't stop the studio from going down that well again. "<em>I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future - if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting</em>."</p>



<p>Though Lemay-Comtois makes the point that it would have to make sense narratively for Ubisoft to return to dual protagonists, it's also worth wondering if dual protagonists would fit the future structure of Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed games more than they may have in the past. We know from the Animus Hub and the post-launch content for Shadows that Ubisoft is working towards making its top series resemble a live service game you can keep coming back to more than a singular experience. Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-plans-to-focus-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/">chief executive officer Yves Guillemot discussed earlier this year that live service and open world games would be the company's focus going forward</a>.</p>



<p>It's possible that having two characters at the forefront could open up more live service opportunities with how new in-game content is designed. That sounds like a more legitimate reason for Ubisoft to continue with dual protagonists since, realistically, they could make almost anything work within the game's narrative and setting, if Ubisoft really wanted to.</p>

			<p>Where Winds Meet is the hottest new free-to-play game on the market as 2025 winds down, and developer Everstone Studio and publisher NetEase are ready for its popularity with a jam-packed month of updates for the game's December 2025 roadmap.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/">hitting over 9 million players on PC and PS5</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997337719257895205">more than 5 million pre-registrations for the mobile version</a>, which is still to arrive on December 12, 2025, Everstone Studio is already adding huge chunks to the game, the big highlight being the addition of an entire new region for players to explore called Roaring Sands.</p>



<p>There are also new bosses to defeat, including a new campaign boss, and new limited-time activities for players to take advantage of.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Discover the Winds of December:</p><p>🗺️New Region: Roaring Sands<br>🌊New Bosses: River Master and Feng Ruzhi<br>📱Global Mobile Launch: Dec 12 (UTC)<br>🗡️New Hero's Realm, Sword Trial and more! <a href="https://t.co/d12Ra9uXwb">pic.twitter.com/d12Ra9uXwb</a></p></div>— Where Winds Meet (@WhereWindsMeet_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997001761807388991?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The first week of additions, which includes the two new Jianghu Legacy quests, is already available at the time of this writing. The second week additions, which include the new River Master campaign boss and the big highlight of the Roaring Sands region, will arrive at the end of this week, alongside the game's launch on iOS and Android mobile devices.</p>



<p>The second new boss fight of the month, Feng Ruzhi, will arrive in the third week, alongside two limited-time activities. The final week offers the Scarlet Shock Sword Trial and Hero's Realm: Blade Dance activity, on top of a festively themed Fireworks Festival.</p>



<p>As post-launch content goes, it's clear that NetEase and Everstone have hit the ground running, ready to build off the momentum of the game's strong launch. If it can keep up its numbers now that millions of players have already stepped into its world, it could be the next Genshin Impact-level multiplayer action RPG.</p>



<p>For more on Where Winds Meet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">check out Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, who gave the game an 8.5/10, writing, "<em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em>"</p>

			<p>The development of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 began even before the release of <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></a>. Over the past year or so, director Naoki Hamaguchi teased how the experience, likely deeply rooted in the introduction of the Highwind airship, will be different from its predecessors while confirming that <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/"><strong>development was proceeding smoothly.</strong></a> And finally, we are nearing the point at which more information on the highly anticipated game can be shared, the first reportedly coming before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@julienchieze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Julien Chièze</strong></a>, Hamaguchi-san commented on the current development state of the game, confirming that its experience is almost complete as the development team is focusing on fully fleshing out the experience.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"So, honestly, I want everyone to play it as soon as possible, but since it's a game, we must properly finish the detailed work, and only then can we deliver it to the users,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said in regards to when Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 will launch. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So, after properly going through that [fleshing out] phase, we want to deliver it to everyone in a satisfactory form, so if you can just wait a little longer, I believe we will reach the stage where we can deliver various information to everyone,"</em> he added.</p>



<p>Speaking about the game's final name, Hamaguchi-san said that he and Tetsuya Nomura have <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"narrowed down"</em> the options to two, and he expects the final choice to be made before the end of the year.</p>

<p>While it may be too early to see Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 in action, the fact that we are nearing the point when more can be shared about it is definitely exciting. As for when this moment will arrive, it's not easy to say. Though unlikely if the game's name hasn't been finalized yet, if an announcement accompanied by the very first footage is coming before the end of the year, this week's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Game Awards</strong></a> would be the perfect occasion to begin the marketing cycle for one of the most anticipated JRPGs of the next few years.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't see the light of day anytime soon, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S owners who did not have the chance to play the Remake trilogy yet will finally get their chance next year, starting with Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade, which<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/"> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">launches this January on the Nintendo and Microsoft current-generation systems.</strong></a> The other two entries in the trilogy will also launch on both systems in the future.</p>
