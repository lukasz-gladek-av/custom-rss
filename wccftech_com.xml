			<p>Templar Media is a new publisher in the video game industry that was founded earlier this year by John Gibson, former chief executive officer of the publisher and developer Tripwire Interactive. Templar Media's first published title is set to be Gate Zero, a time-travelling action-adventure game where you can "<em>play the Bible</em>," <a href="https://gatezero.game/">according to its website</a>, and today Templar Media announced it would be doing more than just publishing Gate Zero;<a href="https://templarmedia.com/templar-media-acquires-gate-zero-developer-bible-x-cementing-commitment-to-entertainment-first"> it will acquire the studio making the game, Bible X</a>.</p>



<p>Gibson, you might recall, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/">stepped down from Tripwire Interactive in 2021</a> after the studio received significant backlash due to Gibson sharing his views on abortion on X (formerly Twitter) and advocating in favour of the abortion ban that, at the time, had recently been passed by Texas.</p>



<p>Within hours of Gibson sharing his views, studios that had previously worked with Tripwire had made public statements that they would be cutting off ties to the publisher. A few short days after the tweet, Tripwire announced that Gibson would be stepping down.</p>

<p>After all that, for Gibson to return with a studio called 'Templar Media,' and for the first game it publishes to be a game by a studio called Bible X, a studio they are now acquiring as they work on a game where you play as a rebellious teenager from the future who is mistakenly sent back in time and experiences Biblical stories first-hand is perhaps one of the least surprising elements of 2025.</p>



<p>All that said, it's not like Gibson, his team, and Bible X are making a game that only they want to see. Gate Zero raised $330,000 in a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the game across 4,145 donations, and over $6 million euros raised through separate donations. That's nothing to sneeze at. </p>



<p>"<em>From the moment we saw Gate Zero, we knew it had enormous potential as a high quality game that was being created for a massive, yet underserved gaming audience,</em>" said Gibson in the acquisition announcement. "<em>With this acquisition we can now apply the full experience, support and resources of Templar Media into creating the incredible ‘Entertainment First’ experience that gamers worldwide have been asking for.</em>"</p>

<p>Arve Solli, Bible X studio head, added, "<em>As proven by the commercial success of TV and movies like </em><em>The Chosen</em> and <em>The King of Kings</em>, there’s a massive audience seeking top-tier content that explores their values. With Gate Zero, we plan to meet that demand with a full-featured, story-rich video game that allows the player to explore the history and stories found in the Bible, in a grounded and historically accurate way."</p>



<p>There's currently no release date for Gate Zero, though it is slated to arrive on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 when it's ready.</p>
