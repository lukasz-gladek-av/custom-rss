			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake may not be in development, but Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii, one of the main scenario writers and designers of the classic role-playing game, is "contemplating" developing one.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-yuji-horii-contemplating-a-chrono-trigger-remake-1540193/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameReactor</a>, the beloved developer mentioned that it has been a long time since the original was released and that he definitely wants to do something with it. As he has received a lot of requests from fans for a Chrono Trigger remake, he is starting to contemplate it, suggesting that it would be an HD-2D remake and not a full-blown 3D remake in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy.</p>
<p>Besides talking about the possibility of a Chrono Trigger remake, the Dragon Quest series creator also commented on the <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yuji-horiis-best-tribute-to-the-late-akira-toriyama-we-can-make-a-next-title-using-what-he-had-left-1540733/">future of the series</a> in relation to Akira Toriyama's unfortunate passing. After remarking on how he was shocked at learning that Toriyama-san had passed away, Horii-san revealed that he had left many things before he passed, and he believes that another entry in the series can use what he left to ensure some continuity with the rest of the franchise.</p>
<p data-start="142" data-end="587"><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">Last week</a>, it truly seemed like a Chrono Trigger remake was in development, as Yuji Horii reportedly confirmed it during this year's Napoli COMICON. However, expectations were quickly dashed when it was clarified that the statement was a misunderstanding caused by an interpreter error. Still, given recent statements, there's reason to remain hopeful, even if it may be some time before we can embark once again on one of the most epic journeys through time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-strategy-publishers-baffled-no-xbox-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The current Xbox multiplatform strategy is leaving certain publishers and developers baffled, so much so that they no longer see the need to develop Xbox versions of their games, considering the consolidated PlayStation dominance on the market.</p>
<p>Speaking during a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgCII8nnKHg&amp;t=1150s"> recent podcast</a>, The Game Business's co-founder Christopher Dring commented on the current situation of the console market, highlighting how, with Xbox's multiplatform strategy, PlayStation is the dominant player more than ever before in the console space. Almost every Xbox game launching this year is also coming to PlayStation 5 at launch, like DOOM: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>. Only Avowed and South of Midnight did not launch on PlayStation 5 this year, but they could be the final Xbox console exclusives for the time being.</p>
<p>While the Xbox multiplatform strategy could be paying off in some way, as Microsoft's published games on PlayStation 5 are doing quite well, certain publishers and developers are reportedly baffled. From their point of view, they want the competition in the console space, and if Microsoft is releasing their games at launch on other systems, seemingly leaving their hardware behind, they don't see the need to create Xbox versions of games. As such, Christopher Dring highlighted, Microsoft will have to strike a balance in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Has Xboxâ€™s Call of Duty Game Pass gamble paid off?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgCII8nnKHg?start=1150&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the current multiplatform strategy seems to suggest otherwise, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles won't be the last gaming systems by Microsoft. The company is hard at work on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include an Xbox-branded handheld in development together with ASUS, of which we saw the first images <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/">earlier this week,</a> a full-fledged handheld system and a proper home console that will be the successor to the Xbox Series X and that will deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical&nbsp;leap to date</a>. With the current market conditions being so challenging, however, plans could definitely change, and it will be very interesting to see how the big console manufacturers will manage to overcome all these hurdles that are making gaming a very expensive hobby.</p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some Steam Deck and PC-specific fixes alongside other improvements and balance changes.</p>
<p>The 1.2.3 patch introduces a minor Steam Deck improvement, fixing backgrounds of various menus not displaying correctly on the system, as well as various ultrawide resolutions fixes, including gameplay no longer becoming zoomed after a cutscene, combat UI not properly adapting to ultrawide resolutions, cutscenes no longer getting letterboxed in 32:9 ratio, and more. Mouse and Keyboard controls also received some improvements, such as UI button prompts in the Expedition Menu now being fully visible and triggered with Keyboard, mouse button remaining responsive after first use, and more.</p>
<p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also packs some fixes for areas where characters would get stuck on the world map, situations where Esquie would get stuck, and some balance changes. The skill that saw the most significant change is Maelle's Stendhal, which was extremely powerful in the previous version of the game, and could be easily used to one-shot even the most powerful bosses with the proper setup. You can learn more about every change the patch brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499446847117461384?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-1-will-continue-to-be-supported-with-new-games-by-nintendo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the imminent launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the Japanese company will continue to support the older console with new games. The confirmation arrived with <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's latest quarterly financial report</a>, which included the following statement:</p>
<p><em>These are first-party titles for Nintendo Switch that have already been announced: PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (2025), PokÃ©mon Champions (TBD). In the Nintendo Direct held this March, we announced plans to release the titles Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream in 2026.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Going forward, we will continue to bring out new titles for the over 100 million people worldwide who are playing Nintendo Switch.</em></p>
<p>The console's hardware sales have unsurprisingly declined year-over-year. Whereas in fiscal year 2024 Nintendo sold in (to retailers) 15.70 million units, fiscal year 2025 hardware sales stopped at 10.80 million units, a 31.2% drop. Cumulative sell-through (to consumers) lifetime sales are approaching 150 million units.</p>
<p>With such a huge install base, second only in the all-time console hardware charts to Sony's PlayStation 2 (the best-selling console of all time with over 160 million units sold), it's no wonder that Nintendo wants to keep making games for the Switch. At the same time, Nintendo also understands the importance of making exclusive titles to push consumers to buy the new Switch 2 when it lands on June 5. For instance, Mario Kart World <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will only be available on the new console</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be making the switch (pun entirely intended) right away, or will you keep playing with the previous console for some time? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			<p>Following yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release date confirmation</a>, new trailer, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAX East developer panel</a>, Hangar 13 also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the minimum and recommended system requirements for the PC version of Mafia: The Old Country.</p>
<div><p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>

<div><p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 / 11</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 7 5800X / Intel Core i7-12700K</em></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The game runs on Epic's Unreal Engine 5, having moved off the proprietary engine previously used in Mafia III and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a>. Because of that, some concerns regarding the often-present stuttering are inevitable. However, the game is not an open world, unlike previous entries in the franchise. Hangar 13 has instead chosen to go with a linear, narrative-driven experience, as explained by studio president Nick Baynes:</p>
<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay. That focus allows us to deliver a story thatâ€™s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi's crime family.</em></p>
<p>Without the need to stream in a large, explorable world, stuttering issues could be less problematic than in <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. Of course, we won't know for sure until the game launches on August 8.</p>
<p>What we do know is that Mafia: The Old Country <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be available to stream via NVIDIA GeForce NOW on day one</a> for all those players whose PCs do not meet the above system requirements.</p>

			<p>In a Japanese press release <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/897/G089776/20250508027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by 4Gamer</a>, SEGA (the game's publisher in Japan) and Avalanche Software have revealed some technical details of the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enhanced Visuals</em></strong><br>
<em>Experience deeper immersion with significantly upgraded graphics, including NVIDIA DLSS support, improved lighting and shadow animation quality, and anti-aliasing. Experience up to 1440p resolution in TV mode and 1080p and HDR in handheld mode.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Smooth Movement</em></strong><br>
<em>Move seamlessly through the open world, including Hogsmeade and its shops, without loading screens.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Smooth Flight</em></strong><br>
<em>Thanks to the improved performance of the Nintendo Switch 2, not only is the frame rate higher than the Nintendo Switch version, but the loading times are also shorter. You can fly around the Hogwarts grounds and beyond comfortably.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Supports mouse operation with Joy-Con 2</em></strong><br>
<em>Supports mouse operation with Joy-Con 2 controller. Enjoy your preferred play style.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution</a>, but developers can choose whether to actually use it or not. It honestly seems like a no-brainer, though, especially for games that have already implemented the feature on the PC version, like Hogwarts Legacy or <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 also technically supports ray tracing, but there's no mention of it being implemented in this game, even though the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions (and, of course, the PC version) support it. Indeed, it's highly unlikely that open world games will implement ray tracing in any capacity on the hybrid console, as it would simply be too taxing on the hardware. It could, however, be supported for simpler, smaller games. Anyway, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Hogwarts Legacy will be available at the console's launch (June 5). The game size is 24 GB.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Europa Universalis V Announced by Paradox]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/europa-universalis-v-announced-by-paradox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/europa-universalis-v-announced-by-paradox.1185006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/europa-universalis-v-announced-by-paradox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Paradox Interactive unveiled Europa Universalis V, a new installment in the popular grand strategy game. Fans have been waiting for this since Europa Universalis IV launched in 2013. In that regard, they've waited as long as GTA fans.</p>
<p>Europa Universalis V promises more detailed diplomacy, a more sophisticated economic model, a revamped military system, and greater logistical depth. According to Paradox, it offers the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>New and Larger Map: Start as a mighty emperor, local chieftain, or warlord in a more detailed and accurate world map with hundreds of playable societies and varied terrain.</li>
<li>Longer Time Scale: Begin in 1337 and guide a nation through centuries of historical change, including the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and other historical ages.</li>
<li>Population-Based System: Rule over detailed populations with cultural, religious, and class dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is particularly interesting, as the developers are touting that populations are represented on the map in detail for the first time in the franchise. This means provinces may be divided by religion or culture. The player's choices will determine how these populations fare under their leadership.</p>
<p><iframe title="Europa Universalis V - Official Announcement Show" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaZcN-eVta8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Europa Universalis V doesn't have a release date yet, but you can already add the game to your Steam wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right here</a>.</p>
