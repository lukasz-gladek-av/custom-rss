			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro brings considerable visual and performance improvements in several titles, including Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 remake, Demon's Souls, and others.</p>
<p>In the tests conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel/videos">Brazil Pixel</a>, the latest two entries in the CAPCOM survival horror series powered by the RE Engine show considerable performance improvements. Resident Evil Village, for example, runs at locked 120 frames per second in HFR without ray tracing at 1080p resolution, which is quite impressive to see on a console in a relatively recent game. The Resident Evil 4 remake, on the other hand, doesn't reach the same locked 120 FPS frame rate but does run close to 100 FPS in Frame Rate Mode without ray tracing, which is still quite impressive.</p>

<p>In a Tekken 8 quick test, Brazil Pixel also showed how the raw power of the PlayStation 5 Pro can boost games that use dynamic resolution even without a dedicated patch. Unfortunately, not every game can take full advantage of the console's power, such as Rise of the Ronin, which still suffers from performance issues even on the new system.</p>

<p>Among the games that were updated to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's power and features is also the Demon's Souls remake by Bluepoint Games. The recently released PS5 Pro patch introduces material-displaced contact shadows for all dynamic lights and 4K, 60 FPS support via PSSR upscaling, which makes one of the best-looking PS5 games to date look even better. These improvements can be seen in action in the comparison video below, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, BioWare <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/4453590197273100466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> patch after the game's launch on October 31. The patch, around 1GB in size, is largely focused on a variety of bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where DLSS options could end up “grayed-out” on a 40-series Nvidia GPU.</li>

<li>Updated XeSS version to 1.3.1.</li>

<li>Harding now has arrows in her quiver and is ready for battle.</li>
<li>Global banter should no longer start too early.</li>
<li>Harding and Taash banter no longer repeats indefinitely.</li>

<li>Updated a number of assets to improve visual performance over long distances.</li>
<li>Fixed several distance “pop-ins” on level art assets.</li>
<li>Added collision to several assets that were missing it.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor texture issue with codex art.</li>
<li>Added haptics to a number of interactions and events.</li>
<li>Fixed lip sync in some ambient scenes.</li>
<li>Adjusted audio balance on several Dragon Age: The Veilguard assets.</li>
<li>Changing equipment no longer disables helmet voice processing.</li>
<li>Fixed several objective markers that were spawning improperly.</li>
<li>Cleaned up certain interactions between Skills that caused them to not behave as described.</li>
<li>Apparitions generated by Iron Veil will now attack</li>
<li>Entropic Spheres now behave properly on vertical surfaces.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Taunt would sometimes be cleared early, which caused enemies to ignore it.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where Rogues would not hold their bow while aiming down sights.</li>
<li>Made the detailed-stats screen more readable.</li>
<li>Balance changes made to certain fights to match design intent.</li>
<li>Balance adjustments made to several player skills.</li>
<li>Fixed leashing exploits on major encounters.</li>
<li>The Rage Demon’s Ring of Fire should now be appropriately dodgeable in all situations.</li>
<li>Slowed down the speedy raven in Hossberg.</li>
<li>Adjusted creepy corpse movement while they moved on/off-camera.</li>
<li>The Dalish elf in the Unwanted Guests quest is now an actual elf.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare blocking issue in the Sea of Blood quest.</li>
<li>Halla should no longer float during the In Entropy’s Grasp quest.</li>
<li>Fixed a blocking issue in the Pinnacle of Its Kind quest.</li>
<li>Adjusted timing on epilogue text cards.</li>
<li>NPC necks no longer grow unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Corrected instances where Dragon Age: The Veilguard NPCs would not properly look at each other or at Rook.</li>
<li>Long hair should now properly mesh with certain armor.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with makeup in character creation.</li>
<li>Venatori crystal VFX should now disappear properly.</li>
<li>Added scroll wheel support to the sell screen.</li>
<li>Opening the journal while on the map no longer causes it to continue scrolling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, BioWare also added a Mass Effect themed cosmetic armor to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is entirely appropriate since the patch dropped on N7 Day. You'll find the armor in a new chest near the Caretaker's Workshop in the Lighthouse, on the condition that you have completed Harding's mission called The Singing Blade.&nbsp;That wasn't the only news Mass Effect fans got yesterday, by the way: there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV series in development at Amazon Prime Video.</a></p>
<p>As for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the game peaked on Steam at 89.4K concurrent users last weekend. We'll see if it can top that this coming weekend.</p>

			<p>As part of its Q2 FY 2025 financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20241108_q2_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>, SEGA has announced the sale of Amplitude Studios, the Paris-based studio known as the developer of Endless Space, Endless Legend, Dungeon of the Endless,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/endless-space-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Endless Space 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/humankind-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humankind</a>, and more recently, Endless Dungeon.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast.1030632/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has reported its Q2 2024 financial results today, revealing that its PS5 console has now reached 65.5 million units sold. Hardware sales were slightly down year-over-year: whereas 3.8 million PlayStation 5 consoles were sold this past quarter, Q2 2023 saw 4.9 million PS5s sold.</p>
<p>However, this was more than offset by the increased sales elsewhere in the PlayStation department. For example, game software for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles reached 77.7 million units sold this quarter, a 14.94% increase compared to Q2 2023's 67.6 million units. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/sony-s-music-lineup-and-image-sensors-deliver-profit-beat?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, this was largely because of the outstanding success of Game Science's action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, which is said to have sold around 20 million units (though that includes the PC version). Team Asobi's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a> also performed rather well, selling 1.5 million units as of November 3, which is around two months after its launch.&nbsp;Even network services were more profitable for Sony. The PlayStation Plus subscriber base remained at 116 million monthly active users (MAUs), just like in Q1 2024; it was at 107 million units in Q2 2023.</p>
<p>The highly positive Q2 2024 led Sony to revise its gaming forecast upward for the full fiscal year results. Sales have been upped by 4% compared to August's estimate, mainly due to increased sales from third-party games, while PlayStation's operating income has been revised upward by 11%, also thanks to an improvement in hardware profitability.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Sony's fiscal year ends on March 31. As such, it will certainly benefit from big releases like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Monster Hunter Wilds, both slated for February 2025. But it's the next fiscal year that could be massive for PS5 game and hardware sales, with heavyweights like Borderlands 4, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Mafia: The Old Country, Ghost of Yōtei, and of course, Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>The latter, in particular, could help the console catch up to its predecessor (it's currently trailing behind since the PS4 had sold 67.7 million units at the same point in its lifecycle). The impact of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released PS5 Pro console</a> also has yet to be seen, with Sony hoping it will account for around 20% of the sales from now on, just like the PS4 Pro.</p>
