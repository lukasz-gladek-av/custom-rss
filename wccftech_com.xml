			<p>Ubisoft is reportedly considering launching a new venture that will hold some of the company's most popular IPs, and that could be part-owned by other companies besides shareholder Tencent.</p>
<p>According to a new report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the French publisher is looking to establish a new entity that will include some of the publisher's biggest IPs, like the Assassin's Creed series, and is considering selling a minority stake in this new venture. Potential bidders, who have already been contacted and asked for preliminary bids before the end of the month, include current Ubisoft shareholder Tencent. Everything, however, is still under consideration, and plans could change, according to people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard that Ubisoft is considering<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-founding-family-and-tencent-are-considering-a-new-venture-using-some-of-ubisofts-assets/"> starting this new venture</a> that would hold some of its most lucrative IPs. Back in January, however, it seemed like only Tencent would be involved in this new venture which would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the publisher.</p>
<p>While it hasn't been said outright, there's little doubt that Assassin's Creed Shadows' performance on the market will have a big impact on Ubisoft's future. The new entry in the series set in Feudal Japan, which is said to be the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">visually advanced entry in the series to date</a>, will launch next week on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
