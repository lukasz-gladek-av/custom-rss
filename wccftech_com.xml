			<p>The long-rumored Final Fantasy Tactics remaster could be announced during today's PlayStation State of Play, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>Shortly after the announcement of the new presentation that will air later today, as reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-might-be-teasing-an-upcoming-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-announcement-plus-yasumi-matsuno-retweeted-the-state-of-play-tweet.1206009/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Yasumi Matsuno, director and writer of the game, retweeted the announcement, suggesting that something he has worked on would be shown during the presentation, later deleting the retweet. In addition, well-known reporter Jason Schreier talked about the game shortly after the announcement of the State of Play on Bluesky, later correcting a user talking about a remake, saying that it is a remaster.</p>

<p>The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster has been rumored for a long time, and there's very little doubt that it is real and coming at some point. The game was originally revealed alongside a slew of other Square Enix projects via a massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/">GeForce NOW leak</a>, and every leaked title from the publisher eventually turned out to be real, except for the Final Fantasy IX remake, which has yet to be announced, much like the Final Fantasy Tactics Remaster.</p>
<p>Despite rumors of its development making the rounds for years, we have no idea if the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster will be a simple remaster, or something in the vein of Tactics Ogre Reborn, which introduced a lot of gameplay changes that ultimately make the remaster a more enjoyable experience than the PSP release, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tactics-ogre-reborn-review/">review</a>. Hopefully, it won't take too long to learn more about this, and if one infamous character will end up making every other unit obsolete when he joins Ramza in his quest as he does in the original PlayStation release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-hotfix-display-driver-576-66-fixes-crashes-in-dune-awakening-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-ea-sports-fc-25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, NVIDIA released a new GeForce Hotfix Display Driver (version 576.66). This hotfix resolves crashing issues in popular games that are already out, such as the football game EA Sports FC 25 and the turn-based JRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, as well as the upcoming survival MMO-like game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a>, which will officially launch on June 10 but will be playable starting tomorrow for those who purchased the Deluxe or Ultimate edition.</p>
<p>There are a couple more things in this GeForce Hotfix Display Driver release, as you can read from the official changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune: Awakening may crash during gameplay [5273568]</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25 may crash during gameplay [5251937]</li>
<li>[RTX 50 series] Dragons Dogma 2 displays shadow flicker [5252205]</li>
<li>[RTX 50 series] Video playback in a web browser may show brief red/green flash corruption [5241341]</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may crash [5283401]</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike regular GeForce Game Ready drivers, a GeForce Hotfix Display Driver cannot be downloaded via GeForce Experience or the recently released NVIDIA app. You'll have to get it manually <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5667" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from this support page on NVIDIA's website</a>. Of course, if you're not encountering those issues and/or are not playing those games, you can skip the download. It will be rolled into the next major GeForce Game Ready driver release anyway, which is probably not far off.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update is now available, bringing a small number of improvements to the system.</p>
<p>As a minor update, system software 25.04-11.40.00 doesn't introduce any major new features, focusing on improving message and usability on some screens, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official update notes</a> shared on the PlayStation official website. No other change or improvement is mentioned, so we will have to wait for the next update for the usual<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-01-10-60-00/"> system stability improvements</a> often implemented in system software updates.</p>
<p>The latest major PlayStation 5 system software update went live back in April, bringing back the beloved PlayStation 30th anniversary UI some months after it went live and was later taken down when the 30th anniversary celebrations ended. The 25.03-11.20.00 also introduced the Audio Focus feature, a feature only available when using headphones that supports broader accessibility and allows players to hear quiet sounds and voice chat more clearly in games. Rounding up the changes and improvements introduced in the latest major update were the usual system software performance and stability improvements.</p>
<p>The new PlayStation 5 system software update 25.04-11.40.00 will be downloaded by the system automatically.&nbsp;<span>You can download the latest system software update&nbsp;<a href="https://pc.ps5.update.playstation.net/update/ps5/official/tJMRE80IbXnE9YuG0jzTXgKEjIMoabr6/image/2025_0529/sys_c81ab2031ccdaec9c83dcb1918d5051e3c6e988a5c6dba135cf238aa944072ed/PS5UPDATE.PUP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>if you want to update it manually</span>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1929890398236774904" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to insider Tom Henderson, Sony might announce a new God of War game later today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Play live stream</a>. However, this won't be the next installment in the main series; on the other hand, the report says it will be a 2.5D Metroidvania-inspired game set in ancient Greece. Henderson even added that it sounds smaller scale than he previously thought, so don't expect a sizable experience.</p>
<p>Still, it could be an interesting one, not unlike Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. That game was successful among critics (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 9/10 score here on Wccftech) and fans, but it <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did not sell enough to warrant a sequel.</a> In the case of God of War, it might be a stopgap release while Sony Santa Monica is busy with something else.</p>
<p>As far as we know, they have two main teams, and their next release from Cory Barlog's team is <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-developer-might-be-making-a-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be a new IP, possibly set in a sci-fi universe. Of course, there will eventually be a new mainline God of War game, but it wouldn't be too surprising if it only arrived on PlayStation 6, given the increasingly long development times of a triple-A game.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there were also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that Sony Santa Monica would be remastering the Greek trilogy. It is unclear whether that was indeed true and the announcement has been delayed, or perhaps insiders got slightly misleading information and their sources were referring to this 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off instead. Regardless, we should learn more about it in around twelve hours or so.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the developer is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> with Amazon Prime Video on a live action TV series adaptation of the Norse trilogy. However, production was delayed due to a major change: showrunner Rafe Judkins was <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-starts-from-scratch-with-battlestar-galactica-for-all-mankind-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by Ronald D. Moore, who is credited for Star Trek: Next Generation, Battlestar Galactica, For All Mankind, and Outlander.</p>

			<p>British developer Jagex announced a round of layoffs. Community Manager JagexHooli <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1l1fut4/comment/mvkxroe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it earlier this week with the following Reddit comment:</p>
<p><em>Yes, there have unfortunately been job reductions at Jagex. These have been made as part of changes in a company restructure as Jagex puts more emphasis on RuneScape games and community growth. The majority of roles are from non-game dev and non-player facing areas. There are some exceptions within the RS team as part the company's focus on a streamlined development approach.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sure many of you are concerned about what this means for RuneScape 3. This is not a change in direction from what Mod North has said before – we are still committed to growing this game and investing in it. Our Roadmap won’t change because of these job reductions, and we’ll continue the great path we’ve been on with our content. We will talk to you about this when the time is right.</em></p>
<p><em>What matters most right now are the people affected by this change. The studio’s focus is to support those affected, as is mine. Now is the time we put them first and do everything we can to help them out.</em></p>
<p>At the same time, work on 'Project Zanaris', whose objective was to allow private servers for Old School RuneScape, has been paused. On this note, Jagex <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/pausing-project-zanaris--whats-next?oldschool=1#_ga=2.197087977.499468828.1749024097-1248850839.1749024095" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>After careful consideration, we've decided to pause work on Zanaris indefinitely. We're committed to delivering the best possible Old School RuneScape experience. With a renewed focus and continued support from our incredible team, we're excited to keep making OSRS even better for everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that feelings around the project were mixed, and many of the concerns raised were fair. The truth is, there are other areas of the core Old School experience that deserve more attention right now. While Zanaris was ambitious and innovative, it wouldn't have met expectations until much later in development. Rather than stretch our focus, we want to prioritise the things that matter most to you today.</em></p>
<p>Jagex recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a survival cooperative multiplayer game, on Steam Early Access. According to Steam data, it was purchased by 550K, 789K, or 842K users, depending on the analytics website (VG Insights, Gamalytic, PlayTracker).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-how-to-capture-creatures/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>You'll do a lot of collecting in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, including collecting the creatures you discover while roaming the four main planets you visit across the game's story. In some cases, capturing and researching these creatures is essential to your progression in the game.</p>
<p>So, how do you capture creatures? Some of the exact details for each creature change the process slightly, but the rules are mostly the same. This guide will show you how to capture creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, so you'll be prepared for anything that has the misfortune of being in your way.</p>
<h2>Revenge Of The Savage Planet - How To Capture Creatures</h2>
<p>Before we get into the how of capturing creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, you'll need to make sure you've already collected your whip. Without it, you can't capture anything. You'll also want to make sure that you're not surrounded by plenty of other creatures that will be hostile towards you.</p>
<p>Any interruption means you restart the process, so it's good to single out one creature to capture at a time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you have a creature you want to capture in your sights, the very first thing you'll want to do is scan it. Jump into scanning mode, and give it a scan, even if you've already scanned that species. The info box that will appear next to it will remind you of anything you need to be aware of when engaging and trying to capture that creature.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>What you do next will depend on the size of the creature you're trying to capture. Most creatures will require you to stun them in some way, usually by hitting a weak spot with your blaster. Others don't need that kind of preamble. You can just hold your whip button until you're swinging it over your head like a lasso. You'll be able to tell if it can be captured if a small circle appears on the creature, signifying that your whip is locked on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Once you've locked onto the creature, release your whip and you'll start a small tug-of-war mini-game with the creature. Just keep the whip button held, and so long as you're not interrupted, you'll pull the creature close enough to capture it.</li>
</ul>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/">Empty Vessel</a>, the studio founded by former id Software developers and comprised of people who've worked on Doom, The Last of Us, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Uncharted, and more, has just closed out its series A round of funding for its debut project, DEFECT, with&nbsp;<strong>$11 million</strong> total raised from this round.</p>
<p>The additional funds will allow Empty Vessel to expand the team, per a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/emptyvessel-Expands-DEFECT-Game-Development-with-Series-A-Close">press release</a>, and scale to the point where they can work on bringing DEFECT to consoles, and add support for single-player experiences on top of DEFECT already being a multiplayer-focused game.</p>
<p>When we last heard about DEFECT and Empty Vessel, it was with news that NCSOFT had made "<em>a strategic equity investment</em>" in the studio to help DEFECT get out the door, so it's no surprise that NCSOFT was one of the companies that led this series A round of funding, alongside 1AM Gaming, and Black Phoenix Games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Official Reveal Trailer (Unreal In Engine) | Wishlist Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IScUN3ZYeR8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>It's gratifying to see our developer-first approach resonating with fans and our new long-term partners at NCSOFT alongside our other investors</em>," said chief executive officer at Empty Vessel and game director on DEFECT, Emmanuel Palalic.</p>
<p>"<em>We remain committed to our vision of creating a new genre in the FPS market with DEFECT, and while we are building in a sustainable manner, this new investment will allow us to accelerate our plans for proper single-player support and to expand onto more platforms</em>."</p>
<p>For NCSOFT, the chief executive officer of NC America, and chief operating officer of NC West, Jeonghee 'JJ' Jin added "<em>Empty Vessel's distinct vision for game design, production, and player interaction made us quick believers in their upcoming shooter, DEFECT. We're committed to the evolution and future of this incredible game</em>."</p>
<p>1AM Gaming's managing director, Gregory Milken added "<em>We believe that Empty Vessel is a unique studio working on an amazing game, so we are thrilled to join them as a key investor as they work towards bringing a fresh perspective for first person shooter games with DEFECT</em>."</p>
