			<p>Bethesda showed even more support to the Skyblivion mod team, and invited them to tour Bethesda Studios headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. The Skyblivion team shared the excursion with <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1923793664112726161">a post on X</a>, with photos from the studio and with developers from Bethesda, including Todd Howard, thanking the studio for having them and showing them around.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you to our friends Bethesda Studios for having us over and showing us around!</em>" the post reads. "<em>Meeting the legendary people behind some of our favorite games was incredible and was only matched by their shared enthusiasm for Skyblivion and the modding community</em>."</p>
<p>It's the latest show of support after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">Bethesda gifted the entire Skyblivion team game keys</a> for the recently released Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p>If you weren't aware, Skyblivion is a total conversion mod effort to take The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and recreate it in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It's been in development for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/">more than eight years</a>, and is finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">due to release sometime in 202</a>5, though it'll just be the base Oblivion game on launch, with the Oblivion DLCs due to come sometime later.</p>
<p>When the Oblivion Remaster was first spotted online, ahead of it being officially revealed, Wccftech reached out to the Skyblivion team, who had no ill-will towards the work that Bethesda was doing in its own remastering of Oblivion.</p>
<p>"<em>For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster,</em>" said the Skyblivion team lead Rebelzize.</p>
<p>"<em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different from what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing [Skyblivion] was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-says-his-stealth-game-physint-is-%E2%80%9Cfive-or-six%E2%80%9D-years-from-release.1192962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-plans-to-continue-making-games-in-some-way-even-after-he-has-passed-away/">Hideo Kojima</a> and Kojima Productions next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-could-last-nearly-twice-as-much-as-the-original-has-more-combat-because-people-ask-kojima-for-mgs/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is due to release in a little more than a month. After that, it's anyone's guess as to when the next games we know Kojima has cooking, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-return-to-stealth-physint-spurred-by-brush-with-death/">Physint</a>, are going to hit store shelves.</p>
<p>Kojima's guess, at least regarding Physint, is that we won't see its release for another "<em>five or six years</em>." That's what he told French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/">Le Film Français</a> in a recent interview (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/">VGC</a>), when talking about his future projects, and aspirations to make movies, now that Death Stranding 2 is nearly out the door.</p>
<p>"<em>Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development. That will take me another five or six years. Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film. I grew up with cinema. Directing would be a kind of homage to it. Besides, I'm getting older, and I would prefer to do it while still young.</em>"</p>
<p>Kojima doesn't talk about OD, so perhaps OD is right in the middle of the five-to-six-year period, or it'll come afterward, with him working on OD alongside his first big film project. That's all just speculation, but unless we're due to hear that OD has been canceled, it arguably has to be somewhere in the next decade.</p>
<p>I mean, realistically, how much longer will Kojima keep working? He's currently 61, and if his estimation for Physint is correct, then he's technically also just confirmed the first cross-generational release between PS5 and PS6, unless, of course, the PS5 sticks around for more than a decade. And by that time, he'll be 67, looking to start directing movies, and maybe even still working on OD.</p>
<p>This all puts even more importance on Death Stranding 2. Whether you like Kojima's work or not, he's been one of the video game industry's most influential creators for years now. DS2 is officially one of the last game's we'll see from Hideo Kojima, and marks the closing of an era in video games with him officially looking at the exit door, even if he's not yet put a foot over the edge.</p>

			<p>Today, at Computex 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now available in over 125 games and applications. Following the news, NVIDIA provided more details and trailers about upcoming games and existing PC games that are being updated to include DLSS 4 and other NVIDIA technologies.</p>
<p>Let's start with Portal with RTX, which was upgraded from DLSS 3.5 to the new version while also updating the Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction models to the latest and greatest versions. Additionally, the game now supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Cache</a>. Taking advantage of the neural shader's capabilities to leverage AI to infer a great many rays and bounces from a limited set of indirect lights, the performance is improved even further. The flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, runs Portal with RTX at 277 average frames per second with full ray tracing enabled, according to NVIDIA tests. The RTX 5080 registers 171.5 frames per second, while the RTX 5070Ti achieves 143.7 frames per second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal with RTX | Improved Performance with DLSS 4 &amp; NRC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyS3TtOC7hA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tomorrow, Saber Interactive will release Roadcraft, a rather unusual game where players will use construction machinery to restore sites damaged by various natural disasters. The game includes DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution (with the transformer AI model), and DLAA on day one. NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation can be enabled via the NVIDIA app overrides and will be added in-game soon. As seen in the trailer, Roadcraft runs at over 250 average frames per second with everything enabled on the RTX 5090.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoadCraft | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXDtRgeXrvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two days later, 1047 Games will launch SplitGate 2's Open Beta, which also features integration of the whole DLSS 4 suite: Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p>On the same day, the popular free-to-play melee-focused Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint will receive the <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously announced</a> path tracing update, greatly improving its visuals. The game already supported DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, but this update will also introduce Ray Reconstruction. In the NVIDIA trailer, the game runs at around 350 average frames per second with everything enabled.</p>
<p><iframe title="NARAKA: BLADEPOINT | Full Ray Tracing &amp; DLSS Ray Reconstruction Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElOkr-bhS2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>In early June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> will be released with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation (which was not yet available in the recent beta), Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex. The NVIDIA trailer shows the game running at over 300 frames per second in some instances.</p>

<p>The same technologies will be available in MindsEye, the single player triple-A action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 10</a>.</p>
<p>A week later, Remedy's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-preview-hands-on-with-remedys-first-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> will make its debut with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, DLAA, Reflex, and path tracing.

<p>Lastly, Crimson Desert will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Reflex, and ray traced effects. Kyungjoon Cho, Head of Game Engine System Division, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Crimson Desert represents a major step forward for Pearl Abyss in intense action and open world design. With NVIDIA's graphics technologies, we're ensuring that players experience and explore the continent of Pywel through high-quality graphics and smooth gameplay.</em></p>
<p>Keita Iida, Vice President of Developer Relations at NVIDIA, added:</p>
