			<p>Rumors about the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware supporting NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and ray tracing features have been circulating since 2023, based on the assumption that the underlying chipset would be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Tegra 239 SoC</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, though, Nintendo did not mention these features at all <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the Direct</a> or in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-development-began-before-2019-super-nintendo-switch-was-considered-as-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequent article</a> posted on the official website. After the showcase, the folks at Digital Foundry went through the released footage of Nintendo Switch 2 games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-footage-no-dlss-ps4-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> there was no indication of NVIDIA DLSS being featured in those games, casting further doubts on what seemed like a certainty.</p>
<p>Now, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has got Nintendo on the record about the subject</a>. Takuhiro Dohta, senior director at Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Division and one of three people seen in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, revealed:</p>
<p><em>We use DLSS upscaling technology and that's something that we need to use as we develop games. And when it comes to the hardware, it is able to output to a TV at a max of 4K. Whether the software developer is going to use that as a native resolution or get it to upscale is something that the software developer can choose. I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer to choose from.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, the GPU does support ray tracing. As with DLSS, I believe this provides yet another option for the software developers to use and a tool for them.</em></p>
<p>When IGN tried to obtain further details about the GPU included in the Nintendo Switch 2, Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo's Technology Development Division and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, replied that Nintendo does not like to discuss the finer technical details. However, Sasaki-san added that NVIDIA should share more information&nbsp;at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Based on previously rumored information, the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU should be powered by NVIDIA's Ampere architecture and feature 2048 CUDA Cores, while its 8-core CPU should include 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores. Earlier this year, a leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the Switch 2 is capable of 1.71 TFLOPS in handheld mode with a GPU clocked at 561 MHz, while the docked mode (which, as Nintendo has confirmed, is boosted by a fan this time around) can go up to 3.1 TFLOPS thanks to the higher GPU speed of 1000 MHz.</p>
<p>We'll find out if these leaks were correct soon enough.</p>
