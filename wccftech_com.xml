			<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> that a PC version of Stellar Blade was on the way, but now Korean developer Shift Up has confirmed that we can expect it to arrive at some point in 2025. The news comes from the latest investor <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, in which the studio also revealed that its sales estimate for the PC version is higher than the PS5's, considering Steam's large user base and the recent explosive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">success </a>of a similar action game, Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>Shift Up is also planning to expand overseas with a new office to be established in Los Angeles. The company certainly has a lot to invest after the big <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a> worth $320 million they raised in July. However, they also have an ongoing lawsuit to deal with regarding the Stellar Blade IP, as the owner of StellarBlade.com <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> both Shift Up and Sony for trademark infringement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio continues to improve the game. The recent PS5 Pro update <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-playstation-5-pro-max-graphic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> the new Pro and Pro Max graphics presets, both of which support high frame rates. Next week, players can expect a free <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-photo-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> adding Photo Mode and a DLC collaboration with Square Enix's NieR Automata. All of these patches and DLCs are almost assuredly going to be available from day one on PC.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade got a straight 9 in Wccftech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PS5 version penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-timi-studios-mobile-take-on-capcoms-popular-franchise/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-timi-studios-mobile-take-on-capcoms-popular-franchise/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tencent's TiMi Studio has finally pulled the veil from Monster Hunter Outlanders, the mobile game based on CAPCOM's franchise that was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-and-tencents-timi-studio-group-are-creating-a-new-monster-hunter-game-for-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two years ago.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the press release describes the game as an open world survival title. Players will explore and survive throughout unique regions of an open world map featuring natural environments, ecosystems and monsters. They'll get to craft and build custom equipment and tools and participate in the traditional hunting experience, where they can play solo or join a hunting party of up to four people.</p>
<p>TiMi Studio Group Producer Dong Huang said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>It’s time for mobile players to fully enjoy what makes Monster Hunter one of the most beloved franchises in gaming. Monster Hunter Outlanders not only offers players an authentic hunting experience, but it does it in a massive open world featuring the community and social systems players are looking for today.</em></p>

<p>No more information about the game's systems was released today, and no release date has been publicly set, either. The studio, which has a lot of experience adapting big franchises for mobile (they made the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/popular-strategy-game-age-of-empires-is-soon-coming-to-mobile-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires Mobile</a>, as well as the massively successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-immortal-gets-new-dev-update-activision-says-its-justified-by-call-of-duty-mobiles-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty Mobile</a> and the not-quite-as-successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-unite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon UNITE</a>), said multiple playtests will be conducted in advance of the launch of Monster Hunter Outlanders. It is also likely there will be a staggered rollout throughout various regions, as usual for mobile games.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain: it will be a very different experience compared to previous Monster Hunter mobile entries, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-riders-now-available-for-pre-registration-on-ios-and-android-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Riders</a> (which featured turn-based combat, whereas the series is renowned for its action combat) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantics-monster-hunter-now-brings-the-hunt-to-the-real-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Now</a>, a location-based augmented reality game developed by Niantic.</p>
