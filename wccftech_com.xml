			<p>Last week, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">announced that it had cast <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> to play <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Shortly after that, it confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> would be playing <strong>Sif</strong> in the series</a>, which gave us more of an insight into how the show is approaching the God of War story. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/max-parker-cast-god-of-war-heimdall-1236691740/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that <strong>Max Parker</strong> will play <strong>Heimdall</strong>, giving us a bit more insight into the show's story. But it seems that a report from <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qenyu0/potential_god_of_war_tv_casting_leaks/">Reddit</a>, that correctly identified Parker and Palmer's casting, could also be correct about the casting choices for the show's version of <strong>Thor</strong> and <strong>Mimir</strong>.</p>



<p>Parker is the latest actor to join the cast of the God of War TV series, and knowing that he'll be playing Heimdall further confirms what Palmer's casting as Sif already indicated, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be leaning on characters not introduced in the games until <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> to tell this new version of Kratos and Atreus' story.</p>



<p>Which means we likely have more than a few casting announcements yet to come, since we'll likely also get an appearance from characters introduced in Ragnarok like <strong>Odin</strong> and <strong>Tyr</strong>. There's also still characters from <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> that have yet to be cast, including <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, but if NerdBot is correct, the next announcements we're likely to see will be the casting for Thor and Mimir.</p>



<p>For Thor, the proposed choice is <strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll likely recognzie from the hit Apple TV+ show, <strong>Severance</strong>, while for Mimir, it seems that Amazon doesn't want to fix what isn't broken, as the NerdBot report claims that <strong></strong><strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as Mimir for the show.</p>



<p>Even though NerdBot's report was correct about Parker and Palmer's casting ahead of their reveal, you should still take its other picks with a grain of salt. That said, they're not outlandish or bad picks by any stretch, and in fact make a lot sense, which makes them even easier to believe. Still, it's not official, which is why this is still tagged as a just a rumor for now.</p>



<p>With the show reportedly set <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">to start filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, if that's still the case then we'll likely see official confirmations of more casting decisions soon. While none of these choices have been off the mark so far, the cast from both God of War (2018) and Ragnarok are all stellar performers. Hopefully, Alastair Duncan isn't the only cast member who gets to play their role in both.</p>

			<p>Independent publisher <strong>Dear Villagers</strong> and developer <strong>Sedleo</strong> have announced that the action/adventure game <strong>1348 Ex Voto</strong> will be released on <strong>March 12</strong>, though only for PC and PlayStation 5, as the Xbox Series S|X version has been canceled. This is far from shocking. Xbox Series console sales have been dwindling for several years now; for small studios, spending resources on the port might no longer be worth the cost. </p>



<p>Anyway, the game itself looks quite interesting. Developed by a team of around 15 Italian developers, it is set in 14th-century Italy, a period marked by political strife and the plague (which raged for a long time). The protagonist, <strong>Aeta</strong>, voiced by <strong>Alby Baldwin</strong>, is a young noble training to become a knight errant. However, her village is suddenly attacked by bandits, who also kidnap <strong>Bianca</strong> (voiced by award-winning actress <strong>Jennifer English</strong>, who played Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3 and Maelle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33), someone very dear to Aeta. Thus begins her dangerous journey across the Italian peninsula, with environments ranging from medieval villages and castles to the Appennino mountains and even the ruins of classical Rome, to rescue Bianca.</p>



<p>The creators from Sedleo drew inspiration from chivalric story tropes and spent extensive time in rural Italy recording environments to create an authentic, historically plausible world. The 'cinematic' combat system <strong>is inspired by HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts)</strong> and was animated with the help of trained performance-capture actors.</p>



<p>Aeta's martial knowledge will allow players to <strong>strategically choose between two combat stances</strong>: one-handed and two-handed weapons. Skill books have been scattered throughout the environments, and players who can find them will <strong>unlock new combos to personalize Aeta's swordplay</strong> with different weapon parts.</p>

<p>On PC, 1348 Ex Voto will be available for purchase via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895900/1348_Ex_Voto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/1348-ex-voto-251865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. The official system requirements haven't been revealed yet, but we know that the price will be <strong>$24.99</strong> on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
