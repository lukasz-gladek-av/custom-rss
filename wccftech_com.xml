			<p>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have released a brand new <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-the-masquerade-of-seattle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer diary</a> for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, where you can hear about Phyre's role as the Sheriff from Project Design Director, Level Designer, Environment Artist, and Game Designer. Each member breaks down the mechanics of the game and what role Phyre plays as a whole. Alongside the developer diary, The Chinese Room has released a Community Talks video, which talks about the work that the Environment Art team has done. You can find this video below, which goes into detail about the art of Seattle.</p>
<p><iframe title="TCR Community Talks 3: The Environment Art of our Seattle" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDC2TzniBu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest dev diary takes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-content-expansion-plans-to-be-announced-in-2025/">total up to 26</a>, which dives into detail about the city, the inhabitants found residing there, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNzggacI-EU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rules</a> that they have to follow. There are some main mechanics that are implemented by the Masquerade, which will be noticeable throughout your time in the game to keep you in check. To be able to continue through Bloodlines 2, you need to maintain the Masquerade. If you don't, you will die. However, to keep you in line with this fulfillment, there will be a Masquerade meter at the top of the screen, which will be color-coded so that you know how careful you have to be around Seattle.</p>
<p>Phyre's job as Sheriff means that they have to keep the peace, which includes snuffing out attempts to breach the Masquerade from the outside. This includes gangs causing trouble, assaults in the public eye, and more. To handle these situations, quick thinking is required, as well as the ability to be discreet and not draw attention to the ongoing situation.</p>
<p>It's a known fact that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 takes place in Seattle. To make it easier to navigate, the developers have split Seattle up into five districts: Uptown, Downtown, Chinatown, Financial, and Industrial. Each district offers something unique, including its own dangers that may not be found in other districts in the city.</p>
<p>There will be key locations that can be found in each district, from pawn shops and nightclubs in their respective districts. While some may be hoping for some pretty pictures taken in the Space Needle, Seattle has been designed to be darker and grungier than ever, a suitable spot for vampires to lurk in the shadows.</p>
<p>The next developer diary for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released on February 26, 2025. This diary will be diving into the cast of mortals, and the roles they play in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/exoborne-playtest-now-live-on-steam-ends-february-17/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Sharkmob and Level Infinite have announced that the tactical open-world extraction shooter Exoborne will have an open playtest, which will be available for players to dive into until 17 February. Unfortunately, this playtest is only available via Steam on PC, but the sign-up process for those who have access to it is incredibly easy to sign up, as you just have to visit the Steam page for Exoborne and press the "Request Access" button. This playtest is available worldwide. If you want to see what you can expect from your time in Exoborne, make sure to check out the new trailer below, which has been released specifically to celebrate the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne Playtest | Live Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXp6CC66gVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the trailer, Sharkmob has released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqnPjrA29k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 minute long video</a> that is a walkthrough of the gameplay, showcasing some of the main features that you can expect to experience in the game. This is the second title to be developed by Sharkmob, with the first being the short-lived Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt. Exoborne was first announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/exoborne-is-a-tactical-open-world-extraction-shooter-in-development-at-sharkmob/">two years ago</a>, and there have been minimal details about the game since.</p>
<p>This five-day global playtest will provide a lot of valuable feedback to the developers, as well as critiques and reports of any bugs that may be present during the playtest.</p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about Exoborne, this title is set to be an open-world, tactical extraction shooter that takes place in a ravaged world that was torn apart by extreme forces of nature. As a result, you need to customize and adapt your exo-rig to be able to gain an advantage over other players and to be able to sustain yourself during devastating weather changes.</p>
<p>Compared to other battle royales, Exoborne offers the opportunity to navigate a world with unprecedented verticality, which provides plenty of new opportunities for exploration, hiding spots, and advantages to gain against your opponents.</p>
<p>As you progress through the game, your progress will continue to unlock new gear and equipment that will benefit you in your future sessions.</p>
<p>While a fair amount of battle royales don't have a story, Exoborne has an ever-evolving story, which will help set the scene for any future content updates and mysteries that are uncovered in the world of Exoborne.</p>
<p>At the moment, Exoborne doesn't have a set release date, and the game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Will you be diving into the playtest for this new battle royale?</p>
