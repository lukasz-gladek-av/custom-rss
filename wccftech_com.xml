			<p>The Little Nightmares franchise has been a bit of a surprise hit, moving over 20 million units to date, so it’s <em>not </em>surprising that publisher Bandai Namco has opted to continue on with a third entry even though series creators Tarsier Studios has decided to move on. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares III</a> instead comes to us from the horror specialists at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Supermassive Games</a>, who have made a clear effort to recreate the look and feel of previous entries in the series. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Is Little Nightmares III a successful continuation of the franchise? Or is it time to wake from this recurring dream? Rub that sleep from your eyes and read on to find out...</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While the Little Nightmares series has always taken a wordless enigmatic approach to storytelling, the first two games offered more character development and hinted-at lore than you might expect. Supermassive at least partially resets the universe in Little Nightmares III, introducing two new mysterious protagonists, "Low" and "Alone," and some changes to the series' narrative structure that turns the "Little Nightmares" title into more of a literal statement. Overall, our new protagonists are likable enough, but some of the sense of intrigue and mystery that surrounded the first two Little Nightmares games is missing here.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In terms of gameplay, Supermassive doesn’t stray far from Tarsier’s blueprint. Little Nightmares III is a 2.5D platformer, with players having a relatively limited moveset, including the ability to jump, grab onto ledges and items, run, and crouch to sneak and fit through tight spaces. New to this game, each playable character now has a specific tool they carry with them at all times — Low has a bow that they can use to shoot things from afar, and Alone wields a wrench they can use to smash stuff and turn some cranks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For the most part, Supermassive have very accurately replicated the feel of past Little Nightmares games, for better and worse. Character movement is very deliberate, which isn't a bad thing in a horror game, but platforming in particular can feel very inconsistent and "canned." There are times when the game's fixed camera angles and perspectives make it very difficult to properly judge jumps, with certain trouble spots causing me to die dozens of times (and I’ve been playing difficult platformers since the '80s). Thankfully, Supermassive<em> has </em>addressed Little Nightmares II's excruciatingly bad combat. It's still not <em>great </em>here, but both Low and Alone having their own dedicated weapons greatly reduces frustration.</p>



<p>Speaking of our dual protagonists, the other big thing Supermassive has added to Little Nightmares III is online co-op. Little Nightmares II took a The-Last-of-Us-like approach, with players relying on an AI-controlled partner to get past some obstacles, and you can still play that way in Little Nightmares III, but you can also now team up with an actual human. Due to the new co-op focus, Supermassive have included some puzzles and challenges that require some slightly more involved teamwork. Nothing too crazy — this isn't a Hazelight game — but you will need some coordination when playing with another person, which can be fun.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, these moments aren’t as satisfying when playing solo. Players pick Low or Alone at the beginning of a singleplayer run, and there’s no ability to switch back and forth between them. During some of the more complex team tasks, you simply do your side of the challenge and the AI will automatically do their side. Strictly speaking, this works, but it almost feels like cheating as your AI partner flawlessly completes their half of a puzzle. When your AI companion isn’t being overly competent, they’re often the opposite, getting lost behind or failing to zero in and do a simple thing you need to proceed. The AI always came around in the end for me, but not before some moments of irritation and wasted time.</p>



<p>Supermassive could also have done more to make co-op accessible to more people. Little Nightmares III can only be played online with folks on your friends list; there is no couch co-op, and your ability to communicate with your partner is very limited. That said, Little Nightmares III does include a Hazelight-style Friend Pass, allowing you to play with an online pal even if they don't own a copy of the game, so kudos for that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Beyond the addition of co-op, Little Nightmares III feels very much like its predecessors, with its various sequences and set pieces sometimes feeling almost copy-pasted. Platform over rickety structures, crawl through various vents and tunnels, find skittery hiding nomes, tote around batteries to power devices, observe and sneak by various shambling monstrosities, run from those monstrosities in tense chase scenes, etc. If you’ve played past Little Nightmares games, you’ve done all this before. Little Nightmares III only summons up a couple of genuinely original sequences, which are saved for the game's final chapter. This finale hints at what Little Nightmares III <em>could </em>have been, but for most of the game's runtime, the game is merely fine. Arguably more fun and refined than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/little-nightmares-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often-frustrating Little Nightmares II</a>, but rarely surprising.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is also rarely all that scary. Earlier Little Nightmares titles were far from perfect, but they had a special <em>something</em>. The leathery Muppet-ey freaks that populated Tarsier's Little Nightmares games were uniquely off-putting, and while Supermassive tries their best to dream up their own atrocities, their creations don't quite measure up with many treading too close to generic creepy doll territory. Visually, Little Nightmares III also lacks some of the ambiance of the first two games, and even on PS5, it doesn't run quite as well as I'd like.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, despite the relatively negative tone of this review, Little Nightmares III does have its moments and can be fun with another human player. The game just doesn’t stand out in any particular way and with a relatively brief 4-hour runtime, this will likely be one of those dreams that fades from your mind not long after you wake up.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Little Nightmares III does a solid job of emulating the gameplay of earlier entries in the series, sometimes to a fault, but it doesn’t bring a whole lot else to the table and new developer Supermassive Games can’t quite pin down the eerie tone and creeping tension that made these games popular. While the ability to play online with others will appeal to some, it’s hard to escape the feeling that this series has officially gone from sleeper hit to just plain sleepy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Fantastic Pixel Castle Studio Head and Game Director Greg Street <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7382143103379587072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed via LinkedIn</a> that the company's debut game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-wow-designer-founds-new-netease-studio-making-an-aaa-fantasy-mmo-codenamed-ghost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fantasy MMORPG codenamed Ghost</a>, is in serious danger. That's because NetEase, which had provided the initial funding, has decided to pull the plug. Both NetEase and Fantastic Pixel Castle have been looking for another publisher, but with the current market conditions, it's a very challenging proposition.</p>



<p>That's why Greg Street admitted that team members are already being encouraged to 'explore future opportunities' (that means looking at new jobs):</p>



<p><em>If we're unable to find a publisher soon, the reality is that the studio would likely close, and the entire team, leadership included, would be affected. We want to thank the Ghost community, our playtesters, and the literally hundreds of people who have given us advice on how to find funding in this absurdly challenging time for our industry. I hope you all will have a chance to play Ghost. I also want to thank the FPC team who has made a game that we all should be proud of. I know it's cliche to say this, but demonstrably this is the best team I have ever worked with. </em></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We interviewed Greg Street</a> (previously, the Lead Systems Designer of World of Warcraft between 2008 and 2013) a couple of years ago, and the designer opened up on the upcoming MMO. The main twist of Ghost was supposed to be that players could hop between public 'Red' Shards, more akin to regular MMOs, and private 'Blue' Shards, which at first were supposed to offer survival elements but were then redesigned to support roguelike elements. </p>



<p>Fantastic Pixel Castle is not the only developer to suffer from NetEase pulling the plug; <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-entertainment-is-a-new-netease-studio-founded-by-bioware-bethesda-mmo-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it already happened with T-Minus Zero</a>, a studio formed by former BioWare and Bethesda veterans, as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other projects canceled earlier this year</a>.</p>
