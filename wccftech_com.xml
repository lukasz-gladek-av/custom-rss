			<p>There's no doubt that Fallout 76 <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-now-free-to-grab-on-prime-gaming-for-pc-and-xbox-franchise-sees-player-boost-following-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a major boost in its player base following the smashing success of Fallout's TV debut on Amazon Prime Video. While previous installments in the franchise also registered significant upticks in player activity, Fallout 76 is the only game still running and being updated, and it also received a few nifty cross-over items like the Ghoul's outfit, inspired by fan-favorite TV show character Cooper Howard (played by Walton Goggins). Now, on the heels of the Ghoul craze, the studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about to add playable Ghouls</a> for the first time in the franchise.</p>
<p>With all this excitement, no wonder, then, that it quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 20 million player milestone and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-reaches-21-million-players-asks-for-labor-of-love-nominations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> 21 million only a few months later. With the show's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second season</a> now in full production, the question is, can fans expect a bigger cross-over event?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-76-lead-producer-of-fallout-show-season-two-crossovers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to VG247</a>, Fallout 76 Lead Producer Bill LaCoste replied that that's probably not going to be the case, as the team doesn't want to go all-in on fan service with the risk of overdoing it.</p>
<p><i>I would imagine it would probably be along the same lines because we have an appreciation for the TV show, the story it’s trying to tell, and the characters it's trying to portray, and we also have an appreciation for the story Fallout 76 is trying to tell.</i></p>
<p><em>So, very, very limited amounts of crossover, where it actually makes sense because, again, we're on extreme ends of the Fallout timeline as well. So, some of that crossover doesn't make sense. We just want to make sure that it's done in a way that is supportive of the TV show, but also allows us to just coexist within this story overall that's being told.</em></p>
<p><em>We probably won't go out of our way to add a whole bunch of stuff specific to the show because we don't feel like we need to. We feel like it's great to let the TV show do its thing and for people to love the TV show for what it is, but also love our game for what it is, and not just give fan service for just the sake of doing it. We'll do some things that make sense, the Vault 33 suit made sense, it's something that exists in the world and you can have it, but yeah, we'll probably keep that relatively light would be my guess.</em></p>
<p>On paper, it sounds like the right choice. While fan service is generally appreciated by gamers, it can easily backfire. For now, though, the Fallout 76 community is very excited about the future following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths update</a> and the upcoming debut of playable Ghouls.</p>

			<p>Blizzard Entertainment is currently allowing those who are interested in playing Diablo 4 the opportunity to play it for free across all platforms on which you can get the game. At the moment, a large amount of ARPG fans are flocking to Path of Exile 2, with the game currently available in Early Access if you purchase it. Path of Exile and Diablo have been compared since the dawn of their very existence together, and Path of Exile 2 is no different. If you find that Path of Exile 2 isn't treating you quite right, or you want a new experience, Diablo 4 is currently available to play for free, thanks to Blizzard.</p>
<p>Once again, Blizzard has brought back the Diablo 4 trial, but with a significant difference. While the trial typically just involves the base campaign, this time, players will get the opportunity to try out the new Spiritborn class from the recent expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Vessel of Hatred</a>. Players won't be able to play the latest expansion, but you'll get to take the new class for a test run and see if it's something you enjoy.</p>
<p>The trial for Diablo 4 is currently available on PC via <a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/#purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle.net</a>, PlayStation, and Xbox. You'll be able to play the game for free until January 3, 2025. This gives you plenty of time to grind out the game, complete the campaign, and see if it's a game you'd be interested in playing in the future. Unfortunately, Diablo 4 isn't available as a free trial on Steam, so you won't be able to play it there if you are a PC user.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you find that you were enjoying your time during the Diablo 4 free trial, the game is on sale for up to 40% off across all platforms, which is the perfect time to get a game that will provide you with lots of value for money, especially with the addition of new content through the new seasons, as well as the ability to play the brand new expansion, Vessel of Hatred.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to purchase the game but want to play it, Diablo 4's base game is available through Game Pass on PC and Xbox, giving you the opportunity to try out the campaign for a significantly lower price than buying the game in its entirety. It does mean you won't have access to the expansion unless you purchase it, but that is a decision you can make later down the line.</p>
