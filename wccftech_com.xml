			<p>For those who have been waiting for a new installment in the Metroid Prime series since August 28, 2007, somehow, now that we're 20 days away (at the time of this writing) from the launch of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the waiting feels even more excruciating. At least in the lead-up to December 4, 2025, Nintendo is putting out new trailers to help tide players over in the last stretch of this long, almost two-decade wait.</p>



<p>The latest overview trailer is a significant look at gameplay, as it goes through several of the game's key systems, showcasing the main game mechanics players will interact with and utilize over the course of Samus' latest adventure.</p>



<p>It also features a solid look at the Galactic Federation soldiers who put out the distress call that Samus responds to at the start of the game, the same call that brings her to the planet Viewros. It seems like these allies will be with her for most of the game, which is definitely a shift from the classic Metroid style of Samus being the lone warrior adventuring out on her own.</p>

<p>Last week, at the one-month mark ahead of the game's launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-trailer-ups-the-ante-month-from-release/">a new action-packed trailer </a>showed off some stunning cinematic shots of the game. Now that Nintendo put out another trailer a week later, it feels like that might have been the start of a month-long marketing campaign that'll lead into the game's launch. If that's the case, it'll be great to regularly see more of the game as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Back in April, shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech got to preview the upcoming long-awaited release, with our Nathan Birch writing</a>, "<em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, Nathan's feeling that there's a game worth the wait on the way remains true when it arrives on December 4, 2025, on Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3m5l5wetmus2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> on the social network BlueSky by Gematsu, the GRAC (Game Rating and Administration Committee), the South Korean game rating board, has officially rated <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?c7b8077c36ff1119491eb25bd5560ffba6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?f0d05826089a46822d078e3eb6681337a6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is a Dead Man</a> today.</p>



<p>The first one is CAPCOM's new science fiction intellectual property. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in June 2020, ahead of the release of the new consoles (Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox SerieS and X), Pragmata was scheduled to launch in 2022, but it received several delays. Just when fans had nearly lost hope of ever playing it, the third-person action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced this June with a gameplay trailer</a> and the promise of a 2026 launch window. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to play the game</a> at Gamescom 2025, and CAPCOM later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed the fan speculation</a> that it was a 'secret Mega Man game'.</p>



<p>The GRAC rated the game for ages 12 and up with the following description:</p>



<ul>
<li>An action adventure game about the protagonist 'Hugh' and the android 'Diana' joining forces to defeat enemies and return to Earth.</li>



<li>Mild violence (battles hostile robot/AI forces using weapons).</li>
</ul>



<p>Romeo Is a Dead Man is also a sci-fi action/adventure game, although it is developed by Grasshoppers under the luminary guidance of Goichi Suda, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed at Gamescom 2025</a>. Those familiar with Suda51's games will know his games generally include mature themes, and indeed, the GRAC prohibited the game to minors with the following description:</p>



<ul>
<li>A sci-fi action adventure game in which the protagonist, Romeo Stargazer, becomes an FBI space-time special agent, Deadman, and chases down wanted criminals who travel across time and space due to time paradoxes.</li>



<li>Excessive violence (attacks using various weapons, frequent large amounts of blood, and various expressions of bodily harm.</li>



<li>Specific expressions of vulgar profanity and vulgar language (use of vulgar profanity and vulgar language such as “F<em>ck,” “Shit,” “F</em>ck,” “F*cker up,” and “Motherfucker”)</li>



<li>Excessive expressions that induce fear and disgust (creation of a terrifying and disgusting monster and atmosphere, expressions of blood and bodily harm that induce disgust).</li>
</ul>



<p>More than the ratings themselves, though, there's the fact that the GRAC usually rates games only when they are close to their scheduled launches. This year, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was rated</a> four months in advance of its debut, for instance, and the same happened to <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-version-gets-rated-by-south-korean-game-rating-and-administration-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good and Evil Anniversary Edition</a> in 2024.</p>



<p>In all likelihood, then, both Pragmata and Romeo Is a Dead Man are launching in the first half of 2026, and their definitive release dates could be announced very soon, possibly at the upcoming The Game Awards event. CAPCOM is gearing up for an explosive calendar year, between <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> (out on February 27, 2026), Pragmata, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gamescom-hands-on-preview-two-heavens-as-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, which is likely coming in the latter half of 2026.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.moddb.com/downloads/maxpayne2remixmod-by-darko913">A new Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod</a> introduces path tracing to a few early locations, offering stunning visuals. However, even on high-end GPUs like the RTX 5080, this lighting technology proves to be a true performance killer without proper optimization.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the modded version with path tracing and the vanilla version of the second entry in the series running side by side at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how some locations look stunning with path tracing. </p>



<p>At the same time, the comparison video clearly shows how path tracing is extremely taxing on current gaming hardware: with performance dropping from 1,255 FPS in the vanilla game to just 38 FPS in the mod in some instances, an RTX 5080 with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode takes a hit of over 1,200 FPS, representing an astonishing 97% performance drop overall. It's only with Frame Generation that the modded game reaches playable framerates above 60 FPS.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-path-tracing-requires-optimization-to-be-viable">Path Tracing Requires Optimization to Be Viable</h2>



<p>The massive performance hit seen in the Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod is far from being an uncommon occurrence, as almost every classic game that has received a path tracing overhaul sees similar performance drops. Among them is the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-rtx-remix-annihaltes-performance-4080/">original Max Payne</a>, which also sees performance drops in the 1000 FPS range on high-end GPUs, the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">Half-Life remake Black Mesa</a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">Left 4 Dead 2</a>. </p>



<p>This makes it even clearer how the demanding tech requires optimization work in conjunction with upscaling (and sometimes Frame Generation) to deliver acceptable performance, as demonstrated by some of the best implementations of the tech in recent years, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-continues-impressive-showcase/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rtx-remix-remasters-may-continue-to-be-the-best-option-to-update-classic-games-in-the-future">RTX Remix Remasters May Continue to Be The Best Option to Update Classic Games in the Future</h2>



<p>Although the current RTX Remix mods generally require very powerful hardware to run at playable framerates, these overhauls are likely to continue offering the best remaster option for games that won't receive official updates implementing the latest graphics tech. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Among these is&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto 4,</a>&nbsp;whose eventual remaster is unlikely to receive path tracing support,</span> based on<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"> the remasters released so far by Rockstar Games</a><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">.</span></p>



<p>Hopefully, gaming hardware will eventually catch up to make these unofficial remasters playable by the majority of players, even those without access to top-end hardware.</p>
