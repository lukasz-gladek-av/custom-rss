			<p>Starfield could be getting a highly requested feature in <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-bethesda-reiterates-exciting-things/">future patches</a>, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>As reported on the game's subreddit, plenty of evidence has been found in the code of the latest two updates which suggests that an <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-mod-interplanetary-engines-adds-in-system-travel-without-using-the-console/">interplanetary travel mechanic</a> that would allow players to travel between two different planets in the same system, which is a feature many have been asking for since the game's release, could be in the works. Sadly, seamless space to planet surface landing doesn't seem to be in the works, at least going by the game's current code, so we shouldn't expect the game by Bethesda to suddenly turn into Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky anytime soon, if ever.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although there's the chance that this feature will never make it into the game for any reason, the fact that a new big feature is seemingly in the works aligns with other rumors that have been circulating on Starfield these past few weeks. Reportedly, new quality-of-life improvements are coming to the game, alongside a second expansion, when the game will debut on PlayStation 5 during <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">Spring 2026</a>. The PlayStation 5 release was originally planned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">this year</a>, but a decision to delay this new version of the game to 2026 was made folliwing the low sales of the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space</a>.</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">I did enjoy Starfield</a>&nbsp;when it launched in 2023, my opinion of the game soured rather quickly as I returned to it before the launch of the Shattered Space expansion, which did little to alleviate the base game's most critical issues. Hopefully, the rumored new quality of life improvements and the new expansion will breathe new life into a game that has yet to achieve the full potential its solid foundation offers.</p>

			<p>Battlefield 6's unique destruction mechanics are not possible on a generic engine like Unreal Engine 5, but this is only one reason why the series will hardly leave the Frostbite Engine behind.</p>



<p>Speaking with Spanish publication <a href="https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/battlefield-2025/noticias/que-hacemos-no-posible-motor-generico-padres-battlefield-6-dicen-no-a-hacer-maletas-seguir-moda-industria">3DJuegos</a>, Senior Producer David Sirland commented on the possibility of the series ever switching to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine</a>, saying that the destruction mechanics seen in Battlefield 6 are not possible on a generic engine, as the Frostbite Engine is tailor-made for the new entry in the series and its features as much as the studio is tailoring the game itself for the engine. Achieving similar results on a generic game engine, pushing it to the limit, is achievable, Sirland added, but the developers are specialists with the engine, and he thinks this shows in the game. The Frostbite Engine being tailor-made for Battlefield 6 and the game itself being tailored for the engine isn't the only reason why the franchise is unlikely to leave its current engine behind, as the development studios are used to Frostbite and have engineers knowledgeable about the engine, which allows them to work in harmony, according to Producer Alexia Christofi, something that would likely require a lot of time to achieve with an engine switch.</p>



<p>Soon enough, players worldwide will be able to get a first, proper taste of Battlefield 6 ahead of its launch this October. The open beta, which is now available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">pre-load</a>, will allow players to test out the game this weekend from August 9 to August 10 and from August 14 to August 17. The open beta includes, for the first weekend, the Iberian Offense, Liberation Peak, and Siege of Cairo maps, and a selection of play modes, including Conquest, Breakthrough, Domination, and King of the Hill.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10. You can tide yourself over while waiting for the open beta to go live by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">first impressions</a> on the game.</p>

			<p>Genshin Impact will drop PlayStation 4 support due to hardware limitations and platform application size, developer HoYoverse confirmed today.</p>



<p>The game's PlayStation 4 support will be phased out gradually, starting with the game's removal from the PlayStation Store on September 10. All those who have already downloaded the game will be able to continue playing until April 8, 2026, when service will officially end. From February 25, however, the experience will be somewhat limited with the removal of all in-game purchases, but everything that's been purchased but not yet claimed can still be obtained until the end of service in early April.</p>



<p>As technical reasons are behind the termination of PlayStation 4 support, it's unsurprising that the system requirements for the PC and mobile versions have increased. Devices below the system requirements will still be able to run the game after the Song of the Welkin Moon update launches, but users playing on devices with specs lower than the minimum may experience performance and stability issues. Still, the <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408846">increased requirements</a> are not particularly high, especially the PC requirements, so most players should have no trouble playing the game even after the Song of the Welkin Moon.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
