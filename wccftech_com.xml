			<p>The implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler isn't perfect in all titles due to some games reportedly using an older version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>Commenting on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/df-star-wars-jedi-survivor-ps5-pro-severe-image-quality-problems-but-rt-in-performance-mode-is-nice.1038024/page-4#post-131783178"> ResetERA forums</a> in a thread discussing the disappointing Star Wars Jedi: Survivor PS5 Pro update, a developer going by the name of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/koralsky.22833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koralsky</a> commented on the poor image quality produced by PSSR in certain titles, revealing that the difference in image quality between different games is caused by the different versions of the upscaler used. In regard to the latest entry in the Respawn series, the developer confirmed the game is using SDK 9, being an Unreal Engine 4 game, so the team couldn't implement the latest up-to-date version of the upscaler that requires SDK 10 or higher, and has possibly used the very first version, hence the bad image quality.</p>
<p>While Koralsky couldn't provide more details on how many iterations of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler are already available and how each version improves on the previous, they could confirm that users should expect IQ improvements in the second and third batches of PS5 Pro-supported games using PSSR. In a game the developer is currently working on, for example, one of the later versions of PSSR, but not the latest, is giving much better results in comparison to TSR and FSR, and, as such, they expect the upscaler to get in a much better state in six, twelve months, compared to the state it is in the first batch of PS5 Pro supported titles.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro console is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the recently released mid-generation system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Typically, when a game experiences a rough launch or a development team decides to downsize, it isn't good news. While Starbreeze has downsized the Payday 3 team, it doesn't seem that there are planned layoffs, which, in the current climate of the game industry, is great news. When it comes to games that were highly anticipated and then flopping, Payday 3 is pretty high on the list. Even Starbreeze is aware of the fact that the game launched unsuccessfully. As a result, they've now downsized the team, as reported in <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starbreeze's interim report</a>.</p>
<p>In the report, CEO Mats Juhl states "in the coming months, investment will be lower as we round off 'Operation Medic Bag' for Payday and therefore enter Year 2 with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content." The report did not specify how downsizing the team will affect Payday exactly and whether it will affect the frequency of updates in Payday 3. This means that <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-still-requiring-online-connection-soon-alongside-nvidia-dlss-3-support/">the updates</a> will be smaller or less frequent. Despite the fact that the team has downsized and that Payday 3 didn't perform quite to their expectations, the report says that Starbreeze "remains financially strong," which is a good sign for a company in today's climate.</p>
<p>In the report, there was no mention of any layoffs, which is a pretty good sign. Hopefully this means that the staff have been relocated elsewhere within the company, or that they have already landed on their feet. While Payday 3 wasn't quite so successful, Juhl does mention that the recent DLCs that have been released for Payday 3 were well received, providing a glimmer of hope for Starbreeze. Although Payday 3's sales weren't up to scratch, the company's overall revenue has been cushioned nicely by the "relatively stable sales of Payday 2," a game that players found themselves returning to instead of playing Payday 3.</p>
<p>While the report predominantly focuses on the financial updates of the company, and how their current games are performing, there is also mention of Project Baxter, a dungeons &amp; Dragons project that "continues at full speed," with the report going on to state that there are internal playtests taking place, with a lot of "active discussions" happening with a lot of industry-leading companies.</p>
<p>While Starbreeze is known for making the iconic Payday franchise,&nbsp; they have also made games such as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. They've also started to dip their toes into publishing, with Dead by Daylight being one of the most well-known titles that they've published.</p>
