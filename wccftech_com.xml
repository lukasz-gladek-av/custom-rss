			<p>Yesterday, Kingdom Come Deliverance developer Warhorse Studios <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1918999047735857429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two important sales milestones for the franchise. To begin with, the sequel that launched around three months ago has sold over three million units to date. It had previously become <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a million seller in just a single day</a>, while the two million milestone <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was reached after two weeks</a>. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is definitely selling a lot faster than its predecessor, which only reached three million sales over two years after its debut.</p>
<p>It's not too surprising, anyway, given that it had established a strong fanbase with the original and it received excellent reviews, including a perfect score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech</a> by Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>Lots of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is still on the way, too, with three premium DLCs coming in Summer, Fall, and Winter.</p>
<p>But the original game is also still selling reasonably well. Last we heard, it had reached 8 million units sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just six months ago</a>, and it has now broken through the 10 million sales milestone. Of course, it's heavily discounted at this point, but it's still an impressive figure for a game that began as an indie title funded on Kickstarter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games president and largest shareholder Tim Sweeney discussed Unreal Engine 6 for the first time (alongside several other topics) in a massive interview featured in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Lex Friedman podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney said that the next big iteration of the Unreal Engine technology will unify the parallel development threads that Epic is currently working on. The goal is to get the first UE6 previews out to developers in two to three years.</p>
<p><em>We have these two different tendrils of progress. There's Unreal Engine 5 for game developers, and there's Unreal Engine 5 targeting the Fortnite community. And there's different bits of development that are only in one area that aren't applied to both. Not all the Unreal Engine 5 features are actually available in Fortnite, because some of them we haven't figured out or haven't gotten to the point where we can deploy them to all seven platforms in a platform-independent way. </em></p>
<p><em>The place where all of these different threads of development come together is Unreal Engine 6.&nbsp; </em><em>And it's a few years away. We don't have an exact timeframe, but we could be seeing preview versions of it perhaps two to three years from now. We're making continuous progress towards it.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Epic president admits that the technology is currently being hindered by the company's decision to stick with single-threaded simulations. That choice was made to simplify things not only for Epic itself but also for all game developers, but it is a limitation that Sweeney plans to overcome with Unreal Engine 6, which should finally fully embrace multithreading.</p>
<p><em>The biggest limitation that's built up over time is the single-threaded nature of game simulation on Unreal Engine. We run a single-threaded simulation. If you have a 16 core CPU, we're using one core for game simulation and running the rest of the complicated game logic because single-thread programming is orders of magnitude easier than multi-thread programming, and we didn't want to</em><br>
<em>burden either ourselves, our partners, or the community with the complications of multi-threading.</em></p>
<p><em>Over time, that becomes an increasing limitation, so we're really thinking about and working on the next generation of technology and that being Unreal Engine 6, that's the generation we're actually going to go and address a number of the core limitations that have been with us over the history of Unreal Engine and get those on a better foundation that the modern world deserves, given everything that's been learned in the field of computing in that timeframe.</em></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly the source of most, if not all, the CPU-related issues we've seen with Unreal Engine 4 and 5 games. It's great to hear Epic is finally going to address it, though it'll be a long while before we see Unreal Engine 6 in any game. As a reminder, the first UE5 preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-now-available-in-preview-updated-to-allow-for-even-bigger-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped in early 2022</a>, while the first games that took advantage of the new technology didn't appear on the market until mid-to-late 2023: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Layers of Fear remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remnant-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remnant II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-of-aveum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen</a>, to name a few. As such, we might have to wait until late 2028/2029 to play the initial batch of Unreal Engine 6 games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is Selling 2x As Fast as Any Other JRPG on Steam, Proving Square Enix Wrong]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong.1180659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's no mystery that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been a great success, given that developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it's already a million seller (despite being available on Game Pass, too). How does it compare to other JRPGs, though?</p>
<p>According to our analyst friend Rhys Elliott, who was often <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously featured in exclusive interviews on Wccftech</a>, it's selling much faster, at least on Steam. Elliott, who recently left MIDiA Research to become Head of Market Analysis at Alinea Analytics, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-more-than-twice-as-fast-as-other-jrpgs-on-pc-analyst-says-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the game's surprising early sales compared to triple-A games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a certified hit, officially selling more than one million copies. The announcement didn't say players reached – it said copies sold. That was a choice, and I applaud the transparency. It's worth noting that two of these are ports, but the data still speaks volumes for how much gamers are drawn to Expedition 33. The low price point likely also factored in, as our Steam data shows that many players bite the bullet when an AAA game goes on sale and drops below $50.</em></p>

<p>The same doesn't quite apply to PlayStation sales, where Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sold four times faster at launch. However, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is still ahead of the rest of the pack. Besides, losing to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PlayStation isn't surprising, given the enormous hype surrounding that game ahead of its launch last year.</p>

<p>In the interview mentioned above, Elliott also pointed to the fact that several JRPG fans were waiting for such a realistic JRPG, even with its turn-based combat, in contrast to Square Enix's public statements on the matter:</p>
<p><em>There was also an opening for a modern, realistic-looking JRPG. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has given RPG fans something they always wanted. If you asked Final Fantasy fans from the late '90s/early '00s what the ideal version of a JRPG should look like, it'd be something like this.</em></p>
<p>The reference is quite obvious. Back in June 2022, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that it is getting harder to mix turn-based combat and realistic graphics because they create a feeling of idiosyncrasy among some players. Indeed, that game focused strictly on action-based combat, shunning the series' traditional turn-based system.</p>
<p>While I personally don't fully disagree with Yoshida's assessment, there is definitely still space for turn-based combat, especially if it is revamped with key innovations such as in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which features real-time dodges and parries.</p>
<p>Besides, this particular game is just too good at almost everything it does, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's 9.5/10 review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>
