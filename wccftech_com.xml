			<p>First revealed at the start of the year during Xbox’s Developer Direct, Team Ninja and PlatinumGames have been working on a sequel to their HD trilogy of the long-running Ninja Gaiden series, with the first new title in more than a decade. While protagonist Ryu Hayabusa is still a driving force behind the narrative, this upcoming character action title focuses on a new hero: Yakumo, a Raven clan ninja and descendant of the Dark Dragon, who has been an antagonist of the Hayabusa clan throughout most of the series’ lifetime.</p>



<p>Not one to shy away from excessive amounts of blood and dismemberment, NINJA GAIDEN 4 is among the bloodiest action games I’ve played in a long time. Land a finishing blow on an enemy soldier, and their limbs will fly off, accompanied by a gratuitous shower of blood. While getting bathed in blood might be a core mechanic to the game, ala SUDA51’s recent roguelike Hotel Barcelona, it’s enough to make a squeamish ninja dog want to find the accessibility options and turn the blood splatter off. Yakumo can take advantage of the liquid potential to power up his Bloodraven form, a technique unique to him and a first for the series to take blood and utilize it as an attacking tool.</p>



<p>Yakumo is just as proficient in the art of the blade as series veteran Ryu Hayabusa and can bring a variety into combat, from the trusty katana to a thrusting spear and heavier hammer. Yakumo can don a pair of weapons at a time, with the second of the set being used for blood-based counterattacks and combo finishers. I gravitated towards the thrusting sword, something more akin to a war rapier than the type you’d find in fencing, that would transform into a massive drill in its bloodied form. While this wasn’t as effective against groups of enemies at a time, I still had access to the series staple Flying Swallow maneuver to dispatch enemies surrounding Yakumo, but just outside of melee range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside of boss fights, Yakumo is rarely caught in one-on-one situations, with enemy grunts preferring to group up on the solitary ninja from all angles. A soft target lock makes it easy to angle your attacks mid-combo from an enemy from one side to the next before launching them into the air and continuing your attacks in an aerial combo. Yakumo can also throw shuriken to preserve his combo momentum and temporarily stun enemies as he runs in for the approach. Swapping between weapon sets is just a button press away, and Yakumo can swap from his thrusting sword to a massive staff to twirl about and continue the onslaught, depending on the situation. Having this weapon transform into a massive rocket-powered hammer means it can be the best tool for breaking an enemy’s guard and armor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as the modern series is known for, Ninja Gaiden 4 is a masterclass in fast-paced ninja action and giving the player a multitude of tools to try and survive among the higher difficulty compared to other character action games. Yakumo can bring a limited number of healing items to battle, but he can just as easily recover a large chunk of lost health by way of his bloodraven form to absorb at least a portion of the health he’s lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cyberpunk setting is something new for Ninja Gaiden and a natural evolution from the nighttime cityscapes that the modern trilogy showcased. Industrial grey buildings bathed in a curtain of constant nighttime rain and darker flooring and accents leave the perfect backdrop for the fast-paced combat to pop and not get lost in blurring the two together. While I personally would like to see a return to some of the more rustic landscapes of the Hayabusa Village, I would not be disappointed if the entirety of Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place in these futuristic cities.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 both surprised and delighted me with a challenge that I’ve found to be sorely missing from character action games of recent years. Besting the single boss of the Tokyo Game Show demo on the hardest difficulty available made me appreciate playing a far more aggressive playstyle and how the game allows players to adapt their fighting style differently to each type of enemy or boss. This was my first time getting to see Ninja Gaiden 4 firsthand, and it has already proven itself to be one of my most anticipated action titles of 2025. </p>



<p>The wait to play Ninja Gaiden 4 is nearly over, as the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will launch across Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 21st</a> and will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass for the Ultimate tier.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a year since <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>, the relaunch of Amazon's MMORPG that introduced console versions with cross-play and a lot more. The developers were certainly hoping to get a big boost to the active player base, but that didn't quite happen.</p>



<p>However, that might change next week with the upcoming debut of Season 10, which is already garnering a lot of interest among MMO fans. Admittedly, it's not the most exciting time in the genre; sure, there's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-qa-homesteads-new-elite-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2 expansion Visions of Eternity</a> due later this month, and ZeniMax will release the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online, while Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has opened the Alpha test of World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>. But all those games are pretty old (if not very, very old) at this point. The only new MMORPG release of the year will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pax Dei's 1.0</a>, which, unfortunately, does not look like it will be ready for prime time when it comes to polish and features.</p>



<p>Compared to the aforementioned games, New World is undoubtedly much more recent, having launched in September 2021. Some of you will even remember that it was quite popular at first, with Jeff Bezos <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applauding Amazon Game Studios for its first successful release</a>. That did not last due to a severe lack of content, which led players (myself included) to leave in droves.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="New World:  Dev Update - October 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vvYpd_GKLI?start=183&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It took a long time, but the New World development team is slowly getting there, and the new season is very appealing. Nighthaven will introduce an eponymous new zone that, in a lengthy dev diary, was described as the game's largest and most vertical map, contrasting with previous additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-brimstone-sands-update-out-now-adds-a-new-zone-new-weapon-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brimstone Sands</a> (which was horizontal and barren). Visually, it is a love letter to classic horror with macabre, Eastern Europe-inspired aesthetics featuring towering castles, decrepit dungeons, and sweeping pine forests.</p>



<p>Not only does Nighthaven feature more points of interest, lore notes, and quests, it even adds some new interactive exploration and combat mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Chandeliers:</strong> Shoot them to drop on enemies (or risk them falling on you), reinforcing "look up."</li>



<li><strong>Throwables and Flammables:</strong> Use torches or fire staffs to burn spider webs and rat nests, expanding on systems from Cutlass Keys' lightning fields.</li>



<li><strong>Doors and Secrets: </strong>Various doors (bookcase, metal, wooden, magic-locked) lead to hidden areas.</li>



<li><strong>Arcana Tarot System: </strong>Collect 22 major Arcana cards (with Aeternum twists) to unlock tarot towers, elite chests, and caches. Combines with ancient glyphs for puzzles; encourages exploration via jump pads instead of guides.</li>



<li><strong>New Exploration Elements:</strong> Swim through mazes, dodge lasers, use water jets/elevators for vertical traversal.</li>



<li><strong>Jump Pads:</strong> Borrowed from the OPR (Outpost Rush) mode for open-world traversal in the region.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are many horror-inspired creatures, from vampires to werewolves, bats, gargoyles, and even Frankenstein-inspired constructs, and a new story to follow, of course. But the most exciting additions to New World, at least for the long term, are arguably those that seek to expand the endgame.</p>



<p>First and foremost, there will be a new 10-man raid titled Isle of Night. This will be the new toughest PvE challenge in the game, featuring many new enemy types and three boss fights, each with unique mechanics to encourage group coordination. Amazon Game Studios is also adding a Catacombs mode where players venture into a procedurally generated dungeon with a countdown. Through a Catacombs run, they will obtain various power-ups and rewards and have to decide whether to keep going forward or exit before time runs out to retain the rewards. </p>



<p>Progression is getting a big shake-up as well. Level cap is increasing to 70, and the Gear Score is being raised from 725 to 800. Additionally, any Gear with Gear Score of 700 and more will be upgradeable all the way with the new Umbral system.</p>



<p>But there's more: gear can now have up to four empty sockets called Perk Charms, which are roughly split into four categories (offensive, defensive, skill, gems), allowing for greater build customization. Plus, the new gear from PvP, Catacombs, and the Isle of Night raid will feature set bonuses for the first time, making it even more important to get all the pieces in a set.</p>

<p>You need only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1o02qyg/is_new_world_back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go to the MMORPG subreddit</a> to see that there are a lot of positive vibes among MMO fans about Nighthaven (which will go live on October 13 on PC and consoles) and New World as a whole. Could it be the start of a big comeback for Amazon's game? Hopefully, but even greater is the hope that the studio will have learned its lesson ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming The Lord of the Rings MMO they are making</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xai-will-release-a-%E2%80%98great%E2%80%99-full-scale-ai-generated-game-by-late-2026-says-musk.1318231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person according to Forbes, made a big claim yesterday when he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that the xAI Game Studio would release a 'great' full-scale AI generated videogame by the end of next year.</p>



<p>It was nearly a year ago when Musk, a known videogamer, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861801046949191686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that xAI, known mainly for the Grok generative AI chatbot, would 'make games great again':</p>



<p><em>Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. @xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!</em></p>



<p>Grok is considered to be one of the top chatbots, but making a full-fledged AI generated game (and a 'great' one at that) seems like a task far beyond the currently available technology to xAI and anyone else, for that matter.</p>



<p>It was just two years ago when NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research Bryan Catanzaro, who can be considered the father of the DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling technology, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>I do not believe that AI is gonna build games in a way where you just write a paragraph about making a cyberpunk game and then pop comes out something as good as Cyberpunk 2077. I do think that let's say DLSS 10 in the far future is going to be a completely neural rendering system that interfaces with a game engine in different ways, and because of that, it's going to be more immersive and more beautiful.</em></p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, there have been great advancements in the field of LLMs, but not nearly enough to create a great triple-A game yet, something I'm sure game developers are thankful for. That's not to say it will never happen, and AI will undoubtedly be used more and more in the gaming space, but to speed up and enhance the work of humans, not replace it outright. At least for the foreseeable future.</p>
