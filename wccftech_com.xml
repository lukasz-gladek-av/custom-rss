			<p>Ubisoft's President reportedly agreed to greenlight a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-enhanced-for-ps5-pro-runs-at-4k60-with-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> DLC, which would be funded by Savvy Games Group from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>The Streets of Baghdad May Expand to New Content as Ubisoft Reportedly Agrees on DLC Development for Assassin's Creed Mirage</h2>
<p>Ubisoft's new installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise might not be the only thing fans will be receiving this year, as the company is rumored to expand the previous one. After more than a year since its launch, we are hearing that the <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> is getting its first-ever DLC.</p>
<p>This might be a bit surprising since <em>Assassin's Creed Shadow</em>s is very close to its launch, and getting DLC for the Mirage edition is a report that nobody saw coming. The Shadows will be launching on 20th March 2025, which is roughly two months from now, and the supposed DLC for the Mirage Edition is also coming this year.</p>
<p>The report comes from the French publication Les Echos via prominent AC leaker '<a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">j0nathan</a>'. The report suggests that after the visit to Saudi Arabia, Ubisoft's president, Yves Guillemot,&nbsp;<span>agreed to the DLC development for&nbsp;<em>AC: Mirage</em>, which Ubisoft wasn't initially </span>interested in. Ubisoft has partnered with Savvy Games, which will be a major contributor to this project.</p>

<p>The game was initially designed to be a DLC itself and was supposed to continue the Valhalla storyline, but eventually made it to the game market as an individual installment. The game launched in October 2023 but hasn't got a single DLC since that time. Therefore, it's quite a surprise since the launch of Shadows is pretty close.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it is still a rumor, and we still need official confirmation from Ubisoft about this matter. However, considering Odyssey got its crossover three years after its release, which was after the launch of Valhalla, the Mirage DLC doesn't look unfeasible. Still, there are not enough reports to confirm the news, and we have yet to hear about its exact launch date. Until then, stay tuned.</p>
