			<p>Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent has increased its stake in FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa, edging closer to Sony's shares in the company.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-acquires-additional-shares-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a> today, Japanese publication Nikkei revealed that Tencent has increased its stake in the company by 1.11%, bringing it to 7.97%. The Chinese conglomerate confirmed the company had increased its share in FromSoftware's parent company as part of a <em>"capital business alliance"</em> between the two parties.</p>
<p>Despite increasing its share ratio, Tencent still isn't the largest shareholder in Kadokawa. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/">December</a>, Sony and Kadokawa confirmed that the two companies had entered a strategic capital and business alliance that made Sony the largest shareholder with around 10% of Kadokawa stock. The alliance will allow Kadokawa to realize the company's Global Media Mix strategy, which involves the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is only one of the game development studios owned by Kadokawa, but it is definitely the most popular. The creator of the Souls series is now working on an Elden Ring spin-off called Elden Ring: Nightreign which combines mechanics from the main game with roguelike elements to provide a co-op experience that has ton of potential, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Even though the experience wasn't perfect, the Closed Network Test&nbsp;succeeded in making me excited about the unique take on the Souls gameplay formula featured in Elden Ring Nightreign. I am now really looking forward to trying out the game when it launches in&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late May.</a> Hopefully, FromSoftware will be able to address some of the CNT version issues by then&nbsp;and fully realize the potential of the experience.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-last-30-40-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-last-30-40-hours-for-the-main-story-80-hours-including-side-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At a recent Assassin's Creed Shadows showcase event in Japan, Ubisoft Quebec Creative Director Jonathan Dumont discussed the estimated length of the upcoming open world game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1xnfk2J98Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Genki Gamer</a>, he said that the studio expects the main story to last at least thirty to forty hours, while the whole game could last more than eighty hours when accounting for all the side content.</p>
<p>That's certainly a hefty amount, although a bit less than the gargantuan Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which required 61 hours just for the main story and could last up to nearly 150 hours for a full completionist run, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/77729" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the website HowLongToBeat</a>. Admittedly, Valhalla's quests and missions weren't always memorable, and gamers nowadays have loudly expressed their disdain for fetch quests and the like. Hopefully, the new installment can deliver higher quality content on average.</p>
<p>For Ubisoft, it would be an understatement to say that there's a lot riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows. The French publisher had to deal with multiple underwhelming commercial launches, including Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, XDefiant, and Star Wars Outlaws, just to name a few. The shorter spin-off game Assassin's Creed Mirage did well enough, but now Ubisoft needs a big win. It's why they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows twice</a> in a desperate attempt to improve the game and make sure it hits the intended mark.</p>
<p>Bringing players to the long-requested setting of 16th-century Japan, toward the end of the Sengoku era, the game features dual protagonists Fujibayashi Naoe and Yasuke, a shinobi and a samurai, respectively. Ubisoft Quebec has previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-lets-you-stick-with-one-protagonist-for-most-of-the-game-exploration-loop-is-sherlock-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that players could stick with their preferred protagonist for most of the game if they so choose, though there will be some things that one is much better at than the other, and at some point, the game might force you to switch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shows-off-the-improved-anvil-engine-shares-new-tech-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new version of the Anvil engine</a> delivers interesting improvements to the stealth gameplay, too. For the first time in the franchise, hiding in the shadows will actually make the player character invisible to their enemies. This means that during nighttime, every shaded spot will become a dynamic hiding spot in which the players can advance themselves further, both indoors and outdoors. Players can even destroy lit lanterns with Shurikens, creating new shadowed spots. Moreover, the dynamic weather and seasons can affect stealth as well. When it's raining, the sound covers the player's footsteps. Rain also makes changes to enemy patrols, as some NPCs will seek shelter from the rain. Seasons have an even greater effect, as some bushes/vegetation won't be there in the winter months.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to debut on March 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1896969076884562078" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has surpassed six million players, adding that such a scope is 'hard to comprehend' but the studio is 'incredibly thankful' to the community.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't mean six million users have purchased the game. That's because STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been available on Game Pass from day one, making it difficult to discriminate between real buyers and subscription users who found the game bundled in their library.</p>
<p>Still, it sounds like GSC Game World is happy enough so far. Moreover, while there has been no mention of a PlayStation 5 version, the console exclusivity <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is believed to be timed</a>. Eventually, STALKER 2 should also launch on Sony's console, opening up to a whole new audience.</p>
<p>The developer still has a long road ahead when it comes to post-launch support, anyway. The game should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to include hardware-enhanced ray tracing, official mod tools with cross-platform mod integration, and even a multiplayer mode, about which we know practically nothing so far. On top of those, there are also two upcoming expansions that were sold as part of the Season Pass, included with the Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The base game is well worth playing, if a bit too rough, as I explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

			<p>Back in the late 90s, after releasing some amazing games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger, Squaresoft was the undisputed king of Japanese role-playing games. The publisher's dominance in the genre, however, did not stop other Japanese publishers known for releasing some absolute bangers in other genres from launching their own takes on the genre, like Konami, which released the first entry in the Suikoden series back in late 1995 in Japan. While the game directed by Yoshitaka Murayama wasn't particularly different from most traditional JRPGs, it set itself apart from the competition by tackling some pretty mature themes for the time, but the rise of polygonal 3D graphics, and a Western release date too close to that of Final Fantasy VII severely impacted the game's audience. No one at the time, however, could have predicted that the game would turn into a full-blown series, counting five main entries and a few spin-offs that would attract a loyal and enduring following, even after the series was clearly done.</p>
<p>While the series' creator Yoshitaka Murayama, who sadly passed away <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-series-creator-eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-scenario-writer-yoshitaka-murayama-has-passed-away/">last year</a>, moved on to create <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review-the-last-bow/">another franchise</a> that serves as a spiritual successor to the Konami series, Konami has finally decided to bring back the series after a very long hiatus and offer modern audiences a chance to play both the original Suikoden and Suikoden II on modern platforms with Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars, a remaster collection that does its job quite well, but whose real value lies in the quality of the original games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250221183259_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For those who have already played the two games, let's get one thing out of the way: Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars is a competent remaster that, maybe, could have done something more. Both games have received a considerable visual uplit, as every location has been faithfully recreated over the original games with higher resolution art and sprites, which have been left untouched over the original aside from receiving an obvious resolution bump, and new animated elements that help bring the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowstone to life like never before. Character portraits have been completely redone in Suikoden I to bring them to a similar level of quality as those featured in Suikoden II, which have received some light touch-ups but no major overhaul. The soundtrack of both games was left untouched, which is not a bad thing at all, considering how amazing they both are to this day, and the only proper improvement in the audio department is ambient noises, which add a little bit of color to the entire game and help immersion, especially in the many dramatic sequences where music is absent.</p>
<p>In addition to the visual uplift and the small audio improvements, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars features a few other enhancements, including a redone UI for both games, which is quite welcome, three difficulty options, and some other quality-of-life changes, including the ability to speed up battles, and a toggleable auto-battle option that allows players to either play multiple turns using the auto option or cancel it to input commands manually the following turn. While the difficulty options are welcome, and Hard difficulty can be a little challenging, especially at the beginning of the two games, where the player has limited resources and lacks access to the most powerful Stars of Destiny, the other two combat improvements leave something to be desired. Speeding up battles essentially speeds the entire game up, meaning that you will also have to listen to sped-up versions of the combat themes, which is so bad that I avoided using the option as much as I could, something that did not impact the experience too much since both Suikoden I and Suikoden II feature a snappy combat system that doesn't waste too much time playing out characters' actions. The new Auto Battle feature, on the other hand, is way more useful, but unfortunately, activating it forces a small black bar on the lower part of the screen that indicates Auto Battle is on, which is a little distracting and immersion-breaking. One final extremely welcome quality of life improvement exclusive to Suikoden II is the Turn Off EVen TImer option, which removes the time limit for certain events, such as Clive's sidequest.</p>
<p>The biggest improvement besides the improved visuals featured in Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars are the localization improvements. While the English localization was overall fine in the original game, though not stellar in any capacity, it was truly awful in Suikoden II, featuring some repeated dialogues, poor wording, and sentence structure that sometimes made it difficult to even understand what characters were saying. Both games have received a new English localization that flows much better in the first game, and that finally makes sense in the second game, making the story shine even more than it did back in the day, even with the horrible localization and all. Unfortunately, there are times when modern slang slips in that feels completely out of place, such as when Viktor calls Gremio a "drama queen" early in Suikoden I, but thankfully they aren't that frequent.</p>
<p>While the above is a solid selection of improvements, as I got reacquainted with the Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, I couldn't help but feel that something more could have been done, aside from fixing the music speeding up in battle when increasing combat speed. For starters, an option to speed up field traversal would have been welcome, as would a random encounter toggle. While the two games don't have a high random encounter rate, the way they handle fighting weak enemies, who can be Let Go at the start of any turn without any penalty, it just would have made sense to give players the option to turn encounters off completely to speed up the already excellent pace of both games. With so many playable characters available, any option to improve character management would also have been welcome, especially in Suikoden I.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303011312_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even though something more could have been done to improve the two games, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars is still a collection that every JRPG should be getting for a very simple reason: the high quality of both games. While the original Suikoden may feel a little too traditional, even with some of its unique quirks, Suikoden II is, simply put, one of the best Japanese role-playing games ever released, taking everything the original game did and bringing it up to eleven. In my opinion, it stands head-to-head with more popular JRPGs of the late 90s, like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VII, and Xenogears, and even surpasses them in some areas. It is a game that every fan of the genre should experience at least once.</p>
<p>At a glance, Suikoden I and its sequel don't look that different. Both are traditional top-down 2D JRPGs where players explore the Scarlet Moon Empire and the City-States of Jowston as the story dictates, alternating between towns and villages and dungeons as required. While both experiences are fairly linear, their traditional world maps sometimes allow players to branch out in search of new companions to recruit, the 108 of Destiny, who can join the main, mandatory story characters in battles, or provide significant help during Army Battles, which are played as some sort of rock-paper-scissor game in the first Suikoden and as a tactical turn-based RPG in the second, or new services at the Headquarters. The straightforward turn-based combat system is made more remarkable by the large parties of up to six members, the ability to use combinations attacks with certain characters called Unite Attacks, and its general fast speed. At some point during both games, certain characters will also be involved in duels, one-on-one fights that employ a rock-paper-scissor system and feature a sort of cinematic feel that looks great even with the dated and simple 3D backgrounds. Enriching both games are dungeons with a solid design featuring some puzzles, a decent wealth of mini-games that provide some variety, though the RNG dice game Chinchirorin remains as annoying as ever.</p>
<p>What truly makes Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars stand out even today with their relatively straightforward gameplay are their stories, which were, in many ways, groundbreaking for the time. Even with its relative simplicity, Suikoden I laid the thematic groundwork that would get further developed in its sequel, not shying away, as already mentioned, from dealing with some pretty dark and mature themes like the reality of war, often shown without any sort of filter, prejudice, and racism, duty, honor and sacrifice transcending every bond.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250302235643_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Suikoden II goes even deeper with these themes, featuring some chilling sequences that get etched into the player's memory and heart, all the while, much like its predecessor, balancing them out with considerably less dark sequences. What makes Suikoden II the best entry in the series and one of the best JRPGs of all time, elevating it past its already solid predecessor is its cast. The incredible main trio of protagonists - the main character, Nanami and Jowy -, the way their personal stories intertwine not only with the war between the City-States of Jowston and the Highland Kingdom but also with the overarching series' story of the 27 True Runes and the personal conflicts of other story-significant characters are a massive highlight of the experience, and how they get resolved, no matter the ending reached, are capable of moving pretty much anyone who has the chance of experiencing them first hand. All of this is massively improved by the incredible and diverse soundtrack, whose standout piece, the beautifully melancholic Reminiscence, is only the tip of the audio iceberg.</p>
<p>But if there is one character that is the true standout of the Suikoden II cast is one of the main villains, the infamous Mad Prince of the Highland Kingdom, Luca Blight. This psychopath, who can only be described as a demon in human skin, is rightly considered one of the best villains ever seen in JRPG, and for good reason, surpassing other known JRPG madmen like Kefka and Sephiroth by engaging in the most heinous of war crimes only because he had the authority and the power to do so, all while delivering some unforgettable speeches that truly send shivers down the spine. Going against the tendency of the time, which still holds true today, to make JRPG villains grey, the absolute evil that Luca Blight shows whenever he appears on screen, and even offscreen at times, is a refreshing breath of air nowadays, a testament of the genius and courage of Yoshitaka Murayama and the entire writing team.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars definitely succeeds at updating the two classic JRPGs while staying faithful to the original games' art direction, although a few more options and quality-of-life features wouldn't have hurt. Even if the remaster somehow failed to deliver a quality updgrade, however, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars would have been a worthy purchase for any JRPG. The two classic games have stood the test of time incredibly well and still provide extremely compelling gameplay enriched by charming casts and thought-provoking stories that are still worthy of experiencing in 2025 as they were back in the late 90s.</p>
