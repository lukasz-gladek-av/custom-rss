			<p>A new extremely handy Steam Deck mod is now available for download, allowing users to use AMD FSR 3 Frame Generations in games that support NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation for significantly improved performance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decky Framegen Plugin</a> is a Steam Deck plugin that replaces the NVIDIA DLSS DLL with the FSR 3.1 DLL, allowing users to use Frame Generation in Steam Deck in games that do not natively support AMD's tech, such as Black Myth Wukong, Final Fantasy XVI, Hogwarts Legacy and The Witcher 3, as showcased in a very informative video put together by Deck Wizard which also provides detailed installation instructions. While the end results aren't always perfect, as there are some visual issues such as ghosting in Final Fantasy XVI, for example, the mod definitely helps make more games playable with acceptable performance on Steam Deck, although games running below 30 FPS won't benefit too much from it due to the input lag caused by the low base framerate.</p>

<p>Since its release back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, the Steam Deck has become an incredibly popular gaming system, essentially bringing forth the age of handheld PCs that doesn't seem will end anytime soon. Following the launch of the original model, Valve released a slightly upgraded model featuring a gorgeous <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-679-usd-an-all-white-exterior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OLED screen</a> and a few other improvements, but the company doesn't seem interested in doing <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-wont-be-doing-yearly-steam-deck-releases/">yearly releases</a>, despite the demand. Earlier this month, it was rumored that a new version of the system powered by the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-amd-ryzen-2-not-works/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APU</a> was in the works, but Valve quickly squashed the rumors, so it will definitely be a while until we will be able to get a proper Steam Deck 2 in our hands.</p>

			<p>A new year means another entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry’s flagship wrestling franchise</a>, and today 2K Games unveiled WWE 2K25. After a few years of relatively conservative updates, it seems like developer Visual Concepts is going all out with WWE 2K25, which adds a new island hub you can explore with up to 50 other players, a Bloodline-focused 2K Showcase mode, and a roster of over 300 Superstars, with no restrictions on who can fight who – yes, intergender wrestling is in. You can check out the first teaser trailer for WWE 2K25, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The OTC | WWE 2K25 Official Announce Trailer | 2K #WWE2K25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07_F68J-H9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s a look at the game’s covers and some early screenshots…</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 most standout new feature will likely be The Island, an online hub similar to ones seen in NBA 2K for years, in which you can interact with other players and complete various challenges. Interestingly, The Island will feature its own storyline, in which you vie to impress Roman Reigns that's completely separate from the usual MyRise story mode (which is still in the game). The Island will be exclusive for the current-gen Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions of the game (it seems PC players will have to sit the feature out).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Bloodline Rules Showcase will open things up somewhat, offering three different types of matches – ones that let you relive history, ones that let you change history, and dream matches that never got to occur in real life. Want to know how a historic Bloodline member like Yokozuna might match up against the current roster? Now you can.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of some other new features coming in WWE 2K25…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Match Types and Gameplay Improvements:</strong> Intergender wrestling makes its long- awaited debut in the WWE 2K franchise! WWE or player-created Superstars from the men’s and women’s divisions can now compete against each other to set up limitless matchups across all game modes. Additional features include the return of Chain Wrestling, Bloodline Rules Match, Underground Match, and new barricade diving! More details on each new match type will be shared soon.</li>
<li><strong>MyGM Online Multiplayer:</strong> Intrepid GMs can take their show on the road and challenge general managers worldwide in the enhanced MyGM for WWE 2K25, now with online multiplayer for up to four players. Players draft WWE Superstars and Legends to their weekly show’s roster and lead their brand through multiple-week seasons with a bigger selection of General Managers, cross- brand Premium Live Events, and more.</li>
<li><strong>MyRise:</strong> Players guide their Superstar from the women’s or men’s division in a singular, multi-gender MyRise storyline where Bayley, Kevin Owens, and other Superstars infiltrate NXT in an attempt to take control of the entire WWE. Featuring new personality choices that lead to specific storylines, as well as brawl environments, unlockable arenas, characters, useable objects, and more, plus new ally storylines involving Jey Uso, Bianca Belair, Seth Rollins, and other Superstars.</li>
<li><strong>Universe:</strong> WWE 2Ks sandbox mode receives upgrades to give players greater control over their Universe experience, including the long-awaited return of Promos! The new system includes multiple promo types and outcomes with new cutscenes and branching choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feels like WWE 2K25 is looking to mix up the formula a bit -- following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautious but steady improvement</a> over the past few years, we'll see if the gambit pays off. As usual, WWE 2K25 will come in an array of different editions, including the basic standard edition for $70 on both current and last-gen consoles, the $100 Deadman Edition, and the $130 Bloodline Edition. Everyone who pre-orders any edition gets the Wyatt Sicks Pack, which includes characters Uncle Howdy, Dexter Lumis, Nikki Cross, Joe Gacy, and Erick Rowan. Meanwhile, here’s what’s included in the Deadman and Bloodline Editions of the game…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadman Edition</strong> – “Deadman Edition Bonus Pack” which includes Mattel Elite “Greatest Hits” Undertaker and Original Undertaker (‘90) Persona Cards and playable Superstars, a useable Urn object, Undertaker ‘95 Mask cosmetic item for The Island, and Brother Love Manager, plus a Season Pass to all five post-launch DLC character packs and 15,000 VC.</li>
<li><strong>The Bloodline Edition</strong> - All bonus content included in the Deadman Edition, the Ringside Pass (Season Pass plus Superstar Mega-Boost), The Rock Nation of Domination Pack, which features a Rock Nation of Domination Persona card and playable Superstar, plus The Bloodline Edition Bonus Pack, which features Mattel Elite Series 114 Jey Uso and Mattel Elite “Greatest Hits” Roman Reigns Persona cards and playable Superstars. Also Family Above All Hoodie, OTC Shirt, Yeet tank Top and Yeet Sunglasses cosmetic items for The Island, while for Steam only, it includes an additional 32,500 VC. Also included is the WrestleMania 41 Pack which features the WrestleMania 41 Arena, two WrestleMania 41 Main Event Superstars Persona cards and playable Superstars, and a new Superstar Persona Card (TBA), which will all be available Summer 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>WWE 2K25 hits PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on March 14, although those who drop the cash for the Deadman or Bloodline Editions can play a week early on March 7. Look forward to a Wccftech preview and review of WWE 2K25 over the coming weeks.</p>
