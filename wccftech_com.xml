<h2>Revenge of the Savage Planet - May (PlayStation, Xbox, PC)</h2>
<p>Journey to the Savage Planet was well-received, and Revenge of the Savage Planet is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/raccoon-logic-showcases-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-featuring-co-op-modes-new-pois-several-additions/">sequel to that title</a>, bringing you back into the fun, satirical sci-fi world. You'll get to traverse alien worlds while getting gear upgrades and uncovering secrets of the worlds that you traverse. Even the trailer itself is dripping in satire and comedy. You're bound to be in for a good time with this one.</p>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3 - June (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2>
<p>When it comes to horror franchises, Little Nightmares is beloved by many. While it isn't particularly full of jumpscares, there are small details that make the game intense and horrifying. The third installment in the franchise is set to release in June, and this will be the first time that the franchise will have the option for full co-op throughout the game. Previously, the games were single-player, despite often telling a tale of two characters throughout the game. Make sure to put this one on your wishlist.</p>

<h2>MainFrames - March 6 (Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2>
<p>If you've been wanting to get that hit of nostalgia that comes from old PCs from the 90s, then this is a game you'll want to check out. It's an adorable little platformer set to release on March 6, where you play as a Floppy Disk and explore the ins and outs of a PC, taking you on a variety of journeys through mini-games and puzzles. It's set to be a cozy platformer, so stay tuned for the release of this one.</p>

<h2>A Webbing Journey - TBA</h2>
<p>Be warned, as this one isn't for the arachnophobes out there. However, if you've found yourself wanting to become a spider and swing around the house while building webbed structures, this is the game for you. It combines platforming, physics, and wholesome sandbox goodness. While it doesn't have a release date just yet, the game is already out on iOS and Android.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee - TBA</h2>
<p>While you could just play the original version of Yooka-Laylee as that still stands up as a fantastic game, Yooka-Replaylee will be an enhanced version of the loved platformer, adding in new challenges and content to play with, as well as new secrets to uncover. If you are a fan of Spyro the Dragon or Crash Bandicoot, you'll definitely want to check out Yooka-Replaylee.</p>

<h2>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - February 14 (PlayStation, PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox)</h2>
