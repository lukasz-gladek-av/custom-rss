			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director recently apologized for the difficult Platinum Trophy of the game, vowing to never make another so difficult in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-34152657">Daily Star</a>, director Naoki Hamaguchi discussed the difficult Platinum Trophy, which requires multiple playthroughs of the game and completing mini-games at hard difficulty. He apologized for how difficult it is to unlock and assured that he would never make one so difficult to obtain again, so trophy hunters should have far fewer problems mastering the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project.</p>
<p>To Daily Star, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi also <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-wont-34152228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> how the game won't be getting any DLC to have the sequel out as soon as possible and how the third entry in the series is likely to shake up the formula of the second game in the Remake trilogy, as he wants to add a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/">different twist for a new and exciting experience</a>. This new experience will likely involve the Highwind airship, as the team is fully committed to delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">freely explorable map using the airship.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5, and it is played best on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> until the game finally hits PC on a yet-to-be-confirmed date. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Today, GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859930792564285907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>via social media that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already sold one million copies, and 'many more' have joined the Zone via Game Pass. It's not entirely unsurprising given the massive amount of hype (and Steam wishlists) the game had garnered over the years.</p>
<p>It's probably not nearly enough to recoup the development costs, though. GSC Game World told me during <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 chat</a> that the studio was massive, with over 430 employees working on STALKER 2. The social media blast also claimed this was only the beginning, and indeed, on launch day, GSC Game World wrote an open letter to fans acknowledging the game's rough edges outlined in reviews.</p>
<p><em>There are so many things in the game that we are incredibly proud of. Nevertheless, STALKER 2 is a massive game. We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven't released anything of this scale before. We're absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention. In the first days after release, we'll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can. Then, we'll switch to larger updates that include constant improvements. There will also be free in-game content â€” we'll share its roadmap later in December. We have big plans for the STALKER universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.</em></p>
<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> that features like hardware ray tracing, mod tools to make cross-platform mods and even multiplayer modes will be released after launch. The Ultimate Edition of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl also includes access to the Season Pass, which is already guaranteed to add at least two expansions to the game at some point in the future.</p>

			<p>A new Silent Hill 2 patch is now live on PC and PlayStation 5, addressing some PS5 Pro-specific issues and much more.</p>
<p>The 1.06 patch focuses on fixing various issues on both platforms, including the widely reported visual glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro. Other PlayStation 5-specific fixes include audio, map and blocker fixes, boss animations, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch also addresses many issues on PC, including the interference between saving a game and properly performing vibrations on the controllers, improved mouse sensibility and mouse input, and more. The full patch notes are available on Konami's <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/eu/en/update_106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>
<p>Despite some issues here and there, developer Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking Silent Hill 2, developing their best game to date. You can learn more about it by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more.1042704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Blizzard Entertainment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRgtN1sMf6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted</a> a Campfire Chat with Diablo IV developers to discuss the upcoming 2.1 patch that will go live on the Public Test Realm between December 3 and 10, exclusively on PC's Battle.net.</p>
<p>The team talked about the main features and new content that will be in the new update, starting with the long-awaited Armory feature, which allows players to save and switch between different builds easily without any respeccing costs. With the Armory, Blizzard seeks to improve player flexibility in the endgame content. They noted that controller support for the feature would not be available right away, though. Worries about accidentally selling items saved in the Armory were put to rest, too, with the developers assuring players that saved items will be favorited automatically to prevent any accidental sales. They will also have an icon indicating they are part of a saved build.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other highlight of Diablo IV Patch 2.1 is the new system based on Witchcraft powers. Players will engage with witches around the Tree of Whispers, offering a new currency called Restless Rot (earned after defeating the new Headrotten enemies) at altars to learn new witchcraft abilities through a streamlined menu system. The season also introduces a reputation system called Covens Favor for unlocking rewards, including new witchcraft powers. Additionally, players can discover lost powers by finding Forgotten Altars in the world. Over 20 powers will be available, with popular options like the poison frog summon, Doom orb, and vengeful servant. Another Witchcraft Power called Pano sucks enemies into a swirling vortex of destruction.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players will find Headrotten enemies through the new seasonal activity called Headhunts, earning the new Occult Gems as rewards. These gems are special socketables that boost defense and provide unique effects to fine-tune player builds. The developers showcased examples of occult gems like Elder Sigil, Killing Wind, and Dust Stone, each offering different bonuses based on player preferences and playstyle. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements have been made to the town around the Tree of Whispers, adding more services and streamlining navigation to enhance the player experience during Headhunts. Of course, Diablo IV Patch 2.1 will also come with a plethora of class changes and overhauls. The full patch notes will be released on Wednesday, November 27.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-was-at-some-point-a-roguelike-game-with-arkham-like-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented </a>with making this game a roguelike with Arkham-like combat early in development?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Path of Exile 2 Will Not Leave Adventurers Disappointed, Even During Early Access]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-will-not-leave-adventurers-disappointed-even-during-early-access.1042686/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a very long wait and a last-minute <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-date-gets-pushed-back-by-three-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a>, Grinding Gear Games' Path of Exile 2 is finally launching in two weeks in Early Access. However, it will be an early access game only in name, as it will boast a massive amount of content and even some endgame activities that will make the wait for the full version of the game easier to bear.</p>
<p>While I was not able to try out the game once again following the opportunity I had during <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-date-gets-pushed-back-by-three-weeks/">Gamescom 2024</a>, which left me thoroughly impressed, Grinding Gear Games made it abundantly clear during yesterday's presentation that Path of Exile 2 will even exceed my expectations, offering a staggering amount of content to sink my teeth into right from its initial release on December 6th. The Early Access version will include the first three of the six story campaign acts, which will take players up to level 25, as well as Cruel Mode. This mode, which will be removed once version 1.0 is out with the other three acts, will allow players to experience the first three acts at a higher difficulty that will take them to level 65 to be ready for the endgame content.</p>
<p>Having endgame content straight from the beginning became a focus during the development of Path of Exile 2, as the studio realized that one of the biggest issues for an action RPG at launch was not having enough. As such, after spending 25 hours completing the campaign the first time and clearing it again in Cruel Mode, players will be able to spend a lot of time clearing the random encounters spread across the Atlas, a huge overworld map filled with different areas completely separate from those seen in the campaign. The endgame content will be further expanded by systems not available during the campaign, such as Breaches, a mechanic returning from the first entry in the series, where players will have to defeat enemies as quickly as possible, and Rituals, where players will have to survive multiple waves of enemies in quick succession.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Endgame Content Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpIbaTXJD4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 will not skimp with character classes right from the get-go as well, offering players six different classes - Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Mercenary, Witch, and Sorceress - all coming with very different play styles, ranging from short-range to long-range and magical warfare. This already massive variety of combat styles will be further expanded down the line with six more classes that will bring the total number of classes to twelve. Even with just six classes, Path of Exile 2 will have a lot to offer to players who want to create unique builds, thanks to the extremely versatile customization systems in place that don't tie skills to specific classes.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 will be free to play once its 1.0 version launches, but those who wish to dive in straight away in the Early Access version will need to purchase one of the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase">Early Access Supporter Packs</a>. The basic pack will cost $30 on PC and consoles and will only grant access to the game, while the more pricey packs will include some additional in-game and physical goodies, although the physical goodies are only available for the PC versions of the Thaumaturge of the Vaal, Warlord of the Karui and Liberator of the Wraeclast Supporter Packs.

<p>From what I have experienced and what the developers Grinding Gear Games have shown so far, Path of Exile 2 has the chance of becoming one of the best action RPGs ever released, if not the very best, taking everything that made the original great and competently modernizing it while expanding the experience in so many ways that it wouldn't be surprising to see players spend hundreds of hours in the game and still not having seen the full potential of the systems and mechanics powering the game. As such, I really cannot wait for the Early Access version to release and be able to spend more time with a game that I feel I will be playing for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>If you've been waiting to hear the system requirements for the PC version of Path of Exile 2, they are below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>OS: Windows 10</em></li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-won%E2%80%99t-finance-any-more-film-adaptations.1042644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year in style. The IP is healthier than ever, and Wizards of the Coast has just released the new 2024 Player's Guide and Dungeon Master's Guide, while the Monster Manual is slated to be available on February 18, 2025. But the company is betting big on videogames, too, following the big success of Larian's Baldur's Gate 3, which earned the D&amp;D IP owner over $90 million in its first six months.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks confirmed that there's another videogame in development in addition to the ones we already knew of. Let's recap: the co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by Starbreeze in December 2023 for a 2026 release; this one will be set in Waterdeep, one of the biggest cities of FaerÃ»n. Then there is the D&amp;D Virtual Reality game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-virtual-reality-game-announced-by-demeo-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this January by Resolution Games, and the regular Dungeons and Dragons Unreal Engine 5 game in development at <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invoke</a> (formerly Tuque, the studio that made Dark Alliance). This latter Dungeons &amp; Dragons videogame might feature some sort of PvP mode, as gleaned from a job advertisement.</p>
<p>It's not even all about D&amp;D, anyway, as Hasbro has also invested in Archetype Entertainment's sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>, featuring Matthew McConaughey as one of the main characters and developed by former BioWare designers and writers. Moreover, they've got a G.I. Joe Snake Eyes game in development at Atomic Arcade and a horror game in the making at <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-opens-austin-studio-for-aaa-game-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skeleton Key</a>. The article also said there's a new Magic title in testing with the Commander format; this would be separate from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/magic-the-gathering-arena-something-magical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic: The Gathering Arena</a>. All in all, the company is investing over a billion dollars at a rate of $100 to $150 million a year to release one or two games per year starting in 2026.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Hasbro is paring back its investments in film adaptations. Following the slightly underwhelming box-office performance of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and Transformers One, it won't co-finance any new movies or TV series. On the subject, Cocks said:</p>
<p><em>We want to reach fans where they want to play, and increasingly that is through digital expressions of their favorite brands.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dantes-ring-is-a-so-called-anti-combat-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-the-invincible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's 42nd Golden Joystick Awards, which saw Black Myth: Wukong <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triumph</a> in the Game of the Year category, developer Starward Industries unveiled a new game called Dante's Ring. The Polish studio's first game, as you might recall, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-invincible-exploring-the-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Invincible</a>, an adventure game adaptation of StanisÅ‚aw Lem's sci-fi novel.</p>
<p>This time, the setting appears to be entirely original. Interestingly, Dante's Ring is being labeled an 'anti-combat' action RPG. What that means in practice is you'll be roaming a volcanic range with the goal of fighting against the environment, surviving, and possibly rescuing other folks. There's also going to be an element of choice, apparently, in how you navigate the various survivor factions featured in Dante's Ring. Here's the official overview:</p>
<p><em>The game focuses on rescue and survival, using retro equipment in a race against natureâ€™s wrath among mystical beliefs. Will you fight a frenetic fire or flee from a pyroclastic flow? Break the door to rescue someone or stop and give first aid? Once the volcanoâ€™s hot breath reaches you, every second counts.</em></p>
<p><em>Dante's Ring offers a fresh approach to gameplay, focusing on avoiding combat and immersing you in a mesmerizing, eerie world where you pass through the gates of hell to save just one more life from its grasp.</em></p>
