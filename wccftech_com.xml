			<p>Today, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II developer/publisher combo Warhorse Studios and PLAION have unveiled the post-launch roadmap for the upcoming first-person roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-release-date-bumped-forward-by-a-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set for February 4</a>, is just the beginning of the players' new journey with Henry of Skalitz. Throughout 2025, the developers plan to constantly release updates that include various improvements and additions.</p>
<p>The roadmap kicks off this Spring with the introduction of several free enhancements, such as a Barbers feature to customize your looks, a Hardcore Mode for those seeking a harsher challenge, and Horse Racing, where you can hone your mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises.</p>
<p>In the Summer, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will receive its first premium DLC, called Brushes with Death. In this new quest, Henry must aid an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past. He'll have to face perilous encounters to unravel a web of dangerous plots.</p>

<p>In the Fall season, the Legacy of the Forge DLC will dig into Henry's roots by exploring the legacy of Martin, his adoptive father. Henry will work to restore a once-famous forge and test his blacksmithing skills while uncovering forgotten stories from the past.</p>
<p>In the Winter season, the third and final premium DLC, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released. Players must enter Sedlec Monastery, where intrigue is said to run deep. Henry is tasked with a secret mission and must navigate the complex dynamics of the area, uncovering hidden truths and navigating a maze of conflicting interests.</p>

<p>The three premium DLCs are included for those who purchase the more expensive versions of the game: either Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition (which is priced $20 higher than the Standard Edition and comes with the Season Pass, the Shields of Seasons Passing that lets players customize their shields with one of four unique designs, and the full costume Gallant Huntsman’s Kit), or the Collector's Edition that adds the following physical goods for a price of $199:</p>
<ul>
<li>a statue of Henry and his trusty steed, Pebbles</li>
<li>the exclusive cloth map Alleys of Kuttenberg</li>
<li>the enamel pin set Coats of Valor</li>
<li>the iconic Letter of Hope - which Sir Hans Capon was entrusted with</li>
<li>and the King’s Rebels collectible cards set</li>

			<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Shooter Games of 2024 list</a>, we wrote that the genre had bested 2023's output thanks to new releases like Helldivers 2, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Marvel Rivals. Well, now that we look ahead at what's coming in 2025, we can already tell this one's going to be even better - and it might even dwarf prior years if certain <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored launches</a> actually happen. That said, we'll stick to what's been confirmed by publishers to be scheduled for this year. It's already a great-looking list, anyway.</p>

<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sniper-elite-resistance.jpg"></a></h2>
<h2>Sniper Elite: Resistance (January 30)</h2>
<p>The year for shooter games begins with the return of Rebellion's Sniper Elite tactical shooter franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sniper-elite-resistance-gets-january-30-2025-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is out in less than ten days</a>. This time, players will find Harry Hawker, who was available for selection in the cooperative modes of the three previous installments, as the lead character. An agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) division, Hawker discovers the existence of a new wonder weapon, reportedly so powerful that it would practically guarantee the Nazis' victory in the war. He'll have to work with the French Resistance in 1944 Vichy France (the events running in parallel to those seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-5-jager-beware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sniper Elite 5</a>) to locate and destroy the weapon before it can ever be used.</p>
<p>Sniper Elite: Resistance is adding a new Propaganda Mode that is unlocked by discovering hidden Propaganda posters. In this mode, you get to play as a Resistance fighter in quick-fire challenges against the clock. The campaign is also fully playable in co-op, and the fan-favorite, Souls-like inspired <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/sniper-elite-5-how-axis-invasion-works-and-how-to-kill-your-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axis Invasion</a> returns as well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/245e7a61-0c9b-45f7-9dd2-481187b3641e.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>DOOM: The Dark Ages (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>Following the successful releases of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016's DOOM</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020's DOOM Eternal</a>, it's no wonder that The Dark Ages may be topping the personal most anticipated shooter games chart of many genre fans. id Software has successfully recaptured and reimagined what made the franchise great in the first place, and we can't wait to see how this new evolution plays out.</p>
<p>For now, all we know is that this is effectively a prequel that will show how the legend of the DOOM Slayer started. The developers have described it as a 'cinematic origin story' where the protagonist will become the last hope of a medieval fantasy-inspired kingdom against the onslaught of Hellish forces.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BL4-The-Game-Awards.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Borderlands 4 (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>The fifth (despite the title) mainline installment in the cooperative looter shooter series by Gearbox Software was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024 with much fanfare. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-borderlands-4-story-trailer-debuts-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw it again</a> at The Game Awards 2024, where Gearbox debuted a story trailer introducing the new big bad called The Timekeeper. According to the press brief, a world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect order and unleashes chaos on Kairos, the planet Borderlands 4 is set on, which the developers described as the most dangerous planet yet in the series.</p>
<p>The main features revealed so far include deeper, more diverse skill trees; an expanded loot hunt;&nbsp; the ability to travel seamlessly between zones; a dynamic world filled with events and discoverable side content; new traversal mechanics available for both exploration and combat; and even a vehicle that can be summoned almost anywhere on Kairos.</p>

<h2>ARC Raiders (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>Swedish studio Embark may have launched The Finals as their first game, but that was not the first project they announced. That label goes to ARC Raiders, which evolved over the years from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original plan of a PvE co-op shooter</a> to its new form as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PvPvE extraction shooter</a>. We finally got a gameplay trailer of the overhauled game at Geoff Keighley's TGA 2024, and to go with it, Embark shared a thorough overview of the mechanics and features.</p>
<p>In ARC Raiders, players will scavenge the lethal surface in a post-apocalyptic future for supplies and materials, facing enemy ARC machines and other players. As with any extraction game, to keep their loot, players must reach extraction points, risking ambushes to extract vital crafting materials or items to sell to NPC vendors for in-game currency. Players will have their own workshop to craft new equipment, such as advanced weapon mods or unique gadgets, and can also customize their playstyle with a skill tree. NPC merchants will also offer quests to complete on the surface.</p>

<h2>Battlefield 6 (Fall 2025)</h2>
<p>Yes, last but certainly not least, we have the return of Battlefield. After what happened with Battlefield V and 2042, DICE cannot afford to miss again. To that end, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has put Respawn's Vince Zampella in charge of the franchise</a>, and the veteran game designer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the new game will take place in a modern setting. We don't really know many details about Battlefield 6 other than the goal to deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-will-feature-the-most-realistic-and-exciting-destruction-effects-in-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most realistic and exciting destruction ever seen in a game</a> and the fact that there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four development studios busy working on it</a>: DICE (primarily focused on multiplayer), Criterion (both single player and multiplayer), Motive (they're crafting the new campaign), and Ripple Effect (working on a new Battlefield experience, possibly the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-to-launch-in-october-2025-with-f2p-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored free-to-play Battle Royale mode</a>). We should get a lot more official info in the coming months.</p>

			<p>Unknown 9: Awakening got a<a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-gets-new-gameplay-footage/"> lot of buzz</a> before its release, but then it seemed that there was no news or rumblings about it after the game was released. There was just silence. As a result of the game not performing to Reflector Entertainment's expectations, the company has now been hit with layoffs. Unknown 9: Awakening was the first game that was going to be in a series of action-adventure games with an expansive multimedia universe surrounding it. This includes a podcast audio drama, novels, and even comic books. Whether this will happen now is uncertain. It's been posted on the official Reflector Entertainment website that 18% of the workforce has been laid off. However, the post announcing this has now been deleted from the Reflector website.</p>
<p>It's claimed that the layoffs are due to the studio entering a new phase of development, and those who were laid off were not "assigned to roles that our active projects require." To support those impacted by the layoffs, the company has said that they will be supporting them by providing severance packages, "as well as access to medical, emotional, and career planning support."</p>
<p>Considering we aren't out of the first month of the year yet, there have already been a stark number of layoffs, which is what everyone was hoping to see less of this year. There have been approximately 295 people laid off in the gaming industry this year thus far, according to the <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming layoffs website</a> that tracks every known instance of layoffs.</p>
<p>At the moment it's not certain what areas of the company were impacted by the layoffs, but it's reported that it was employees from QA, marketing, art, and narrative. This includes employees like Narrative and Game Designer Anna Karina Bermudez as well as Brand Manager Manou Deneuvel, who have posted on LinkedIn about their new search for employment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hervehoerdt/?originalSubdomain=fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chief Content Officer Herve Hoerdt</a> has also confirmed on LinkedIn that they have canceled a new project that was in the conceptualization phase. It's been said that they scrapped the project as it wouldn't be sustainable for the future of the studio, which has led to redundancies.</p>
<p>Hoerdt also goes on to state that the game's cancelation comes off the back of the "failure" of the company's "ambitious and courageous first project," which was Unknown 9: Awakening. While the specific numbers haven't been stated, he says that the game's sales performance "didn't come near the company expectations."</p>

			<p>The Trump tariffs on imports from Mexico could have a strong impact on the video games market in the United States and lead to fewer disc-based releases and higher prices for both physical and digital games, according to an analyst.</p>
<p>Speaking on Bluesky, Circana Executive Director and Video Game Industry Analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mat Piscatella</a> highlighted how 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico could lead to a "sharp downtick" in the number of physical releases in the United States, as much of the production infrastructure is located in Mexico. If they do get made, prices could rise for both physical and digital games, as digital games' MSRPs would be increased to remain at price parity with physical releases. No matter what happens precisely, however, Mat Piscatella doesn't see anything good coming for the physical video game market in the near future.</p>

<p lang="en">Alright, well, video games.</p>
<p>With 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico on the way, I can see a sharp downtick in the number of disc-based games that get released physically in the US, as much of that production infrastructure is in Mexico.</p>
<p>If they do get made, I expect higher prices both phys &amp; dig.</p>

<p lang="en">I would, were this to happen, anticipate digital MSRPs to increase to remain at price parity with physical, but who knows.</p>

<p>The analyst remarks that moving the production of retail releases to the US to avoid being impacted by the Trump tariffs is definitely possible with significant investment. However, this significant investment is unlikely to come, as annual US physical video game software spending is half what it was in 2021 and is declining rapidly. At the same time, moving production to the US wouldn't help when it comes to cost, so there aren't a lot of incentives to move production to the United States.</p>

<p lang="en">'Can't that production just be moved to the US?'</p>
<p>With significant investment, sure. But annual US physical video game software spending is now half what it was in 2021 and declining rapidly.</p>
<p>And this also wouldn't help when it comes to costs.</p>
<p>Not a good combo to incentive that investment. IMO.</p>

<p>No matter what is going to happen in the near future with the new Trump tariffs, it looks like a price increase for video games seems almost inevitable, and the whole industry seems to be pushing towards it, in one way or another. As highlighted in a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-growth-engine-pricing/">State of Video Gaming in 2025 presentation</a> by CEO of Epyllion Matthew Ball, much of the video game industry is hoping that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be priced higher than the current $70 barrier and thus re-establish packaged game pricing after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.</p>
