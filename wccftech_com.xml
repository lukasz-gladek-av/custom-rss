			<p>A new extremely handy Steam Deck mod is now available for download, allowing users to use AMD FSR 3 Frame Generations in games that support NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation for significantly improved performance.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decky Framegen Plugin</a> is a Steam Deck plugin that replaces the NVIDIA DLSS DLL with the FSR 3.1 DLL, allowing users to use Frame Generation in Steam Deck in games that do not natively support AMD's tech, such as Black Myth Wukong, Final Fantasy XVI, Hogwarts Legacy and The Witcher 3, as showcased in a very informative video put together by Deck Wizard which also provides detailed installation instructions. While the end results aren't always perfect, as there are some visual issues such as ghosting in Final Fantasy XVI, for example, the mod definitely helps make more games playable with acceptable performance on Steam Deck, although games running below 30 FPS won't benefit too much from it due to the input lag caused by the low base framerate.</p>

<p>Since its release back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, the Steam Deck has become an incredibly popular gaming system, essentially bringing forth the age of handheld PCs that doesn't seem will end anytime soon. Following the launch of the original model, Valve released a slightly upgraded model featuring a gorgeous <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-679-usd-an-all-white-exterior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OLED screen</a> and a few other improvements, but the company doesn't seem interested in doing <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-wont-be-doing-yearly-steam-deck-releases/">yearly releases</a>, despite the demand. Earlier this month, it was rumored that a new version of the system powered by the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-amd-ryzen-2-not-works/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APU</a> was in the works, but Valve quickly squashed the rumors, so it will definitely be a while until we will be able to get a proper Steam Deck 2 in our hands.</p>
