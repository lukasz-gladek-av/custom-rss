			<p>The first world premiere trailer shown at The Game Awards 2024 was CD Projekt RED's first look at The Witcher IV. We watched a pre-rendered cinematics running on an unreleased GeForce RTX graphics card (likely the RTX 5090 that's rumored to launch next month) featuring the familiar progression of a The Witcher quest. A young woman is pushed to sacrifice herself to a cursed monster who lives in a nearby forest, only for Cirilla Fiona Riannon to step in and kill the monster first to save the girl... or so she thought.</p>
<p>Once Ciri goes back to the village, she finds the girl dead after being stabbed for not going through the supposedly protective ritual. That's when she utters that monsters, as in humans, not gods, are here.</p>

<p>It's about as The Witcher as you could hope for. There's no release window, of course, but the press release does share a few details on the game. Sebastian Kalemba, Game Director on The Witcher IV, stated:</p>
<p><em>We're kicking off a brand-new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story! It feels so good to finally be able to say those words — for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist of The Witcher IV; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of The Witcher can be.</em></p>
<p>Powered by the same tech that The Witcher IV is built on, using assets and models from the game itself, the trailer aims to provide players with a cinematic look at the kind of experience the game aspires to provide.</p>
<p>The game is<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;in full production</a>, and we might be able to play it within the next couple of years.</p>

			<p>The world of Elden Ring is getting expanded next year with Elden Ring Nightreign, a new action game by FromSoftware launching on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The game, which was revealed with a trailer shown during this year's The Game Awards show, will be a co-op action game featuring characters and locations seen in the original game. Unfortunately, not much else has been said about the game, but it definitely looks like the game will feature the natural evolution of the multiplayer mechanics of the Souls series.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN – REVEAL GAMEPLAY TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given how successful the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">original Elden Ring</a> was, it's not surprising to see FromSoftware capitalizing on it to offer a new experience set in The Lands Between. Earlier this year, the Japanese developer released the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, which is every bit as good as the base game, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches sometime during Summer 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>The Ninja Gaiden series is coming back next year on PC and consoles with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, a game that pays tribute to the series' roots.</p>
<p>The new game, which is being developed by The Game Kitchen as revealed by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16cO1alUFkE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement trailer</a> below, the studio behind Blasphemous, will combine the series' classic role and gameplay from the first 2D entries in the series with the depth and intensity of the modern 3D entries in the series, bringing the best of both areas to modern audiences.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16cO1alUFkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Our story begins when Ryu Hayabusa journeys to America to honor his father's will. While he is away, the barrier between the human and the demon worlds suddenly shatters, unleashing a terrifying army upon the Hayabusa Village, which now faces an unprecedented threat in Ryu's absence. To stand against this new threat, Kenji Mozu, a young ninja from the Hayabusa Village, rises to the challenge!</em></p>

<p>While this may not have been the comeback some fans may have expected, there's no denying that Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is looking quite good. Hopefully, the game will be successful enough to spearhead a resurgence of the franchise, which has been dormant for some time, with developer Team NINJA focusing on other games such as the Nioh series, Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, and this year's Rise of the Ronin.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden Ragebound launches sometime during Summer 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch.</p>
