			<p>The Game Awards 2025 might've received <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999330579041730881">a 'D' grade from viewers who voted in the poll</a> that the show's host and creator, Geoff Keighley, puts up on X (formerly Twitter) every year, but that didn't get people to turn away from the show. Keighley and his Game Awards team have, as they do every year, reported the viewership numbers from this year's show. Just like last year, it's another record-breaking year.</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 was the most-watched Game Awards ever, with 171 million livestreams of the entire show across the globe. Viewership was up 11% compared to last year, conversation about the show on X (formerly Twitter) was up 12% compared to last year, and there were 23,000 co-streams of the show across Twitch and YouTube, which is more than a 50% increase compared to last year.</p>



<p>And all of that doesn't even include the viewership numbers from Amazon Prime Video, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-will-stream-on-amazon-prime-video-for-first-time/">as the show made its Prime Video debut this year</a> as one of the streamer's live events. </p>

<p>The show is undeniably the biggest event of the year within the video games industry, even if it's not the most impactful to the industry, and it has continuously grown exponentially for years now. It's a credit to Keighley and his team that they are able to improve on the show's viewership and reach every year, even if the content of the show itself fluctuates far more than anyone would like to see.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">At Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, Playground Games and Turn10 announced its next installment in its series of Forza games with Forza Horizon 6, which will be set in Japan and will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in 2026. Now that we know what the studios have lined up next, they confirmed the inevitable, though still disappointing news for players, that Forza Motorsport will no longer receive new content updates.</p>



<p>The news was buried in <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-year-in-review-2025">a lengthy blog post on the official Forza website</a>, which provided a recap for the year with some community highlights and a look back at what was added to Forza Horizon 5 and Forza Motorsport.</p>



<p>Shifting to focus on Forza Horizon 6's development was the reason cited by the studios, writing, "<em>As our team shifts its focus toward delivering the best possible experience with Forza Horizon 6 in 2026, we do not plan to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes for Forza Motorsport.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>However, we will continue supporting the game by keeping online servers active, hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime</em>."</p>



<p>At least players can still look forward to competitions in the new year and will get the chance to grab reward cars they may have missed the first time they came around. Forza Motorsport has always offered more of a simulation-based experience compared to a slightly more arcade-y feel in Forza Horizon, so it's good to know that servers and in-game events aren't going away for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Turn10 and Playground Games have to try and ensure they live up to the expectations players have for Forza Horizon 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/">and the expectations they're setting for themselves</a>. According to a recent rumour, we'll be able to see if Forza Horizon 6 hits its mark <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">when it arrives sometime in the first half of 2026</a>.</p>
