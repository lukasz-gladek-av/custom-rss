			<p>A new Fortnite Chapter 6 launch trailer has leaked early, and has revealed that Godzilla and some other bosses will be making their way into the incredibly popular Battle Royale. The trailer has yet to be officially released by Epic Games, but data miners did what they do best and found it within the game files, as seen on the <a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X account Guille_GAG</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Chapter 6 Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwo6rD62Gsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this new gameplay trailer, you get to see a glimpse at some of the new skins and bosses that will be available in the upcoming Chapter. You also get to see Godzilla, who is walking around the map, according to the trailer. At the moment, it's uncertain whether Godzilla is a boss that you'll be able to take down in Fortnite, but considering that the new map is Japan-inspired, it seems likely that he will be. Some of the other bosses you get to see in the trailer include a samurai, a demon mask, and a giant turtle. Although considering how cute the giant turtle is, it's more hopeful that it's a form of transportation rather than something you have to take down.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is going to be a pretty big deal in the Fortnite community, as it's set to revamp the game significantly. However, there are some features that are being brought back in this chapter that are familiar and have been in the game previously. This includes Samurai swords. From what little is seen in the trailer of them, it seems that they are used functionally the same as they were when they were previously in the game.</p>
<p>A Japan-inspired map isn't exactly new to Fortnite either, as there was a Japanese-themed biome in Chapter 4, and some of the architecture seen in the trailer feels very similar to the buildings in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>Moving on from similarities, Big Hero 6's Baymax will also be coming to Fortnite and will be available via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass</a>, where you'll get to do his signature 'Balalala' as an emote. There also seem to be some new Mask items that players will be able to get, as well as the ability to wall jump. This all seems very much to do with the Samurai vibe that they have going on in this new Chapter and will allow a new way to engage in combat as players will be able to climb over a wall and immediately start shooting or swinging their swords, as seen in the trailer.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is set to launch this weekend, and it's likely we'll see some more details emerge about the upcoming Chapter in the next day or so.</p>

			<p>The upcoming title by Hotta Studio, Neverness to Everness, has officially launched its limited-scale Chinese Closed Beta Test that begins on November 28, 2024. This will allow players in China to explore the upcoming supernatural urban open-world RPG, and get to see some of the fresh new content that has been added by Hotta Studio. While other countries are currently unable to participate in the Closed Beta, anyone interested in the game will be able to <a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-register for Neverness to Everness</a> on the official website. There is also the option to stay up to date with any news that is released by Hotta Studio by following them on X or joining their Discord server.</p>
<p>For those who are just hearing about this game for the first time, it is a fresh and lighthearted game that is full of comedy rather than a game with a lot of serious subjects and tones. By doing so, the developers are aiming to create a relaxed atmosphere for those who play Neverness to Everness. The game's character expressions and animations have been fine-tuned to enhance each scene that players will get to watch so that the emotional nuances of each scene and humorous details can shine through in the storyline.</p>
<p>In this game, players will get to explore the everyday life of Hethereau, a city where there are both anomalies and humans co-existing. There are three chapters of main storyline content thus far and multiple side quests that players can dive into, allowing them to explore the urban life of Hethereau and the secrets that come along with it.</p>
<p>Neverness to Everness is developed using Unreal Engine 5 to help provide beautiful realism with a ton of detail, giving the players an immersive experience as they traverse the city and get to experience the supernatural. There are drastic changes between environments, with some offering neon-lit streets and marketplaces, while others are mysterious and dark, full of anomalies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">initial reveal for this game was back in July</a>, and the developers have since added more characters for Beta testers to meet and try out. This includes Adler, who is a playable character, and Edgar, who is a member of the Eibon Antique Shop and will be accompanying the protagonist throughout their adventure in Hethereau.</p>
<p>Those who get the chance to participate in the Closed Beta test will get to experience some new chapter bosses, anomaly commission bosses, and, of course, new storyline content to provide them with an in-depth experience of what's to come in the full release of the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lies of P DLC to Launch in Q1 2025; NEOWIZ Now Working on a Sci-Fi Survival Horror Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game.1048050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P DLC</a> isn't coming before the end of the year. We kind of guessed it due to the lack of news, but Korean website EBN now <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> today that NEOWIZ confirmed it will be available in the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio is recruiting level designers and scenario planners for a new survival horror game set in a sci-fi universe. The title will be made with Unreal Engine 5 and released for PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The report also claims that NEOWIZ is in 'dire need' of a new success. While Lies of P <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed well last year</a>, selling a million units in less than a month despite being available on the Game Pass subscription service, this year the company did not have any major release in its lineup, which led to a 21% decrease in sales and a 68% decrease in operating profit.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why the Korean studio recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-studio-will-publish-an-upcoming-noir-western-rpg-from-ex-cdpr-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a publishing deal with Polish developer ZAKAZANE, founded by former CD Projekt RED developers. NEOWIZ will publish their upcoming single-player noir Western roleplaying game.</p>
<p>Lies of P earned an 8 out of 10 score here on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>Wearing its influences on its sleeves, Lies of P is a solid imitation of FromSoftware's Bloodborne that manages to stay fun for the entire duration of a single playthrough of around 20 hours despite a marked lack of innovation. While the callbacks and nods to the game that inspired it may be a little too blatant, NEOWIZ has developed a solid game that all soulslike fans can enjoy if they can keep their expectations in check.</em></p>
<p><em>Not even attempting to hide the massive influence Bloodborne has had on it, Lies of P is a solid imitation of the game developed by FromSoftware. While it lacks the same combat and world design finesse of its illustrious inspiration, the action role-playing game by NEOWIZ is among the most accomplished soulslike game released this year, thanks to its dark retelling of the story of Pinocchio, combat and character customization tweaks and great enemy design.</em></p>

			<p>A new playable demo of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Unreal Engine 5.5. fan made remake by CryZENx is now available for download, allowing fans to experience another remade portion of the classic game by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/116896739?utm_campaign=postshare_creator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, features a short sequence starting with the Ging Dodongo fight and ending shortly after reaching the Great Fairy and getting the magic bar. What makes these short sequences impressive is the accurate recreation of both the visuals and gameplay mechanics of the classic, making this demo a must-play for those wanting to experience a small portion of the classic entry in the series in a modernized way.</p>
<p>The Zelda: Ocarina of Time Unreal Engine 5.5. remake creator CryZENx also shared a video showcasing the demo. You can find it right below.</p>

<p>CryZENx has been working on this The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Unreal Engine 5 remake for a good while, showing time and time again what an <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-ocarina-of-time-remake-comparison/">excellent job they are doing</a>. While there's no doubt Nintendo would shut down the project if it were ever released as a full game, hopefully, the Japanese company will take note of it and release a proper, modern remake of the game for one of its future gaming systems.</p>
