			<p>Ahead of their launch later this week, NVIDIA has reminded players of a few more titles that will be launching with support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4, including Anno 117: Pax Romana, Assetto Corsa Rally, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-rally-revealed-launches-early-access-november-2025/">new rally racing game from Supernova Games Studios and 505 Games</a>, which also marks the first time the Assetto Corsa series has ventured into the world of rally racing. It was built on an adapted version of KUNOS Simulazioni's physics engine that has been the foundation for the entire Assetto Corsa series. Assetto Corsa Rally is also the second Assetto Corsa release of the year after Assetto Corsa EVO.</p>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation when it launches in early access on November 13, 2025, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 needs no introduction as the latest entry in the long-running annual shooter series, which is launching this coming Friday, November 14, 2025, with support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is another new entry in a long-running series, though a very different kind of game from Call of Duty. This new city-builder and strategy game puts players in Ancient Rome and charges them with deciding between instituting Roman traditions in its new Celtic colonies, or if you'll kick off a new era of Ancient Rome, letting Celtic traditions mix with Rome's to create something entirely new.</p>



<p>It'll arrive on PC on November 13, 2025, and with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Lastly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332430/Chip_n_Clawz_vs_The_Brainioids/">Chip n' Clawz vs. The Brainoids</a> is a new action-strategy game from developer Snapshot Games and publisher Arc Games from the creator of XCOM, Julian Gollop. It's a mix of third-person action and real-time strategy gameplay, and after launching earlier this year in August, it'll add support for DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana, Black Ops 7, and Assetto Corsa Rally will <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-add-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-anno-117-pax-romana-in-november-2025/">also be available to play through NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
