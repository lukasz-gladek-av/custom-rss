			<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/aion2-splitgate-arena-reloaded-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/">Another five games have received support</a> for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation this week, including Yakuza Kiwami 2, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and ARK: Lost Colony. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-dying-light-the-beast-update-1-5-nightmare-experience/">Dying Light: The Beast</a> adds support for ray-tracing, Lost Ark added support for DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA put out a new GeForce Ready game driver to support it all.</p>



<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">the return of Splitgate 2</a>, and the first Splitgate, as developer 1047 Games has opted to try and mash together the best of both games into one offering for players. It arrived as a free-to-play game on PC and consoles everywhere as of yesterday, December 17, and has support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to ensure that you can get the most out of your hardware. It's also the exact kind of game you'd want to play at the highest frame rate possible, as a competitive first-person shooter.</p>



<p>If you are playing it, that is. Splitgate 2's launch went very poorly, and, while SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, at least on PC, the release of Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#3m">doesn't seem to have turned things around</a> when looking at the concurrent player numbers.</p>



<p>For Yakuza Kiwami 2, a recent update to the game added DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation, and now, if you load it up alongside the NVIDIA app, you can boost your experience further with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation with the app's DLSS overrides.</p>



<p>MMORPG Ashes of Creation, which recently launched as a new early access title on PC, also did so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. Also, speaking of SteamDB numbers, it's one of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4124950/charts/">trending games on the platform at the time of this writing</a>. </p>



<p>ARK: Lost Colony and AION2 are the final two games to round out the five that are getting support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, with AION2 getting support on December 24, 2025, as part of a new update, and ARK: Lost Colony featuring support for DLSS 4 today as part of a new update.</p>



<p>Lastly, today's new GeForce Game Ready driver will ensure that you're able to jump into all of these games without issue, as it fixes a colour issue from the previous driver and several other bug fixes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few weeks ago, the hopes of the Half-Life community were sparked by rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 is not only in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">active development</a></strong>, but also <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">in the polishing and optimization phase</a></strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/"><strong>close to an announcement.</strong></a> Now that we are so close to the holidays, however, it's unlikely that even a company like Valve that operates on its own set of rules will announce the project before the end of the year, as previously rumored.</p>



<p>The now-legendary game not being announced in 2025 has shattered the hopes of many, who no longer believe a new entry in the series will be released in the near future. However, the lack of an official announcement shouldn't make you lose hope, as the project rumored to be the third entry in the Valve series hasn't been abandoned. On the contrary, it has received a new update which is sure to spark new hope in fans.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV"><strong>Tyler McVicker</strong></a>, who has provided an in-depth look at the latest updates made to the HLX project found in the Source 2 engine in the past, the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-Dota2/commit/5688664efb6b3a0e6a52abec53f8d0d7990d1f71"><strong>Dota 2 December 16 2025 update</strong></a> introduced new strings of code directly related to the project rumored to be Half-Life 3.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Based on how the Half-Life community lately, should I even make a video detailing the dump of new information found in the latest DOTA 2 update? </p><p>I don't know...</p><p>I guess this game doesn't exist.... Oh well.... <a href="https://t.co/nFcNYv9ynt">pic.twitter.com/nFcNYv9ynt</a></p></div>— Tyler "Hype Merchant" McVicker (@Tyler_McV) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/2001331835373265408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While an in-depth explanation of what these new additions mean for the HLX project has yet to be provided, the community verified that these updates are real and confirmed on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">this comprehensive community-managed Miro board</strong></a> that they are related to the Animgraph 2 system, a new animation resolve system designed to replace the previous system, which caused large bandwidth consumption in multiplayer games. For those not interested in game development, these additions are still important to know about, as it is undeniable proof that the development of HLX is proceeding.</p>



<p>What these updates don't suggest, on the other hand, is when the HLX project will be officially revealed. According to rumors, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/">Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch game targeting a Spring 2026 release</a></strong>, so if these plans haven't changed, it shouldn't be long until we will finally learn if and how the iconic series by Valve will continue following the VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-unveiled-next-month/"><strong>Half-Life: Alyx.</strong></a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/newzoo-expects-global-video-games-market-reach-197-billion-2025-exceeds-expectations/</link>
            <guid>1387171</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published its year-in-review <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/year-in-review-2025-to-date">report for January to November 2025</a> for the global video games market, a year marked by the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, and engagement-driven growth on PC, beating out consoles and mobile. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">After yesterday's news from Circana</a> outlining how November 2025 was one of the worst months for US physical game sales and hardware sales in 30 years, Newzoo's report on the global industry is a reminder that, at least on the consumer side, things are still trending in a positive direction. Issues like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">tariffs, the rising cost of living</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/after-dell-acer-asus-have-surrendered-to-memory-shortages/">now memory shortages</a> could have more of an impact in 2026, but as of the end of 2025, Newzoo expects the global games market to rise 7.5% compared to 2024 when all the 2025 numbers are tallied.</p>



<p>That's an increase to <strong>$197 billion</strong>, with mobile games expected to grow to  <strong>$108 billion (a 7.7%</strong> <strong>increase)</strong>, console gaming expected to hit <strong>$45 billion (a 4.2% increase), </strong>and PC gaming expected to grow to <strong>$43 billion (a 10.4% increase)</strong>. The PC and mobile growth is what exceeded Newzoo's expectations, and the key drivers behind the expected growth getting to just shy of $200B, though, if growth continues in the way Newzoo predicts, the industry will be far past $200B by next year.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-6.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Newzoo expects mobile to remain strong due to its stock of ol'reliable titles from publishers like Tencent and Century Games and the momentum perpetuated by new hits, much like how the console industry is kept up by the routine and habits of console gamers going back to major franchises each year, growth on PC is a bit more interesting. </p>



<p>That's exemplified in the top 10 games on PC by revenue for the year. Some of the games are major franchises, but none of them are free-to-play titles, and all of them are games that were released in 2025. "<em>The 2025 outcome reflects players spending more deeply within games and ecosystems they already value, rather than growth being driven by a sudden expansion of the player base</em>," said principal market analyst, Michiel Buijsman.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Two of the top 10 are indie titles, and three of the top 10 are brand new games not based on a pre-existing franchise on PC, which Newzoo says is "<em>reflecting a broad appetite for varied experiences</em>" and <em>"PC's relative openness to new IP and system-driven design</em>." It's also further signs that, while console games may take centre stage more often as far as what hits the mainstream, PC is still where the core industry is. </p>



<p>On console, the top 10 does clear one of the same bars that the PC list clears, which is that they're all games released in 2025, but none of them are indie titles or new franchises. They're all major franchises, and half the list are even annual releases. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-2.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>EA is the winningest publisher with nearly half the list in its portfolio, though perhaps the most impressive inclusion is Pokemon Legends Z-A, which made it despite only being available on one platform.</p>



<p>Both of those lists are tallied by revenue, whereas the engagement lists (tallied by monthy active users) for PC and console are a different story. Only one of the titles in the top 10 on PC isn't based on a pre-existing franchise, while all of the games on the console list for the top 10 games by MAUs are major franchises.</p>



<p>As a side note, the top 10 console games by MAUs is in fact the only list in Newzoo's report where Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 makes the top 10. Battlefield 6 is still in that top 10, and made it on every the revenue and MAU list for both PC and consoles. It's still early of course, but at this point it feels safe to call it: Battlefield beat Call of Duty in 2025, and there's practically no question about it.</p>

</figure>



<p>Lastly, the final key points from Newzoo's report, as it looks back at 2025 and towards the future to 2026, is that indie games were a huge factor in this year's industry conversation, largely due to successes like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which capped off its stellar year by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">winning a record number of awards at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year</a>. </p>



<p>And as we look ahead, 2025's most significant moves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">like EA moving to privatize</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's opening of Vantage Studios</a> mean that the industry is going through a massive shift. "<em>The EA deal reflects a broader structual shift toward ownership concentration and tighter portfolio management,</em>" said Manu Rosier, director of market intelligence at Newzoo.</p>



<p>"<em>A smaller number of companies now control a larger share of the industry's most influential IP, while platforms increasingly shape which games are funded, distributed, and scaled</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune Awakening Chapter 3 Brings ‘Bigger, Better’ Endgame, New Content and Lots More, Says Funcom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-3-brings-bigger-better-endgame-new-content-and-more/</link>
            <guid>1387168</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has unveiled Dune Awakening Chapter 3, an upcoming update for its survival crafting game set in the world based on Frank Herbert's novels and Denis Villeneuve's movies.</p>



<p>Dune Awakening launched in June 2025 on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling one million copies in a couple of weeks</a> and becoming Funcom's fastest-selling game release to date. However, it was quickly evident that there wasn't enough content, and a lot of players left the game after a short while.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Game Director Joel Bylos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told me</a> the team wasn't worried, as the core is among the best games in the genre and it just needed more content and fixes. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a>, that's exactly what Funcom plans to add to Dune Awakening, starting with Chapter 3.</p>



<p>First and foremost, the developers aim to deliver a 'bigger, better' endgame, powered by a comprehensive redesign of the Tier 6 experience. Players will find deeper progression choices and more meaningful advancement paths, thanks to specializations dedicated to Crafting, Gathering, Exploring, Combat, and Sabotage. This will allow non‑combat focused players to progress endgame content without forced PvP or dungeon raiding.</p>



<p>The Landraad system, Dune Awakening's server-wide political system where player guilds align with the Great Houses (Atreides, Harkonnen), complete weekly tasks, and vote on decrees that affect everyone on the server, has reportedly been remade from scratch and now features new repeatable missions, expanded reward tiers, and stronger incentives for participation. The Faction ranks progression has been extended, too. There will be new contracts specific to each faction's objectives (Atreides, Harkonnen, independent groups). </p>



<p>A completely new Augmentation Station is being introduced as an upgrade path for late‑game gear customization. Players will be able to attach powerful augments to Unique Tier 6 gear to customize their playstyle further. On the PvE side, Funcom is adding five brand-new overland 'challenge sites', including 'The Broodworks'. Completing these areas provides faction progress, increases Landsraad contribution, and grants Specialization XP. Furthermore, Dune Awakening Chapter 3 will introduce five new Testing Stations. These are repeatable, dungeon-like content featuring boss fights, increasing difficulty and appropriately valuable rewards. </p>



<p>The story is going forward, too. The player's narrative journey will continue with the introduction of unexpected allies, fighting through the Neo Carthag dueling ring, and delving deeper into the mystery of the player character's origins. When it comes to combat, the Rapier is being fully reworked, and a new 'Pyrocket' melee weapon (dual-wielded knives) will be available with the update.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside Dune Awakening Chapter 3, Funcom will launch the paid Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, which can be purchased for $9.99 (but is included with the $24.99 Season Pass). Its additions are cosmetic-only: 73 new building pieces and 17 decorations inspired by the Imperium's Smugglers, a dedicated stillsuit set, a light and heavy armor set, weapon variants, swatches, and emotes.</p>



<p>The game is available at a 35% discount, the largest one yet since launch, in the Steam Winter Sale that starts today. Funcom did not share a timeframe for Chapter 3 and the Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, but more details should be released in early 2026. Later next year, the game is supposed to launch on consoles as well.</p>
