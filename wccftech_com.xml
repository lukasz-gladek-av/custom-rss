			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed</a>, which means we'll have to keep going back to Grand Theft Auto V to get a fix for Rockstar's best-selling franchise. If you're one of the handful of people who have yet to play one of the highest-selling video games ever, it looks like you'll get another chance, at least on PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, Grand Theft Auto V is heading back to the PS Plus Extra games catalogue.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun and Dealabs have a strong track record when it comes to reporting PS Plus games, whether it's one of, or sometimes all three, of the three games offered for the Essential tier, or one of the games entering the catalogue at the Extra tier.</p>



<p>This report pertains to the latter, as we've already had the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/">three games for November at the PS Plus Essential tier</a> revealed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-playstation-plus-november-2025/">one of which Billbil-kun also correctly reported ahead of the official announcement</a>).</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also predicts that this coming Wednesday, November 12, we'll get the official reveal of what games are coming to the PS Plus Extra catalogue, which will include Grand Theft Auto V.</p>



<p>With GTA VI delayed, it lines up perfectly that GTA V would re-enter the PS Plus Extra catalogue, just to make it as accessible as possible for people wanting to remain immersed in the world of Grand Theft Auto on their consoles. It's already available on Xbox Game Pass, so having it back on PlayStation's subscription service just rounds out where players can find it.</p>



<p>Regarding the additional delay for GTA VI, Take-Two boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/">Strauss Zelnick says the company has <em>"never regretted</em>" delaying a game</a>. At least it looks like we'll get another way to play GTA V in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Chinese developer miHoYo, the studio behind the popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/genshin-impact-gacha-highjacked/">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/zenless-zone-zero-the-perfect-gacha-game-for-those-who-dont-like-gachas/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, is working on a new game that will be much different from anything it has released so far.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">As spotted on the&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/" target="_blank">ResetERA forums</a>, the developer is currently working on a fantasy open-world MMO featuring realistic graphics, PvP, an AI-stimulated ecological system, large-scale boss fights, and advanced AI-powered NPCs.</span> These new features will mark a significant shift in gameplay terms, and a considerable step forward from the games the developer is currently supporting.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The teaser shared by miHoYo as part of a recruitment effort for their Unreal Engine 5-powered new game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides sharing the first information on the yet to be named game, miHoYo released a video providing a very early look at the visual style the studio is aiming for has also been released, and it looks more technically advanced than anything it has done to date. Hopefully, the developer will also be able to address the known performance issues that plague games powered by the engine to deliver an experience that can be on par with its previous games.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The upcoming project from miHoYo, alongside other open-world games such as Where Winds Meet, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/">launching globally on November 14</a>, seems to signal a radical change for free-to-play open world games, which are doing away with colorful and stylized visuals to offer experiences that are edging ever closer to the PC and console premium AAA experiences. As such, it will be fascinating to see how players will react to these experiences, and if the realistic visuals and advanced AI-powered features will make these games as big a hit as Genshin Impact.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-bioshock-is-now-on-a-great-track-to-take-the-franchise-to-the-next-level-says-take-two-ceo.1346785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been twelve and a half years since Irrational Games launched BioShock Infinite, the last installment in the immersive single player first-person shooter franchise. Franchise creator Ken Levine notoriously decided to disband the studio and form the much smaller Ghost Story Games, which is now working on Judas. Levine recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-similar-bioshock-some-ways-radically-different-in-others/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that Judas shares some similarities with the BioShock franchise, but it is also different in many ways.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Take-Two's publishing label 2K <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2019 that a brand new studio called Cloud Chamber, headquartered in Novato, California, would take stewardship of the BioShock IP. Cloud Chamber had its own fair share of troubles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebooting the project in 2023</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffering a big round of layoffs</a> (affecting around 80 employees) as recently as this August, which delayed the new BioShock to the latter half of 2027, according to credible sources.</p>



<p>The former Studio Head, Kelley Gilmore, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced by industry veteran Rod Fergusson</a>, who previously worked at Epic Games, The Coalition, and Blizzard, among others. Fergusson is known to be well-versed in taking over and focusing a studio's resources toward the successful completion of a game, and that's precisely what's needed here. Indeed, speaking during Take-Two's Q2 2026 earnings call (the same one that announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the delay of GTA VI</a>), CEO Strauss Zelnick said the game is now on a great track to take the franchise to the next level. Here's the quote:</p>



<p><em>We’re very excited that we brought Rod on to lead Cloud Chamber. He is the new head of the BioShock franchise. He’s obviously an incredible industry veteran. He’s got history with the BioShock franchise, specifically with Infinite. He’s also been involved with Gears of War and Diablo. We’re just so grateful that he’s come to work with us at Cloud Chamber. BioShock is a very important franchise for us. It’s one of our biggest franchises. We’re very excited about the release of the next BioShock. We’ve made some changes in the organization. We’re shifting some things around. Right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that’s going to exceed consumers’ expectations. Not much more to update other than the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises.</em></p>



<p>It may take a while, as mentioned above, but franchise fans will be able to tide themselves over with Judas (which is 'coming up', according to Zelnick, and is likely to be ready before the BioShock game) and the BioShock Netflix film adaptation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be directed by The Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence</a> and should begin production after Lawrence finishes shooting the next movie in that franchise (Sunrise on the Reaping).</p>
