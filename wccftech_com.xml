			<p>Publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/">11 Bit Studios</a> and developer Digital Sun have announced that a sequel to Moonlight will be released next year. The sequel is called Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>. Moonlighter was an incredibly successful indie game with tons of replayability. In this game, you'll get to step back into the shoes of merchant Will, in this roguelike action title, where you get to see adventure and shopkeeping combine to make a fun adventure. Just like in Moonlighter, you have to go on a long and arduous journey that takes you through vibrant landscapes as you try to uncover mysterious relics. Of course, there will be tons of enemies along the way, traps, and challenges that are set to make your journey more challenging than it already is. Luckily, you'll have an arsenal of weapons, including your iconic backpack from the first game.</p>

<p>When you make it back from your journey, you'll be back at your cozy shop, which also serves as your home and hub, allowing you to turn the goodies you discovered into profit. You can haggle for the best prices, assist customers and make sure to keep your store looking spic and span while adding decorations and perks and dealing with the mess. Of course, you will also be able to utilize your profit to upgrade your gear, as well as upgrade your store to get the most benefits from it.</p>
<p>"The original Moonlighter was a pivotal moment for us, marking the growth of Digital sun as a team. Five years on, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault showcases everything we've learned along the way. We're channeling all our craftsmanship into creating a game that's not just better, but brimming with even more charm in every detail," says Digital Sun CEO Javier Gimenez.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're looking forward to, make sure to check out the trailer above. It showcases some of the reminiscent details from the original game while setting the scene of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault.</p>
<p>There are many great features to look forward to in the upcoming release of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, including a brilliant soundtrack made by Chris Larkin, who also made the iconic soundtrack for Hollow Knight.</p>
