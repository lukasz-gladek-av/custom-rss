			<p>Samsung announced its highly anticipated Galaxy S25 lineup last month, which comes with more or less the same design, but the internals have been improved a lot. The raw computational and graphical performance is far superior to the company's Galaxy S24 lineup, and it will make a lot of difference if you are into mobile gaming. A new comparison test was conducted between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the gaming performance reflects which device is better at running Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro Max roasts the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact with a solid 95 FPS average compared to the latter's 60 FPS</h2>
<p>The App Store and Play Store offer a wide range of high-end games that make the right use of the chips in the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. A new comparison test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DameTech">Dame Tech on YouTube</a> highlights the performance of the Galaxy S25 Ultra against the iPhone 16 Pro Max in Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves. The test will detail the FPS of both games, along with performance throttling and power usage on the flagship smartphones and how they compare against each other.</p>
<p>One important aspect to note at this point is that the iPhone has been the top-performing gaming device. Dame Tech mentions that despite the Galaxy S25 Ultra's exclusive high-resolution settings for games, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a better in-game resolution. We also have to take note that the Snapdragon 8 Elite's <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-chip-for-galaxy-s25-is-faster/">exclusive chip</a> has better performance on paper, and it is reflected in the overall performance of both Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the comparison video below, the game settings were set to maximum, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra maintains a solid 59.2 FPS across Wuthering Waves with minor ups and downs. Additionally, the game plays smoothly with no stutter whatsoever, which goes on to show that Snapdragon's exclusive chip for the Galaxy S25 Ultra is pushing performance on par with the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, which scored 59 FPS.</p>
<p>However, we have to consider the higher power draw for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, taking in as much as 7.2 Watts against 5.4 Watts on the iPhone. Additionally, the iPhone 16 Pro Max was played at a higher 1705 x 786 resolution compared to the Galaxy. Moreover, the test also revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro Max maintained almost the same level of frame rates while running more than 10 degrees cooler than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It clearly shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-performance-cores-overclocked-can-beat-a18-pro-in-single-score-benchmark/">A18 Pro chip</a> is handling the high-end game quite easily compared to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the iPhone 16 Pro Max crushes the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact on the highest settings, maintaining 95.2 FPS on average and reaching as high as 120 FPS on several occasions at a higher resolution. The Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be running at a steady 60 FPS, likely due to a frame rate cap implemented by the game developers. The iPhone 16 Pro Max also ran a few degrees cooler.</p>
<p><iframe title="Galaxy S25 Ultra vs iPhone 16 Pro Max in Genshin Impact &amp; Wuthering Waves | Android &amp; iOS Gaming" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2lcs_lw2og?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the iPhone 16 Pro Max performed better, Samsung has finally introduced a device that can compete against the iPhone. In addition, it is possibly the best gaming smartphone when it comes to competition from Android. We will share more details on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its performance, so do stay tuned.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be fully backward compatible with Switch titles. However, fans have been wondering for how long Nintendo would continue to release games for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the subject in the company's usual post-quarterly earnings <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A with investors</a>. The executive said that more original Switch games will be made, but at the same time, he highlighted the importance of Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p><em>We have already announced Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond for Nintendo Switch in 2025. We will continue developing Nintendo Switch titles, but launching exclusive games for Nintendo Switch 2 is essential for its success. However, we aim to ensure a smooth transition between the two platforms.</em></p>
<p>This tells us that it may not be long before we get the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, as Nintendo has a vested interest in getting users to transition from one generation to another. Besides, the original Switch is clearly on a downward trajectory for its sales, as evidenced even in the last quarter during which 'only' 4.82 million units were sold. Still, it was enough to allow the hybrid console to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break the big 150 million sales milestone</a>.</p>
<p>Third-party may leave behind the original Nintendo Switch even quicker. Since they already largely switched from PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X as the default targets for new games, it won't make much sense for them to spend time trying to make more complex titles fit the aging Switch hardware when there's a new platform with support for technologies like NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Nintendo Switch 2 is slated to launch later this year. Between April and June, hands-on events will take place worldwide; before that, on April 2, Nintendo will unveil many more details about the new console. So far, analysts have <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded positively</a> to the brief teaser trailer shared in January.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/ninja-gaiden-2-black-five-essential-techniques-to-master-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 has been long considered among the finest character action games ever released, but a complete newcomer to the series will hardly feel the same when playing any of the game's iterations, including the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>. The game developed by Team NINJA is unlike action games from other studios like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, as it is a game that pushes players to play as optimally as possible, not just to hit high scores as in the Bayonetta series but to actually survive combat encounters, which can get hectic fast.</p>
<p>As such, the best way to understand the brilliance of the Ninja Gaiden 2 Black experience is to learn and master the game, starting with some essential techniques that will help you during your first playthrough and teach you how to handle the game's many challenges to take on higher difficulty settings.</p>
<h2>Stand Your Ground</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250127184908_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike other action games, blocking in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is an extremely powerful defensive technique that is way more effective than dodging in the vast majority of combat scenarios. As such, don't hesitate to keep the block button pushed down as enemies come at you, as you will be able to negate all damage safely. Sometimes, your guard may be broken, but you can easily avoid damage by pushing the left stick in the direction you want to dodge. Blocking will also become available as soon as the dodging animation is complete, allowing you to continue negating damage.</p>
<p>By just defending, however, you aren't going to defeat your enemies, so you should use blocking to learn enemy patterns and unleash combos and special techniques when it is safe to do so. Think of offense and defense in Ninja Gaiden 2 as in a fighting game, where some moves are safe on block and some aren't.</p>
<h2>Master Flying Swallow and Izuna Drop</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135242_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While each weapon has tons of combos and special techniques, which are further expanded with upgrades, there are some techniques that are absolutely essential to master. The first one is the Flying Swallow, a special aerial attack that can be used by jumping and pressing heavy attack and a direction to safely attack enemies and quickly reposition if needed. The second one is the iconic Izuna Drop, which is unleashed with select weapons by launching an enemy in the air and hitting them with three light attacks and one heavy attack. What makes this technique so useful is the fact that it instantly kills enemies.</p>
<p>The best thing about these two techniques is that they are available for use right from the very beginning of the game, as it is possible to perform them with Ryu's starting weapon, the Dragon Sword. They can be used with other weapons as well, so experiment with them to find which works best for you.</p>
<h2>Take Advantage of Ninpo Spells' Invincibility</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135610_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninpo Spells are another important part of Ryu Hayabusa's arsenal in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, as they can be used to unleash some rather powerful attacks. What makes them more useful than they may look at a glance is the invincibility some of them grant before the spell goes off. Use this invincibility window to get some heat off of you.</p>
<h2>Learn When to Use Ultimate Techniques Properly</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135327_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimate Techniques are among the least used combat techniques in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black by beginners, as they can be difficult to use properly with little knowledge of enemies' patterns and abilities as they require charging. However, you really should learn how to use them properly if you want to truly master the game, as they are extremely powerful and they can clear enemy groups in very little time.</p>
<p>The best way to use Ultimate Techniques properly is to start charging them when there's Essence floating around, which speeds up the charging process considerably once absorbed. As such, you will want to not absorb the resource right after an enemy is defeated, and there are two ways to do this: you either keep yourself away from it as much as possible, or you keep blocking. Position yourself properly by jumping and then blocking as soon as you land, start charging your Ultimate Attack, and watch your enemies explode in a glorious, gory mess.</p>
<h2>Watch and Adapt</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250129191059_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite the general high speed of the experience, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black wants players to really look at enemies and not just to learn their attack patterns. After dealing some damage, Ryu may cut limbs from enemies, which not only limits their abilities, although they get access to desperate and damaging new attacks,&nbsp; but makes them susceptible to dismemberment, which can be accomplished by hitting them with a heavy attack. Given how important it is to reduce enemy numbers as quickly as possible, always keep an eye on the enemy's current state, and unleash insta-kill attacks as soon as possible!</p>
