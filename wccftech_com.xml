			<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is officially out next week, on September 25, 2025, but that official release date hasn't stopped physical copies of the game from finding their way out into the wild early. While physical copies of a racing game don't exactly mean big narrative spoilers are about to hit the wire the way it would for other titles getting out early, in this case, it does seem to mean the rest of the DLC collaborations SEGA had planned getting leaked early.</p>



<p>A photo of a postcard that came with physical copies of the game, which is stored inside the case, shows the remaining three collaborations that SEGA has yet to announce for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The image was posted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1nkh9h8/so_about_the_final_unannounced_collab_dlc/">Sonic the Hedgehog Reddit</a>, revealing that the next three collaborations after the already announced Minecraft, Pac-Man, and Spongebob collaborations are: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Avatar Legends, and Mega Man.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, this doesn't necessarily reveal which characters from each of the above series will be included. The <a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/racers.html">official website</a> for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds shows eight mystery spots in the roster of DLC characters. Half of those could be filled by the Turtles, but the image specifically lists TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, so we could see other characters beyond the four teenage turtles, and that's before mentioning that there might be a greater focus on including characters from the other three series.</p>



<p>At the very least, we know to expect new tracks, characters, and vehicles related to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Avatar Legends, and Megaman. Also, since this information was featured in a postcard coming with physical copies of the game that will be officially available in just a few days, it's likely we'll hear a proper announcement from SEGA regarding these DLC collaborations soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Wccftech's review</a> of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds from Nathan Birch, who writes, "<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaked-casting-calls-for-amazon%E2%80%99s-mass-effect-tv-series-stir-speculation-the-adaptation-will-feature-male-shepard.1302009/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/">Four years ago</a>, we first heard a report that Amazon was crossing the 't's on a deal with EA and BioWare to make a Mass Effect TV series adaptation. Now, we know the deal went through, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">Daniel Casey</a> was tapped to write the show, followed by<a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/"> Doug Jung</a> being selected to be its showrunner, and we've even had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">confidence-boosting confirmation</a> that the same production team of artists who excellently brought Fallout to life will also be working on Mass Effect.</p>



<p>All of that still leaves a whole pile of unanswered questions, but a recent leak might've just begun to answer one of the most major questions in the series: which Shepard will it be?</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-tv-series-casting-calls-leak-sparking-speculation-male-shepard-is-canon">Eurogamer</a>, entertainment reporter and insider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/mass-effect-138895669">Daniel Richtman</a> leaked five casting calls for Amazon's Mass Effect TV series. The calls don't explicitly say which character they're casting, but anyone familiar enough with the series can make educated guesses, and one of the calls points to Amazon choosing to go with Male Shepard for its iteration of the story.</p>



<p>The five calls are, per Eurogamer, "<em>a young Colin Farrell-type male (30-39) with open ethnicity, a female co-lead alien character requiring prosthetics (34-39), a female human providing a parallel narrative from Earth, a Doug Jones-type male villain (40-60), and a male wrestler-type soldier (30-49).</em>"</p>



<p>Fans of the series have speculated that the 'male wrestler-type' is a casting call for James Vega, while the villain casting call points to Saren Arterius. The female co-lead is very likely a casting call for Liara T'Soni, while the other female casting call could be Emily Wong, a reworked version of Ashley Williams story, or a twin Shepard, by fans best approximations.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, it's the first call listed that's causing the most ruckus, as fans are speculating that it is pointing to the show's lead, Commander Shepard, and casting for a male means Amazon has chosen to go with Mark Meer's Male Shepard over Jennifer Hale's FemShep.</p>



<p>When Casey spoke about having the Fallout production team work on Mass Effect earlier this year, he confirmed that the writer's room has been in full swing since the beginning of 2025. Which Shepard they would go with was likely one of the earliest decisions they made, so unless they restart the process, if fans are correct in their speculation for these casting calls, then we are locked in to the series featuring Male Shepard.</p>



<p>How that'll go over with fans remains to be seen, since there are plenty within the community who look to FemShep as the canon choice. The other side to this is that deciding which Shepard it'll be is only one of the many decisions that Casey and Jung will have to make that could alienate fans from the series. Which former BioWare lead writer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-show-criticized-bioware-lead-writer-david-gaider/">David Gaider, predicted would happen three years ago</a>.</p>



<p>In fairness, Gaider didn't need any prescient abilities to point out that some fans will dislike the decisions made for the coming adaptation, but as we learn more about the adaptation, it'll be interesting to see if by the time we're closing in on its premiere date, if it is starting on its back foot, needing to win over fans instead of successfully getting them excited for what's to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Borderlands 4 developer Gearbox Software has officially <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1968451501803651131">communicated</a> with the community for the first time since launch. To start with, the studio thanked all those millions who purchased the games, indirectly confirming Alinea Analytics' report that <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4 has already sold (at least) two million units</a> (and earned at least $150 million in revenue). Players have already looted 764 million items, driven 65 million kilometers, and beaten 55 million bosses, failing 7 million times.</p>



<p>The message then moved to address the main outstanding issues, such as performance and crashes, especially on PC. This is Gearbox's current top priority.</p>



<p><em>We're reading every piece of feedback you share. Some of the things we've already begun to take action on are: </em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming this Thursday. This is our top priority.</em></li>



<li><em>A Field of View (FOV) slider option for consoles is in testing right now and more information is coming very soon on that. Some console players have reported concerns with performance and we're investigating those with planned updates coming.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Users have pointed out that this somewhat contradicts the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">counterclaims of Gearbox president and CEO Randy Pitchford regarding performance in Borderlands 4</a>. Regardless, the studio as a whole has now declared its commitment to delivering 'an incredible experience'. Launch is just the beginning for the game, with two Story Packs and four Bounty Packs <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-endgame-post-launch-roadmap-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already planned for the next year</a>, in addition to several free updates. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Gearbox has shared a new SHiFT code that will provide access to the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 new Vault Hunter Skin usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li>



<li>1 Legendary Ripper Shield, which scales to your Vault Hunter's level (with a minimum of Lvl 25) when you redeem it via the Reward Center section of your Inventory screen, under Equipment.</li>



<li>2 ECHO-4 Drone Skins: "Break Free" and "Kn0x"</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has just released Dying Light: The Beast, the third installment (fourth if you count the original game's expansion pack The Following) in the first-person open world action game zombie series.</p>



<p>You can read our full game review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, written by David Carcasole. Here's an excerpt:</p>



<p><em>Dying Light: The Beast has two core pillars that are fairly strong, and if you are already a fan of the series, then there's sure to be plenty here for you to enjoy, even if it might not knock it out of the park in every element. If you're new to the series and have no prior attachments to it, but love a good zombie-killing game now and then, I'd push you to really consider how much you want to spend your money on this game, when there are so many better games to spend your time with in 2025.</em></p>



<p>In this article, I will concentrate exclusively on the game's technical side. The game utilizes an evolved version of Techland's proprietary C-Engine, last seen in Dying Light 2: Stay Human. As a reminder, Dying Light: The Beast was originally going to be the second DLC for Stay Human, and to be honest, it shows, at least visually.</p>



<p>Even though the development team stressed that there have been a number of significant technical improvements in the game to lighting, weather effects, skyboxes, materials, and foliage, to be honest, the game doesn't look that different. Furthermore, it looks pretty average for a 2025 triple-A game, even with all settings maxed out on PC. The texture work and lighting in particular stand out negatively when compared to top games in the genre. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast 4K PC Gameplay - Max Settings, DLAA, DLSS FGx4 with RTX 5090" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECwhcscNyt0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Visuals could perhaps slightly improve post-launch. Techland had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-pc-requirements-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4-intel-xess-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that Dying Light: The Beast would include ray-traced global illumination and reflections, but these are nowhere to be seen in the graphics options. We reached out to ask about their inclusion, but have not received a response so far. It is possible they might be coming later with a patch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The flip side is that the game doesn't even perform that well as is, and that is on top-of-the-line hardware. With a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and GeForce RTX 5090, the game averaged 236.2 frames per second with maxed settings at 4K resolution, DLSS Multi Frame Generation (x4), and DLAA. But there is a lot of variance; the 1% Low is at 129 FPS, and the 0.1% Low is at 85 FPS. What's worse, if you check the gameplay video, some stutters go down to 40-45 FPS, and in two instances (toward the end of the footage) even down to 9 or 20 FPS. Needless to say, it feels all the more jarring coming (and quickly returning to) from a very high average frame rate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Obviously, the side effects of this stuttering can be minimized, as always, by capping your frame rate. But doing so would effectively negate the benefit of having a display with a high refresh rate. It's a trade-off that might be worth it on a case-by-case basis and one that each user will ultimately have to decide for themselves.</p>



<p>One clear improvement over Dying Light 2: Stay Human is that Techland has introduced native support for HDR (High Dynamic Range) displays in this new game. The HDR calibration is well-made, offering detailed sliders for Maximum Luminance, Minimum Luminance, Brightness, Shadows, and UI Brightness. I would definitely recommend turning on HDR if you have the chance, as it can help combat the otherwise bland color palette available in regular SDR.</p>



<p>Overall, though, it is clear to me that Techland will have to significantly step up the technical game with their next title if they want to keep up with the ever-improving visual standard. Part of the reason for the middling visuals can be attributed to having to cater to legacy platforms like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, at a time when practically every triple-A game save for annual sports titles has dropped those aging consoles. Indeed, Techland should rather look forward. Given the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-wants-to-switch-to-a-3-4-year-cycle-starting-with-dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated goal to create games every three years or so</a>, its next game could very well arrive alongside the next-generation consoles (such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a>), which will undoubtedly feature some impressive launch titles against which the next Dying Light installment would inevitably be compared.</p>
