			<p>Fable, the next entry in the series in development by Playground Games, may be a multiplatform release right from launch, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Spanish website<a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350777664/starfield-fable-y-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-llegaran-a-playstation-5-y-switch-2-segun-nuestras-fuentes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Vandal</a>, which previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-big-steam-deck-new-joy-cons/">proved</a> to be somewhat reliable, shared in a new report today that work on the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 versions of Fable has already begun, and the game could release on the two systems at the same time as it lands on PC and Xbox Series X and S.</p>
<p>In addition to revealing that Fable is already in the works for other systems, the new report also revealed that Killer Instinct and Starfield are among the closest former Xbox exclusives to release on other platforms. The PlayStation 5 version of Bethesda's latest RPG has been in the works since its launch in late 2023.</p>
<p>While the news of Fable being a multiplatform release right from launch must be taken with a grain of salt, there's a good chance of it happening, considering Microsoft's new strategy, and some recent statements from Phil Spencer, who said outright that <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/">keeping their games off other platforms is not the path for the publisher</a>. In addition, Microsoft's new multiplatform strategy has started to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-top-publisher-december-2024/">bear fruit</a>, so it really wouldn't be surprising for the publisher to double down on it, and release some of its most anticipated games on other platforms right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Fable is currently scheduled for a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/">2025 release</a>, so it shouldn't take much longer to learn more about it, including its rumored multiplatform launch. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 will take place roughly 70 years after the previous installment, when megacorporation Horzine has created the ultimate army: a docile horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. The only thing standing between them and mankind is the rogue group known as Nightfall. The game puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, who'll then team up with up to five teammates. Smarter AI, dynamic environments, new and fully customizable weapons, and even more realistic dismemberment are the signature features promised by Tripwire.</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Closed Beta Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RCHPgFjXXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If having to wait two months sounds too long, you could try <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/#signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing up</a> for the Closed Beta that will take place between February 20 and 24. As a side note, the game's release window s<a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hared in May 2024</a> by Embracer Group has been respected. We'll see if that's the case for two other games published by Embracer, Titan Quest II and Gothic Remake, both of which were also slated to launch by March.</p>

<p>Since its release last week, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has seen a lot of attention from the modding community, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few mods</a> have already been released to address some of the game's most glaring issues and allow players to do something that is not possible in the vanilla game, such as adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-addresses-pop-in-playable-sephiroth-zack/">Sephiroth and Zack to the party</a>. The two characters work reasonably well in combat, but what is possible to do with them is extremely limited at the moment, as no one has currently figured out how to change their equipment and Materia.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod.1096788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly two years since PureDark started <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-tes-v-skyrim-is-out-now-alpha-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing</a> his DLSS Frame Generation mods with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. While the regular DLSS mod is available for free, the Frame Generation one was locked to his Patreon subscribers.</p>
<p>At last, the Community Shaders team has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a free version of DLSS FG for Skyrim. This is based on the NVIDIA Streamline plugin; however, due to a long-standing DX11 bug that exists for DLSS FG and Reflex, NVIDIA's technology isn't actually lowering the latency. According to the CS team, this isn't a big issue if your frame rate is already running over 60 frames per second, though, of course, they still hope NVIDIA will eventually fix that bug.</p>
<p>There are a few more caveats. The mod does not support Skyrim VR (you've got space warp there, which they say is even better), is not compatible with the SSE ReShade Helper mod, and also isn't fully compatible with ReShade itself. From the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>Effects will run twice as slow, and depth effects are not supported. Basic effects are fine.</em></p>
<p>To ensure that everything is working as intended, you'll need to set the frame rate limit via SSE Display Tweaks (which is also a requirement) to half your refresh rate (rounded down).</p>
<p>The Community Shaders team acknowledged the sudden release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-adds-smooth-motion-a-driver-based-frame-generation-ai-model-for-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Smooth Motion</a> as a potential better way to add frame generation for the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards; however, this mod remains useful for GeForce RTX 40 Series owners.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Community Shaders suite was recently updated with some major graphics enhancements for Skyrim, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Physically Based Rendering (PBR)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic cloud shadows and skylighting</a>, just to name a few. There's more on the way, too, including a fix to unlock the amount of draw calls so that more of these graphics features can be enabled at once without crashes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry tech seems to bring significant performance and VRAM usage improvements even on previous generation RTX GPUs, as highlighted by a new Alan Wake 2 comparison video.</p>
<p>The video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Compusemble">Compusemble</a> puts the survival-horror game developed by Remedy running on an RTX 4090 GPU at 4K resolution with DLAA and DLSS Quality, high path tracing, and maxed-out settings running side-by-side with and without RTX Mega Geometry, which was introduced to the game with updated 1.2.8, highlighting how the new NVIDIA tech brings an average 13% improvement and a significant reduction in VRAM usage. Considering the RTX 40 series lacks the 4th generation ray tracing cores designed for RTX Mega Geometry featured in the RTX 50 series cards, the results should be even better on the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/">RTX 5090</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-suprim-soc-16-gb-gpu-review-superior-cooling-stunning-looks/">5080</a> GPUs and the upcoming rest of the lineup that will launch in the coming months.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 - First RTX Mega Geometry On vs Off Performance Comparison!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lxg6TRvn70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The RTX Mega Geometry tech seen in action in Alan Wake 2 above is only one of the new technologies that launched together with the RTX 50 series cards. Among them is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, which is capable of generating more frames than the regular DLSS Frame Generation tech. NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution is also seeing a massive improvement with the introduction of a Transformer model which improves <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-super-resolution-performance-better-dlss-3-8-quality/">image quality and detail</a> considerably over the previous CNN model. Except for Multi Frame Generation, all the tech above is compatible with all RTX GPUs.</p>

			<p>A Dark Souls 3 official remaster isn't getting developed anytime soon, but from today, PC players can enjoy playing the third entry in the series by FromSoftware with some amazing visual improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster.</p>
<p>The Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1849?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, has been developed by fromsoftserve, the same modder behind the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, and packs many of the same visual improvements, which include modified reflectance maps to fix an overly metallic look, improved SSAO, improved pointlights, dynamic shadows, removed hero lights from the player and enemies, introduces TAA via Reshade while disabling in-game AA and more. Also, these improvements are only the beginning, as the modder has plans to upscale all textures and add parallax occlusion mapping to more surfaces in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul is out now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzl0coaV3cc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before releasing the Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul mod and the release announcement video above, fromsoftserve also shared a lengthy video detailing the process of improving the game's visuals and how the work on the Bloodborne Remaster Project helped. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the third and, for now, final entry in the series by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-iii-review/">review.</a></p>
