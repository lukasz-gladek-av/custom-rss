			<p>The original PlayStation console launched in North America on September 9, 1995, making today, September 9, 2025, the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> of the platform in this part of the world. PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/announcing-playstation-30th-memories/">announced</a> a 'Memories' campaign as part of its 30th anniversary celebrations, but a more interesting tidbit about PlayStation's history came from Circana executive director, Mat Piscatella, who revealed that, per Circana's extensive sales tracking data, almost half of the best-selling games on PlayStation consoles for the entire platform's history are Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u">posted</a> the sales chart as his own 'happy birthday' to the PlayStation platform, revealing the top-20 best-selling games on PlayStation devices in the United States for the past 30 years as of July 2025 by both dollar sales and units sold. </p>



<p>If we're looking at dollar sales, then 11 out of the top 20 best-selling games on PlayStation in the US are Call of Duty games. If we're looking at units sold, then Call of Duty games take up nine spots out of the top 20.</p>







<p>Interestingly, on the dollar sales side of the chart, the only first-party, PlayStation Studios titles to make the list are Insomniac's games from the last seven years: Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. On the units sold side of the chart, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Marvel's Spider-Man once again make the list, with Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and Sony Santa Monica's God of War (2018) being the only other first-party games.</p>



<p>Another interesting entry on the list is Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock making the dollar sales side of the chart in the number 10 spot. Guitar Hero was extremely popular in its day, though surely it's the added cost of having to buy the plastic guitar controller that boosts it to its place on the list.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the top spot for both dollar sales and units sold is occupied by none other than Grand Theft Auto V. For units sold, Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) make up the rest of the top five for units sold.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022), and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 make up the rest of the top five on the dollar sales side of the chart.</p>



<p>This chart is a clear example of how popular the Call of Duty series is in the United States, and that despite series like The Last of Us, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man being such key components of PlayStation's identity, they are unable to make a dent in the kinds of numbers that Call of Duty is able to pull, year after year. </p>

			<p>Ironwood Studios has announced the first major DLC expansion for Pacific Drive, titled Whispers in the Woods, and it'll launch sometime later in 2025.</p>



<p>The studio revealed the expansion earlier today as the climax of a live stream it started days before, teasing players with a countdown. At the end of the countdown today at 12pm ET, the trailer below debuted.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside its debut, a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/pacific-drive-expansion-whispers-in-the-woods-launches-this-year/">PlayStation Blog</a> post went live revealing more details about the expansion, which takes players on a new journey into the Olympic Exclusion Zone that can be accessed alongside the game's main campaign. </p>



<p>Whispers in the Woods "<em>explores the rise of a terrifying group of anomaly obsessed fanatics hidden deep within the depths of the forests</em>," per the blog post and Blake Dove, communications and marketing specialist at Ironwood Studios.</p>



<p>"<em>From the very beginning, we knew we wanted to take the mysteries of the Olympic Exclusion Zone in a new direction for this Expansion</em>," added Cassandra Dracott, Ironwood Studios' creative director. "<em>We had heard so much feedback and so many stories about the fear people had experienced in Pacific Drive and in With Whispers in the Woods, we knew we wanted to lean hard in that direction.</em>"</p>



<p>There's a new narrative for players to explore that's entirely voiced, you'll also be finding and collecting new artifacts, and there will be new anomalies for you to face in the OEZ. The artifacts "<em>are the expansion’s gameplay centerpiece</em>," according to Dove. </p>



<p>"<em>Inspired by our quirk system, each Artifact is imbued with a condition and an effect said condition creates. Perhaps every time you jump, your car horn honks. Maybe when your car horn honks it also takes damage. While some may grant you strange advantages, others will add twists and turns to how you play. Artifacts can even play off of each other to create chain reactions</em>."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what artifacts add to the gameplay, and what secrets of the OEZ can be uncovered in the expansion. "<em>We see this release as both for our longtime players and a welcome sign for newcomers</em>," says Dracott. "<em>If you’ve been driving through the Zone since day one, Whispers in the Woods is going to add a brand new, more terrifying take on the Olympic Exclusion Zone. And if you’re just starting out, this expansion marks the best version of the game to date with new systems and content to find and explore.</em>" </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie debuted the first major look at Destiny 2's coming Star Wars-inspired expansion, Renegades, today during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwlUS_JcarQ">a live stream event</a>. It also unveiled and launched the latest update for Destiny 2, Ash &amp; Iron, which is the first major update to the game's current Year of Prophecy.</p>



<p>Renegades was first unveiled earlier this year when Bungie hosted a live stream event for <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest Destiny 2 expansion that released this past July. Renegades is still planned for release later this year on December 2, but ahead of that launch, we got our first look at gameplay for Renegades, and just how closely it looks to Star Wars, complete with lightsabers, Imperial-style walkers, Star Wars-sounding blasters, and X-Wing fighters.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny 2 ViDoc | Infiltrating The Lawless Frontier" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuJXqw4xgCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In Renegades, players will delve into 'The Lawless Frontier,' which will include a series of high-risk, high-reward contracts that'll have players undertake smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage missions that can be completed solo or with a full squad.</p>



<p>The missions will take you to one of three planets across six maps that all have a Destiny foundation with a new Star Wars coat of paint to them. It's all part of how Bungie is weaving Star Wars through Destiny in this expansion.</p>



<p>Besides the new Lucasfilm digs coming in Renegades, Bungie also launched the Ash &amp; Iron update today, which has Guardians travelling back to the Plaguelands for the first time since the original Destiny game.</p>



<p>There's a new three-person fireteam activity to complete, and the rewards pass for Edge of Fate has been given a refresh along with today's update. A new raid will also be added on September 27, with the epic raid for The Desert Perpetual going live.</p>



<p>In other Bungie news, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">Pete Parsons</a>, the now former studio head, left the company and went into retirement after 23 years with the studio. He wasn't studio head for that whole time, but he has been the studio head for all of Bungie's recent woes in the last decade, since he took the role in 2015.</p>
