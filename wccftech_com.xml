			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy XVI</a> took almost two years to launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but it seems like the long wait was well worth it, judging by the quality of the port.</p>
<p>New videos shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheXboxTester" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Xbox Tester</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FuzionXboxTesting"> Fuzion Xbox Testing</a> provide a quick look at the Xbox Series X|S ports of the latest main entry in the long-running JRPG series by Square Enix, highlighting how the Xbox Series X version of the game is comparable to the PlayStation 5 version in pretty much every way, delivering the same image quality and performance in the two available display modes. Sadly, Square Enix did not take advantage of the late port to update AMD FSR from the old version used in the PlayStation 5 release, but that was expected.</p>

<p>While Final Fantasy XVI running on Xbox Series X as it does on PlayStation 5 is not really surprising, considering how similar the two systems are, seeing the game run on Xbox Series S is way more interesting. Despite some predictable limitations, such as lower resolution output and 30 FPS lock for its single display mode, the game seems to run rather well, keeping the framerate locked to 30 FPS consistently. Seeing how even on PlayStation 5 the game often drops way below 60 FPS in many scenarios in Performance Mode, it's undeniable that seeing Final Fantasy XVI run well on Xbox Series S, everything considered.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game's launch on Xbox consoles will be followed soon by the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade.</p>

			<p>Hollow Knight Silksong continues to be one of the most anticipated indie games because, in the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c"> six years since its first reveal</a>, it's still not out.</p>
<p>But it will be out this year, according to developer Team Cherry. We've known that the studio has been targeting a 2025 release date, partly because there will be a playable version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">in an Australian museum this coming September</a>. However, following the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 event and the reveal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, Team Cherry has made a new statement confirming that Silksong will indeed arrive this year.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally reveal had Hollow Knight fans confused, as the reveal for the new handheld almost exclusively showcased Hollow Knight Silksong gameplay, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M3QwLBrg8g&amp;t=2370s">Xbox president Sarah Bond followed up by saying,</a> "<em>The highly anticipated Hollow Knight Silksong will be available at launch, and in Game Pass, when the Ally releases later this year</em>."</p>
<p>Fans were quick to jump on that, and presumed that once we have a release date for the ROG Xbox Ally, we'll have our Silksong release date. That's not exactly the case, though, as Team Cherry's Matthew Griffon took to the studio's official Discord server (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-is-coming-this-year-following-xbox-games-showcase">Eurogamer</a>) to clarify that Silksong's release is not tied to the launch of any device, but the game will arrive this year, before the holiday season.</p>
<p>"<em>I confirmed before holiday,</em>" Griffon wrote. "<em>We are not tied to a console release</em>."</p>
<p>That means we'll have a release date at some point between now and the end of the year. Which is about as vague as the release date for Silksong has always been, but at least this time, it really feels like we're closing in on the game being ready for prime time. Hopefully, by Gamescom 2025, we'll have a specific release date publicly announced.</p>
