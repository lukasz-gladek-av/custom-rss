<p>The open-world game by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Rockstar</strong> has <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">already been delayed twice</a></strong>, and while it is reportedly <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not yet content complete</strong>, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fall 2026 release window</strong> - specifically the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">November 19, 2026 release date</strong> - is more real than the Fall 2025 window, according to a reputable <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking during the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EANk4uOn68ddip6pKliqY?si=zn4dBqixRVCBcuh4t0NBYg%0A&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=97d1ebf012ea4933"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">latest episode of the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Button Mash</em> podcast</strong></a>, the known journalist commented on the current state of the game, saying: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"The last I've heard, it was still not content complete. They're still finishing things up, finalizing levels, missions, seeing what's going to make it into the game. They're still making stuff and will hopefully be done with that soon</em></strong>."</p>



<p>Commenting on the current <strong>November 19 release date</strong> for <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong>, Schreier said: <strong><em>"It’s really hard to say right now, and I don’t think anyone at Rockstar can tell you with 100% certainty that they will make it out in November."</em></strong> However, it is too early to panic as Schreier thinks <em><strong>"this [November 2026 release] feels a little bit more real than Fall 2025 did."</strong> </em></p>



<p>Still, even if the game were to receive another delay, it could be a small one of a few months as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Take-Two</strong> would still want to hit its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">financial targets</strong> for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fiscal year ending on March 31, 2027</strong>, giving <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Rockstar Games</strong> a little more time to release the game.</p>



<p>As expected, a part of the <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> community entered <strong>"Panic Mode"</strong> upon learning that the game might not be content-complete yet, anticipating an almost certain delay. However, <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> himself posted a pointed clarification based on the pattern for previous games: <strong><em>"Yes, directly after saying that with Red Dead 2 they delayed it twice and I wouldn't be shocked if that's the same pattern, and directly before saying that while with game development you can never be 100% certain, this feels more solid than previous dates did."</em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-sort-of-content-then-is-already-in-grand-theft-auto-vi"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">What Sort of</strong><strong> </strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Content, Then, Is Already In Grand Theft Auto VI?</strong></h2>



<p>While knowing that <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> is not yet content complete doesn't tell us a whole lot, knowing what's already been implemented in the game would definitely make fans even more excited.</p>



<p>As of now, very little is currently known about the game, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">two trailers</a></strong> released to date have not shown a lot in terms of gameplay. However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q72olz/gta6_gamerolls_leak_basically_confirmed/"><strong>the recent firing of Rockstar Games employees</strong></a> due to their supposed leaking of information regarding the game has essentially confirmed an older list of leaked information shared by <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_"><strong><em>GameRoll</em></strong>.</a></p>



<p><strong>Among the leaked features that will supposedly be in Grand Theft Auto VI are:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A six-star wanted system</strong>,</li>



<li><strong>A relationship bar</strong> that works like the <strong>honor system</strong> in <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></li>



<li><strong>Weight mechanics</strong></li>



<li><strong>Underwater exploration</strong></li>



<li><strong>Greeting and antagonizing NPCs</strong></li>



<li><strong>A Dual Protagonist system</strong> that allows players to control both <strong>Jason and Lucia</strong> at the same time</li>



<li><strong>A Dead-Eye-like ability for Jason</strong> that slows down time to reveal enemy's weak spots (which devs reportedly don't feel too keen on at the time of the leak)</li>



<li><strong>NPCs reacting to characters holding weapons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gore and dismemberment systems</strong> based on <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2's</em></strong> systems</li>



<li><strong>Limited weapon system</strong></li>



<li><strong>Male strippers</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>With the timeline of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Rockstar Games' employees firing</strong> lining up almost perfectly, another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong> leak posted a few months back on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q775cn/potential_gta_6_plot_leak/"><strong>Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</strong></a> is also gaining some traction, revealing details on the game's plot and some mechanics, including a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"new mechanic for detecting threats and valuable items around you,"</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"very detailed mechanics of searching places,"</strong> inspired by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Although these leaks should still be taken with a massive grain of salt, it's undeniable that they paint an exciting picture, complemented by the many <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-patents-revolutionize-open-world-forever/">patents filed by Rockstar Games over the years</a></strong> and the opinion of experts which believe the game could even <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/">evolve int</a></strong><strong><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/">o</a></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/"> an MMO with some of its mechanics.</a></strong></p>



<p>Even if just a fraction of these features and mechanics make it into <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></strong>, the next entry in the series will be a <strong>massive step forward</strong> compared to both its predecessor and <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong>, which continues to be one of the best open-world games ever made also thanks to technology advancements such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/"><strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong>.</a></p>

			<p>The rumor smoke surrounding <strong>the third The Witcher 3 DLC</strong> gets even larger today, as two prominent Polish websites confirm <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous report from the analyst firm <strong>Noble Securities</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, <strong>IGN Poland</strong> <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?fbclid=IwY2xjawPKJn1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote an article about this</a>, revealing that they have known about the potential new expansion for 'a very long time'. They didn't report anything until now because, albeit credible, the information only came to them from a singular source. </p>



<p>Anyway, they have now revealed that, at least back then, they heard <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> was looking into expanding the game toward a brand new region: the desert of <strong>Zerrikania</strong>. This would provide a much-needed contrast with the existing regions of <strong>Velen</strong>, located in northern <strong>Temeria</strong> and featured in the base game, and <strong>Toussaint</strong>, the small autonomous duchy added with the second The Witcher 3 DLC, <strong>Blood and Wine</strong>. However, IGN Poland concedes that things may have changed since they first got a hold of the rumor, and as such, the addition of <strong>Kovir and Poviss</strong> is also possible, especially as it would set the stage for the upcoming <strong>The Witcher IV</strong> game, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't launch until at least <strong>2027</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Today, the Polish website <strong>PPE</strong> also <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/395072/trzeci-dodatek-do-wiedzmina-3-rozegra-sie-w-zerrikanii-ujawniono-mase-konkretnych-szczegolow.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared another confirmation that a new DLC is indeed on the way</a>:</p>



<p><em>We, at PPE, can also confirm these revelations – we heard about the new Wild Hunt project from our sources a year ago. We were clearly told in the first half of 2025 that The Witcher 3 would receive new, major content "that we will love."</em></p>



<p>As the saying goes, where there's too much smoke, there's also likely to be fire. Before these reports, nobody expected the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-celebrates-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ten-year-old masterpiece</a> to receive new content so late, given that CD Projekt RED was very busy working on the new installment. They must have partnered with another developer to offload most of the work, as according to the studio's latest report, only 22 employees were working on 'other', unspecified projects, while everyone else was doing something other than a new The Witcher 3 DLC.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G6sZHd-XwAAhDiX-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>One potential partner is <strong>Fool's Theory</strong>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already working with CD Projekt RED</a> on the <strong>remake of the first The Witcher</strong>, though this is just speculation. Anyway, if there really is a third The Witcher 3 DLC coming this year, an official announcement may not be so far away. Until then, stay tuned to hear the latest rumors and leaks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sea of Remnants, NetEase’s ‘Ocean-Fantasy’ Open World RPG, Reveals New Gameplay and Sets February Test]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sea-of-remnants-open-world-rpg-reveals-new-gameplay-sets-february-test/</link>
            <guid>1400221</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher <strong>NetEase</strong> and developer <strong>Joker Studio</strong> (previously known for the F2P asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game <strong>Identity V</strong>) unveiled a six-minute gameplay video of <strong>Sea of Remnants</strong>, the 'ocean-fantasy' open world RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-remnants-is-an-f2p-ocean-adventure-rpg-coming-next-year-to-pc-ps5-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in June</a> during that month's <strong>State of Play</strong>.</p>



<p>The new footage also came with the announcement of the '<strong>Wanderer Test</strong>', a small-scale Closed Alpha test that will run from <strong>February 5 to 12</strong> on PC. From today until <strong>January 23</strong>, players can apply for the test by following the <a href="https://x.com/seaofremnants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Sea of Remnants X account</a>, engaging with the trailer post, or joining the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vtbh6WE9DS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Sea of Remnants Discord</a> and completing the application questionnaire. Questionnaires will also be available on platforms including Steam and Reddit. Places to participate in the test are extremely limited, according to the developers, and eligible captains will be notified if they are selected to receive test access.</p>



<p>The press release ends with the confirmation that the game will debut later this year on <strong>PC</strong> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via <strong>Steam</strong></a>) and <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>. The previous news also mentioned mobile, which is, however, missing now. Perhaps it's simply that it will arrive later than the main versions.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wave! — Sea of Remnants &quot;Wanderer Test&quot; Gameplay Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crOhExboz5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Anyway, Sea of Remnants aims to blend simulation, survival-building, and turn-based strategy. <strong>You play an amnesiac puppetfolk sailor</strong> navigating the sea toward a cursed, mysterious realm rumored to grant riches at the cost of memories.</p>



<p>The game features <strong>over three hundred recruitable NPCs</strong> across rival factions, whose allegiances shift based on your choices, reshaping the pirate hub city of <strong>Orbtopia</strong> dynamically. You'll recruit specialized crews, upgrade modular ship components, and engage in <strong>strategic turn-based land combat</strong> with mechanics like Reinforcement Points (dice rolls determining damage scaling) and a Posture gauge system, alongside real-time naval combat with responsive controls.</p>



<p>Open-world exploration takes place across volcanic islands, lush rainforests, and eerie ruins, while the progression is anchored to Orbtopia, where you can craft, cook, fish, play mahjong, train hidden professions, and run NPC-partnered shops. The experience <strong>incorporates roguelike elements</strong>: death or sinking results in the loss of non-waterproofed loot, although couriers allow for safe material transfers. The player's decisions are also said to ripple across faction dynamics and story outcomes, <strong>ensuring divergent experiences across playthroughs</strong>.</p>
