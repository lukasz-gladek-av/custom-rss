			<p>It's been a couple of years since Crate Entertainment announced Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn, a new expansion coming to the hack-and-slash action RPG. Back then, the US-based studio estimated a launch in 2024, which clearly didn't happen.</p>
<p>Now, the developers have <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/fangs-of-asterkarn-development-update-june-2025/146114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a new progress update. The game has a chance of launching late this year, but Crate admitted it could be delayed to Spring or even early Summer 2026. In their partial defense, the developers noted that Grim Dawn: Fangs of Asterkarn will be by far the biggest expansion for the game, dwarfing <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-ashes-of-malmouth-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashes of Malmouth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-forgotten-gods-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forgotten Gods</a>:</p>
<p><em>To put things in perspective, by our current estimations, Fangs of Asterkarn will cover approximately 3.55sq. km, which makes it roughly 110% as big as Ashes of Malmouth. Kurnhold, the de-facto capital of the Kurn and the new quest hub, spans 4 zones, compared to the 1.5 that the Covenant of the Three took up in Forgotten Gods.</em></p>
<p><em>In all that world, there are, as of this writing, currently 47 main/side quests, and that number will likely continue to grow as we flesh out the content. Scattered across Asterkarn are 54 new bosses, including 8 new Nemesis encounters. Mechanically, these bosses will feature some of the most advanced skill tech Grim Dawn has had yet as we continue to push this aging engine to its absolute limits. If you have been keeping up with our updates, then you are already aware of the first superboss, the Dread, but another awaits you…somewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>From these bosses, and their minions, you will be looting over 380 new Unique items and 120 Monster Infrequents. This is not including Awakened Epic items, which is a list we are still working on and expect to grow post release, or Ascended common drops in Ascendant mode, which have 33 unique tertiary affixes found nowhere else in the game. All this is not even including the two roguelike dungeons we have planned post-release, which will expand the world and add another two rounds of new bosses and unique loot drops.</em></p>

The team <a href="https://wccftech.com/grim-dawn-definitive-edition-xbox-release-date-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Grim Dawn Definitive Edition for Xbox One in December 2021, including both Ashes of Malmouth and Forgotten Gods.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-new-trailer-45-minute-livestream-set-for-june-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco Entertainment have released a lengthy gameplay overview for the action RPG The Blood of Dawnwalker in which the studio's CD Projekt roots were very clear. Gamers were shown combat both as a human and as a vampire, as well as the different approaches to quests depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>The footage was captured on PC from the game's latest pre-beta build without any additional post-capture cleanup. It already looks very good, though. After fighting some bandits, protagonist Coen enters the region’s largest city, Svartrau, showing a bustling town fairly reminiscent of Novigrad from The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p>One of the key features of The Blood of Dawnwalker is the stark contrast between day and night: bustling medieval life masks the influence of a vampire regime during the day, while moonlit rooftops reveal hidden secrets at night. Moreover, as a Dawnwalker, Coen is neither fully human nor entirely vampire. During the day, he can wield a sword and use magical runes in the form of bloody scars etched onto his skin, although this kind of magic comes at a cost: it siphons off a portion of Coen's health.</p>
<p>During the night, Coen embraces his supernatural instincts and unlocks an entirely new set of powers. His nocturnal abilities include lethal vampiric claws and Shadowstep, a skill that allows him to navigate across rooftops swiftly. At nighttime, Coen must also constantly grapple with his relentless bloodlust. During gameplay, visual cues help players to assist Coen in satisfying his hunger in various ways, such as drinking the blood of foes (including vampires, innocent villagers, and animals) or using special blood vials.</p>
<p>If he remains unsatisfied, not only will this craving weaken his abilities and vitality, but it may also cause him to lose control in critical moments and unintentionally kill an important character in the story. This wouldn't be the end of the game, though; one of the core tenets laid out by Rebel Wolves is that of the narrative sandbox, where there is no difference between main and side quests, and each consequence of the player's actions will simply push the story forward, albeit in a different direction.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1XOa0JYJv8g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Polish developers also revealed that The Blood of the Dawnwalker uses a For Honor-like directional combat system (albeit with four directions) designed to bring cinematic intensity and tactical challenge to every confrontation. Players must study enemy movements, block precisely, and time their counterattacks well to perform seamless, strategic takedowns.</p>
<p>The overview ends with Coen's confrontation with one of the vampire bosses, Xanthe, which ends badly for the player character. Rebel Wolves noted that players can take on the bosses, even the final one, relatively early on if they so choose, but they will be extremely challenging. The game runs on a sort of timer because Coen has only 30 days to save his family, although the developers said it's more like a resource than an actual countdown.</p>
<p>Lastly, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco confirmed that The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
