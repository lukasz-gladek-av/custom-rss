			<p>EA Sports FC 26 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">due out at the end of the week</a> at the time of this writing, and its incoming arrival had former professional footballer Wayne Rooney talking on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0lwvsnc">his 'The Wayne Rooney Show' podcast</a> about the series and his experiences with EA's football series and videogames in general, which came with an interesting revelation. Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-big-part-of-our-success-was-playing-the-psp-wayne-rooney-credits-sonys-handheld-for-man-uniteds-performances/">VGC</a>, Rooney credits part of the success he and his Manchester United club enjoyed during his time with the squad to game sessions he and teammates would have playing SOCOM on their PSP consoles.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Portable (PSP) featured four SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs titles: SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo, SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo 2, SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Tactical Strike, and SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Fireteam Bravo 3. All four were released over the course of Rooney's tenure with Manchester United, which lasted between 2004 and 2017, during which he and Man United won five Premier League titles, the Champions League, the Europa League, the FA Cup, four Community Shields, and three League Cups.</p>



<p>After a fun conversation about what Rooney's rating in EA Sports FC 26 is now that he's moved on to being part of the Legends roster of players, Kelly Somers asks Rooney about his own gaming history, to which he begins by saying, "<em>I used to play a lot of FIFA and Call of Duty. Of late, I've not played much obviously,</em>" say for the odd time he says he's played with YouTubers and influencers, and of course his own kids.</p>



<p>When Somers asks what else, beyond FIFA, he used to play, Rooney says, "<em>Do you know what we used to play, not FIFA. True story, this, at Man United, I really believe</em> <em>a big part of our success was playing the PSP. Honestly, it got us communicating more; we used to play on the plane, on the team bus. We'd play 5v5 on a game on called SOCOM on the PSP, army game. You have to talk, you have to tactically be right, go revive people when they got killed. It was a massive part of our success I believe. You can ask any of the players who played at the same time, it was brilliant.</em>"</p>

<p>Another example of how games can bring people together and have real-world impact on how you interact with others in your life. It's also another example of the impact of SOCOM, a series that many PlayStation fans, and likely some Manchester United fans, would love to see make a comeback.</p>

			<p>Xbox Game Pass has been a hot topic since its launch in 2017, sometimes for positive reasons, though increasingly for negative or, at the very least, mixed reasons. Through all its trials and tribulations, though, Microsoft and Xbox put itself on the Game Pass path, and have shown no signs of wanting to pivot. In fact, according to ID@Xbox, in 2025, Microsoft and Xbox are putting more behind Game Pass than ever before.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, head of Xbox's ID@Xbox program, Chris Charla, spoke about how Xbox is investing more in Game Pass in 2025 than it ever has.</p>



<p>"<em>The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service,</em>" Charla said. "<em>As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming.</em>"</p>



<p>All things considered, it's not surprising to see Microsoft continuing to double down on Xbox Game Pass. Despite numerous comments from <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/">multiple</a> former<a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/"> Xbox Studios developers</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">analyst reports</a>, and examples we've seen of just <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-spends-50k-50m-to-get-games-onto-xbox-game-pass/">how much Xbox is putting into every game it brings to the service</a>, the latest financial reports from Microsoft show that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">Xbox revenue is growing</a>. Game Pass brings in $5 billion a year, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>It may have deeper ramifications for the industry and the games on the service, as has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">been pointed out several times</a>, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a time when Microsoft was more concerned with the deeper cultural ramifications of an area of its business than how well that business was performing on its bank sheet.</p>



<p>The future of the Xbox platform has been tied to Xbox Game Pass since 2017, and at least in the near future, it doesn't look like that's going to change.</p>

			<p>Today, Embark Studios announced the release date of its third-person extraction shooter game ARC Raiders. The game will be available on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 30. To prepare for the full launch, the studio will conduct a final public test titled 'Server Slam' between Friday, October 17, and Sunday, October 19. The featured map will be Dam Battlegrounds; participants in the event will receive an exclusive Backpack cosmetic reward, unlocked at launch with a full game purchase.</p>



<p>Aleksander Grøndal, Executive Producer at Embark Studios, said:</p>



<p><em>We’re excited to welcome Raiders to the Server Slam — this is where we’ll really put ARC Raiders through its paces ahead of full launch. Our goal is simple: make sure that on October 30, when the servers go live, every player experiences the game exactly as we’ve intended — polished, balanced, and ready for action. Thanks for joining us — let's prepare to go topside.</em></p>

<p>ARC Raiders is also available for pre-order now. The Standard Edition is priced $39.99 and comes with the Lucky Duck Bundle pre-order bonus (Backpack: Hatchling, Backpack Charm: Golden Rubber Duck). The Deluxe Edition is priced $59.99 and adds an extra pre-order bonus, the Astro Bundle, which comes with a Legendary Outfit (G-Suit + color variants), a Backpack (Salvager), and a Backpack Attachment (Spaceship Souvenir). It also includes the following exclusive content:</p>



<ul>
<li>Legendary Outfit: Valente Legendary + color variants</li>



<li>Backpack: Pathfinder</li>



<li>Backpack Attachment: Blanket Roll</li>



<li>Face Cosmetic: Lip Scar</li>



<li>Skin: Cowboy Scrappy</li>



<li>Emote: Finger Gun: Rapid Fire</li>



<li>2,400 Raider Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021 as a free-to-play cooperative shooter. It was also meant to be their debut title, but the arena shooter The Finals passed it in that regard. Meanwhile, ARC Raiders was delayed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repurposed into a PvPvE extraction shooter</a>. It'll face stiff competition in a very saturated genre, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our early test</a> suggests it may just have the right cards to succeed.</p>
