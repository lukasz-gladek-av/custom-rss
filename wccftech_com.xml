			<p>We have another film adaptation of a video game to look forward to, and it's once again another <strong>PlayStation</strong> franchise to add to the list of adaptations under the belt of <strong>Sony </strong>and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong>. This time, it's <strong>Fast &amp; Furious</strong> director <strong>Justin Lin</strong> taking on an adaptation of <strong>Arrowhead Games' Helldivers</strong>, with Dune's Duncan Idaho, <strong>Jason Momoa,</strong> starring in the film.</p>



<p>The news comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/">Deadline</a>, which adds that the film will premiere next year, on <strong>November 10, 2027,</strong> with Lin's <strong>Perfect Storm Entertainment</strong> and PlayStation Productions producing the film.</p>



<p>Other adaptations, whether they're set to be a TV series or a film, like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/">HBO's The Last of Us</a></strong> or the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/uncharted-movie-is-already-a-new-hit-franchise-says-sony/">Uncharted</a> </strong>movie, are easy to imagine with regard to their plot. We didn't have to wonder what kind of story <strong>Craig Mazin</strong> would try to tell with his Last of Us show. The same goes for Uncharted, because we knew it would be another treasure-hunting romp featuring Nathan Drake.</p>



<p>The same can't be said for this upcoming Helldivers movie; Lin could take the Starship Troopers-esque world Arrowhead has built and take it in several directions. What we can at least expect is that the film will stay true to the mixture of violence and comedy that Helldivers is known for, and, considering Lin's directing background, plenty of over-the-top action.</p>



<p>Lin hasn't directed every film in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, but he has several under his belt. After directing <strong>Tokyo Drift</strong> in 2006, he directed Fast &amp; Furious in 2009,<strong> Fast Five</strong> in 2011, and <strong>Fast &amp; Furious 6</strong> in 2013. After that, he returned to the series to direct <strong>F9</strong> in 2021. With how grand the scale of action is when playing <strong>Helldivers 2</strong>, Lin seems like the perfect choice to lead a film adaptation.</p>



<p>Jason Momoa, on the other hand, is a bigger question mark. It'll be interesting to see how he slots into this film, though his work in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">The Minecraft Movie</a></strong> suggests that he's more than up for a silly, video game-inspired adventure, and that he can be part of a movie hitting some serious numbers at the box office.</p>

			<p><strong>ARC Raiders </strong>wouldn't be an extraction shooter if <strong>Embark Studios</strong> didn't have people asking you to bring stuff back from your trips <strong>Topside</strong>. That's why there are plenty of <strong>quests</strong> you'll be asked to complete for each of the traders featured.</p>



<p>Though the actual tasks these quests require you to complete are relatively simple, they're not always simple to complete. Besides avoiding other players and ARCs to make it to your destination, if you're not thorough, you run the risk of needing multiple visits Topside just to get one objective completed. </p>



<p>This guide will run you through how to complete <strong>Apollo's</strong> '<strong>The League</strong>' quest, where you help Speranza's resident gadgets and grenades expert give football back to the people surviving through this dystopian world.</p>

<p>To start the quest, you need to find two things: a <strong>football</strong> and a <strong>bicycle pump</strong>. A football, because, well, obviously, you need one to play football, and a bicycle pump because none of the footballs you would find in this futuristic wasteland would have air in them.</p>



<p>Both are <strong>Residential </strong>items that can technically be found in any residential area on any map, but your best bet is to head straight to the <strong>Water Towers</strong> in <strong>Dam Battlegrounds</strong>. You'll potentially find both a bicycle pump and a deflated football there in one go, but if you're strolling through residential areas on other maps, there's still a chance you'll find either one or both in the odd drawer. </p>



<p>Finding them isn't enough, though, as you'll need to extract back to Speranza safely for the objective to be considered complete. </p>

<p>This one is just in the name, and it's also why I advise you to look for a bicycle pump and a deflated football at the Water Towers before trying somewhere else. Once you're at the Water Towers, even if you can't find the other items, you'll be able to take the photo to complete the objective, which you can see in the screenshots above.</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, less straightforward than the previous picture-perfect challenge. Firstly, you'll need to head to <strong>Buried City</strong> to complete this objective, and you'll also need to be a bit lucky. You can find football magazines to photograph at any white kiosk building on the map, but it's not a guarantee. </p>



<p>In this case, it's possible that you run out of time looking into every kiosk, unable to find the right magazines, but just like with everything else in ARC Raiders, persistence is key. You should be able to find a kiosk with football magazines to photograph in a kiosk on the north side of <strong>Marano Station</strong>. If you can't find them there, you'll have to cross the map while keeping an eye out for every kiosk, but it shouldn't be an issue to find them at any of the Marano Station kiosks.</p>



<h3 id="h-rewards">Rewards</h3>



<p>Once you've successfully extracted both items and taken both photos, speak to Apollo to be rewarded with <strong>5 Tagging Grenades, 5</strong> <strong>Fireworks,</strong> and a <strong>Faded Flush (Aviator Colour)</strong> cosmetic. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the start of 2026, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> didn't just announce layoffs at one of its studios (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">which is how it started 2025</a>). It announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>,"</a> which included layoffs at multiple studios, the shuttering of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Ubisoft Halifax</a></strong>, the cancellation of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, and significant changes to its operating structure, alongside some unpopular new policies like a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">return-to-office mandate</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The response to these changes has not exactly been positive, both internally within Ubisoft and externally across the industry. On the stock market, the announcement of the restructure saw the company's stock price drop <strong>34%</strong>, which officially saw Ubisoft lose <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/"><strong>95% of its value</strong> in just eight years.</a> When this restructuring was followed by the introduction of a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">voluntary redundancy program</a></strong> at Ubisoft's headquarters in Paris, which aimed to cut as many as <strong>200 employees</strong>, employees decided they had had enough.</p>



<p>French union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong>, which represents several employees at Ubisoft Paris, announced plans for an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">international strike</a></strong>, calling on Ubisoft employees at branches across the globe to walk out and strike on <strong>February 10, 11, </strong>and <strong>12.</strong> Yesterday, February 10, 2026, was the first day of the strike, and according to Solidaires Informatique (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>), <strong>at least 1,200 Ubisoft employees walked out yesterday to participate in the strike.</strong></p>



<p>Most of the striking employees came from within France, with some of the striking workers also coming from the Milan branch. It's a strong show of force from Ubisoft employees, who have been calling out the company's leadership, specifically chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, as the responsible party for the studio's woes.</p>







<p>Employees are still on strike today, and will be for the remainder of the week. This is also not the only demonstration that has already happened, as former staff from the now-shuttered Halifax branch held a rally last month in response to their studio getting suddenly shut down.</p>



<p>Solidaires Informatique already hosted a smaller strike last month that it called an "<em></em><em>initial answer to the absurdity of management's decisions."</em> Solidaires Informatique representative, <strong>Marc Rutschlé</strong>, also added, "<em>At this state, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year. At the same time, the reorganization is creating a number of high-level positions with excessive salaries</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From our union's point of view, this forced reversal is a disguised redundancy plan, aimed at pushing employees outside the company. The atmosphere within the studio is particularly deplorable, with anger and despair reigning supreme. Staff representatives have witnessed several breakdowns in tears; some colleagues have made suicidal comments. If Guillemot wanted to make people miserable, he couldn't have done better</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bonfire-studios-mix-of-diablo-pubg-and-dark-souls-arkheron-will-get-a-steam-next-fest-demo-ahead-of-launch-later-this-year/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Arkheron</strong>, the interesting and ambitious blend between <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ai-first-pubg-publisher-krafton-reaches-all-time-high-2b-in-revenue/">PUBG</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-re-remastered-mod-new-version/">Dark Souls</a></strong> from <strong>Bonfire Studios</strong>, which we first <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkheron-is-an-ambitious-and-intriguing-mix-of-diablo-dark-souls-and-pubg/">got a look at last September</a>. It will have its first public playtest via the launch of a brand new demo arriving on <strong>February 20, 2026,</strong> just ahead of the first <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> of 2026, which will officially kick off three days later on February 23.</p>



<p>The news of the new demo also came along with a new trailer, where Bonfire Studios takes players through some of its plans for Arkheron as the team gets closer to launch, and some of the changes and updates players who've previously participated in the game's alpha playtest weekends will notice.</p>



<p>Introduced in the demo will be two new Eternal item sets that Bonfire will reveal just ahead of the demo's actual release, though with that also means two current sets players are already familiar with will be removed for the demo. They're not going away permanently; it's just a switch Bonfire is making for now, and since part of the fun in Arkheron is mixing and matching items and abilities to create more powerful characters, it's all part of Bonfire giving players as many options on how to play as possible.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Arkheron Returns for Next Fest and Closed Beta" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3XWBE5yCbrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The demo also arrives with a new patch for the game, version <strong>0.16,</strong> which adds a new tutorial, regional server selections, environmental updates and the ability to go back through your recent teammates if you want to keep playing with someone you randomly met through the game.</p>



<p>Once the demo goes live on February 20, players will be able to jump in 24/7 until <strong>March 2, 2026,</strong> when the demo goes offline. If Arkheron strikes you as something you want to keep playing, however, Bonfire is hosting another <strong>closed beta</strong> to help the studio further refine the game ahead of launch. The closed beta will introduce a ranked mode and will be focused on ensuring the game's competitive progression is finely tuned.</p>



<p>You will need to be sent a key to access the closed beta, so if you're enjoying Arkheron during Steam Next Fest, make sure to sign up for the closed beta to potentially participate in it.</p>
