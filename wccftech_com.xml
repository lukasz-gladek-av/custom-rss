			<p>It's been nearly nine years since the launch of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-automata-genre-bending-every-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NieR: Automata</a></strong>, the highly acclaimed action RPG developed by <strong>PlatinumGames</strong> and published by <strong>Square Enix</strong>. Fans have long been waiting for news of a sequel. Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyn1b_5bw-M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as part of a celebration for the game's latest sales milestone</a> (<strong>it has now sold 10 million units</strong> across all platforms), they at least got a teaser.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/HBmcEC-WIAAVpfS-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>It sounds like the gears are finally moving. But why did it take so long? Well, it seems like Game Director <strong>Yoko Taro</strong> and Square Enix found it hard to reach an agreement. The outspoken creative first <a href="http://wccftech.com/nier-automata-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that a NieR: Automata sequel would be something nobody would have thought about</a>; a few months later, in March 2018, Taro <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-thinks-hell-make-failures-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the belief that his next projects would not be as successful</a>, so <strong>his goal was to make as much money as he could</strong>.</p>



<p>In April 2018,  he <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/taro-if-square-enix-gives-me-money-i-will-create-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled down on his previous statement</a>, <strong>calling on Square Enix to give him money if they wanted a NieR: Automata sequel</strong>: </p>



<p><em>If Square-Enix gives me money, I will create anything. So I think let Square-Enix know and I think if Square-Enix wants it, I'll do it.</em></p>



<p>However, nothing really came of it. Sure, Yoko Taro worked on the now-defunct gacha mobile <strong>Nier Reincarnation</strong> and the small-scale RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/voice-of-cards-the-isle-dragon-roars-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars</a></strong>, but beyond that, he was pretty quiet these last few years. A few months ago, he finally broke the silence to <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-has-been-working-on-multiple-projects-they-just-kept-getting-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal</a> that he had actually worked on several projects, but <strong>most of them never even got released</strong>. He was fine with it since he got paid, though. Perhaps now Square Enix and Yoko Taro have finally reached a financial agreement, though fans remain skeptical and wonder if the publisher is truly referring to the long-awaited NieR: Automata sequel.</p>



<p>By the way, the publisher also announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139-whats-the-square-root-of-1-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139</strong></a> has sold <strong>over 2 million units to date</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve is “Clearly Not” Cooperating Fairly, Says CEO Leading £656M Lawsuit Against Steam’s 30% Cut of Game Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-is-clearly-not-cooperating-fairly-says-ceo-leading-656m-lawsuit-against-steams-30-cut-of-game-sales/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, a <strong>UK judge</strong> ruled that <strong>Valve </strong>would have to face its day in court over a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/">£656 million class-action lawsuit</a></strong> being led by <strong>Parent Zone</strong> chief executive officer, <strong>Vicki Shotbolt</strong>, over the <strong>30% cut</strong> that the company takes from all transactions on <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>It's not a dissimilar case to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/epic-v-apple/"><strong>Epic Games</strong> brought against <strong>Apple</strong></a>, as Shotbolt has called Valve's 30% cut "<em>excessive</em>" and that the company "<em></em><em>is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers</em>." In a new report from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-needs-to-cooperate-fairly-and-its-clearly-not-why-valve-is-facing-a-656m-day-in-the-uk-courts">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, Shotbolt further explained her case against Valve and Steam, adding that Valve is "<em>clearly not</em>" cooperating fairly in the video games market.</p>



<p>"<em>It's about how you use digital in positive ways, and how you unlock, enjoy, and embrace opportunity</em>," said Shotbolt. "<em>Games are such a vital part of that ecosystem. It's an important industry. It's important for young people who enjoy it and play in it. It's important for the adults who have spent an enormous amount of time socialising, playing games, and so on.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Games is a really important sector, and therefore it needs to operate fairly and not overcharge, fundamentally. Steam is a big and important platform for a big and important ecosystem – <strong>it needs to cooperate fairly, and it's clearly not.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>While Shotbolt hopes that a win will provide a more balanced industry for developers and players across the world, she also admits that elements like developers lowering their prices because Steam is no longer taking as big of a cut is not guaranteed. "<em>That is out of my control</em>," Shotbolt adds. "<em>You can put a stake in the ground and say developers should not be being charged that 30% - that it is too high and not a reasonable amount of money. What you'd hope would happen is that some developers will bring their prices down, and they'll pass that on to the consumer. I believe it will happen, because that's how markets look. But it can only happen if that price parity obligation also goes away."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Of course, it's possible that developers would get together and make greater profits from their games. But one would hope a market would respond by saying it's in my interest to cut my price now and pass that on to the customer</em>."</p>



<p>We can hope that prices will go down, but Shotbolt has to win her case first. And decreasing prices aren't the only outcome Shotbolt hopes for if she wins. The ultimate goal, it would seem, is to see Valve not dominate the market and to see developers have more than one viable option for where to sell their games.</p>



<p>"<em>If you want to develop a PC game, you want it on Steam. It's not like developers have ten options</em>," Shotbolt said. "<em>That's what makes the case, I think, so important, because Steam has had market dominance for a long, long time, and it shouldn't be exploiting that.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive">IGN</a> reveals that <strong>Microsoft's</strong> gaming division and <strong>Xbox</strong> are going through a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">major leadership shake-up</a>. <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> <strong>will retire this coming Monday, February 23, 2026</strong>, after first joining Microsoft all the way back in 1988 as an intern. He's not the only one departing: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-president-says-game-exclusives-are-antiquated/">Sarah Bond</a></strong>, current president of Xbox at Microsoft, is now the <strong>former president</strong> of Xbox at Microsoft, as she will <strong>resign</strong> from her role. Lastly, Microsoft's current president of its CoreAI division, <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, will take Spencer's place as the new chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming.</p>



<p>Back in July 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">reported on a rumour that Phil Spencer would retire</a> with the arrival of the next-generation Xbox console. That rumour was denied by Microsoft at the time, claiming that Spencer was not going to retire <strong>"<em>anytime soon</em>."</strong> At the same time, we still pointed out that Spencer was 57 at the time of the report, and that he had been with Microsoft for nearly 40 years. To say Spencer was due to retire soon was not the most prescient call to make at the time, and it seems that was indeed the case. </p>



<p>"<em>I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,</em>" said Microsoft's chief executive officer, <strong>Satya Nadella</strong>. "<em>Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s rare in life to know when a chapter is closing, but after 38&nbsp;years at Microsoft, that moment has arrived for me. I’ve made the decision to retire and begin the next chapter of my life. It’s a milestone that’s given me a chance to reflect on the incredible journey I’ve been…</p>— Phil Spencer (@XboxP3) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/2024951211129254314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Spencer, for his part, added that, "<em>Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right. I'll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.</em>"</p>



<p>Also part of this shake-up is <strong>Matt Booty</strong>, who will take over from Asha Sharma as the new chief executive officer of CoreAI at Microsoft. "<em>Looking forward, I'm excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO,</em>" said Booty. "<em>Our first conversations centred on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success</em>."</p>



<p>Sharma, for her part, began her address to Microsoft's gaming staff by saying she feels "<em>two things at once: humility and urgency</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction. I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward. Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sharma added that her first job is to "<em>understand what makes this work and protect it</em>," which doesn't exactly inspire a whole lot of confidence, and speaks to her lack of experience within the video game industry. Before she joined Microsoft in 2024, she was a vice president of product and engineering at <strong>Meta</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, her next statement was that her understanding begins with three commitments, the first of which is: "<em><strong>great games</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>"<em>Everything begins here,</em>" she adds. "<em><strong>We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything.</strong></em><strong>"</strong> It's exactly what players want to hear, and is exactly the opposite of what players once heard from Spencer in a now-infamous quote.</p>



<p>Sharma continues to say her second commitment is "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," and that the company will "<em>recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those players who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world</em>."</p>



<p>This may sound like Xbox could pivot away from its current trajectory of centring its services over its hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">but with how far along that plan is, </a>it feels unlikely for the next Xbox console to usher in the platform's return to households. </p>



<p>Lastly, her third commitment is "<em>future of play</em>," which, unsurprisingly, is where Sharma mentions how <strong>AI</strong> and monetization are continuing to evolve, but she does claim that "<em>we will not chase <strong>short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop</strong></em><strong>."</strong> Strong words that players will be sure to remember, and remind Sharma of, if we ever see something from Microsoft stray from that commitment.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the end of an era for Xbox. There's a lot that players will remember Spencer and Bond for, not all of it positive, and we're entering a new chapter for the Xbox platform and Microsoft's time in the video game industry.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the only one we haven't heard from yet is Sarah Bond, who does not have a statement included in the report, nor has she made a statement on her social media accounts.</p>
