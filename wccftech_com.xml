			<p>It's been announced today by Marvel Games and NetEase Games that a special Spring Festival event will be coming to Marvel Rivals. Since its release, this title has been widely successful, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">title already winning awards</a>. The Spring Festival will be coming to Marvel Rivals on January 23 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT, where a new limited-time game mode will be available for players to participate in.</p>
<p>This game mode is called Clash of Dancing Lions and allows players to participate in a 3v3 on a designated map to try and gain possession of the ball and get it over to the scoring zones that are on either side of the field. The first team to reach the designated score will be the winner of the Clash of Dancing Lions event.</p>
<p>By participating in the Clash of Dancing Lions event in Marvel Rivals, players will be able to get limited-time items such as the Star-Lord: Lion's Mane costume, nameplate, and spray. That is just the tip of the reward iceberg, as there is plenty more to unlock, including a Gallery Card customization event named Fortune &amp; Colors.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from the Marvel Rivals event, you can check out the Spring Festival trailer below, which showcases the Clashing Lions costumes. This includes Star-Lord: Lion's Mane, Iron Fist: Lion's Gaze, and Black Widow: Lion's Heartbeat. These costumes won't all be available to begin with, and will release over the following weeks.</p>

<p>In addition, Marvel Rivals will have a special Spider-Man 2 bundle, which comes with the Advanced Suit 2.0, nameplate, and spray, coming on January 30. This is to celebrate the launch of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC.</p>
<p>The game has received three patches thus far, with the first season well underway. Players also got to experience Season 0 when the game was first released, which had just under half of the content that Season 1 currently has. Already there are many players flying through the ranks, with the likes of <a href="https://esports.gg/news/marvel-rivals/shroud-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shroud considering creating a Marvel Rivals esports organization</a> because he likes the game so much.</p>
<p>Whether that will come to fruition anytime soon remains to be seen, but as the game continues to remain popular, it's possible that this will become a staple in the esports genre amongst giants like Overwatch 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, for example.</p>

			<p>Torn Banner Studios is starting 2025 with a bang, as the first free update of 2025 has been released, taking No More Room in Hell 2 to new, frightening heights. The co-op horror shooter game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-gets-first-early-access-update-adds-new-ending-weapons/">released last year</a> in late October in Early Access and is now getting its first free update that will be adding new gameplay features, enhancements, reworks, and bug fixes to make sure that the audience is well taken care of. Below is a montage of the latest update so you can get a glimpse into some of the gory action that you can expect from the 0.2.4 update for No More Room in Hell 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Montage - 0.2.4 Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWdOg_Q5lYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the main features of this update is the introduction of a new type of zombie, called the Firefighter Zombie. They are recognizable thanks to their firefighter uniform and their oxygen tanks, which can explode if damaged. While the explosion won't damage players, it can be used to the player's advantage to knock down other nearby zombies.</p>
<p>In addition, caliber ammunition has returned to the game, after many fans have asked for it to be revived for No More Room in Hell 2. This includes a variety of ammunition types, meaning that players will have to consider what ammo they want to carry as there is limited space. This makes gameplay more technical, as players will have to make strategic decisions to be able to fight for their survival.</p>
<p>While some new features have been added to make the game more challenging and technical, the developers have reworked the Runner zombies to make them more unpredictable when attacking the player. However, they now spawn less, as the community had asked for in their feedback. This means that their attacks and movement prove to be more of a threat, but they are less likely to appear in your session so you have ample time to deal with them amidst the ongoing chaos.</p>
<p>In addition to caliber ammunition and new zombie types being added to the game, new Responder skills have been introduced in this update. This includes "Immunity," which reduces the chance of infection by half; "Outdoor CHampion," which mitigates damage from fire, gas, water, and electricity by 30%; and "Builder," which increases stack sizes for barricade boards batteries.</p>
<p>The developers have made sure to add a ton of new content in this update, but they have also been focused on making sure to fix any bugs in the game to improve the overall stability of the game. This includes changes like accurate climbing skills, visual appearance of zombies, and infinite ammo exploits.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this update in <a href="https://www.nmrih2.com/2025/01/21/update-0-2-4-our-first-update-for-the-year-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their blog post</a>, which details all of the changes made in this new update for No More Room in Hell 2.</p>

			<p>Today, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II developer/publisher combo Warhorse Studios and PLAION have unveiled the post-launch roadmap for the upcoming first-person roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-release-date-bumped-forward-by-a-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set for February 4</a>, is just the beginning of the players' new journey with Henry of Skalitz. Throughout 2025, the developers plan to constantly release updates that include various improvements and additions.</p>
<p>The roadmap kicks off this Spring with the introduction of several free enhancements, such as a Barbers feature to customize your looks, a Hardcore Mode for those seeking a harsher challenge, and Horse Racing, where you can hone your mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises.</p>
<p>In the Summer, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will receive its first premium DLC, called Brushes with Death. In this new quest, Henry must aid an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past. He'll have to face perilous encounters to unravel a web of dangerous plots.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/KCD2-Roadmap-Image-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In the Fall season, the Legacy of the Forge DLC will dig into Henry's roots by exploring the legacy of Martin, his adoptive father. Henry will work to restore a once-famous forge and test his blacksmithing skills while uncovering forgotten stories from the past.</p>
<p>In the Winter season, the third and final premium DLC, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released. Players must enter Sedlec Monastery, where intrigue is said to run deep. Henry is tasked with a secret mission and must navigate the complex dynamics of the area, uncovering hidden truths and navigating a maze of conflicting interests.</p>

<p>The three premium DLCs are included for those who purchase the more expensive versions of the game: either Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition (which is priced $20 higher than the Standard Edition and comes with the Season Pass, the Shields of Seasons Passing that lets players customize their shields with one of four unique designs, and the full costume Gallant Huntsman’s Kit), or the Collector's Edition that adds the following physical goods for a price of $199:</p>
<ul>
<li>a statue of Henry and his trusty steed, Pebbles</li>
<li>the exclusive cloth map Alleys of Kuttenberg</li>
<li>the enamel pin set Coats of Valor</li>
<li>the iconic Letter of Hope - which Sir Hans Capon was entrusted with</li>
<li>and the King’s Rebels collectible cards set</li>
</ul>
