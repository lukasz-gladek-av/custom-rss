			<p>In what feels like the greatest period of turmoil for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/">Ubisoft</a> in the company's history, Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to be the bright spark of life that the company needs, as a new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">The Game Business</a> (backed by numbers from Europe's <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">Game Sales Data</a> firm) names it the best-selling new game in Europe in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>To clarify, Shadows is, at the time of this writing, the best-selling PC and console title in Europe of all the games released in 2025. It's not the best-selling game overall, since that marker unsurprisingly goes to last year's EA Sports FC 25, which will likely hold the title until <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/">EA Sports FC 26</a> next month. But as of right now, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands above games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-drive-another-record-year-for-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-delivered-outstanding-revenue-performance-is-a-benchmark-for-successful-remasters-says-newzoo/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, and every other major release you can think of from this year so far.</p>



<p>In fact, according to GSD figures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">Split-Fiction</a> is the only game to get close to Shadows as far as 2025 releases are concerned. The next-closest is Monster Hunter Wilds, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-early-digital-sales-toby-fox-deltarune/">Mario Kart World</a>, which is followed by Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, and Nightreign after that. Out of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe for 2025 so far, including games released last year and older, Split-Fiction, Wilds, World, Deliverance II, Oblivion Remastered, Nightreign, and Shadows are the only seven games released in 2025 to make the list.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the list not released in 2025 are <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, which is having an incredible year despite being nearly eight years old at this point, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege, which is enjoying a boost from Ubisoft revamping it with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">Rainbow Six Siege X.</a></p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top-20 best-selling games in Europe on PC and consoles according to GSD, per The Game Business: </p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 25</li>



<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Split-Fiction</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Mario Kart World</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>



<li>Star Wars Battlefront II</li>



<li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto Online</li>



<li>NBA 2K25</li>



<li>F1 25</li>



<li>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege</li>



<li>Mario Kart 8: Deluxe</li>



<li>Battlefield 1</li>
</ol>



<p>Of course, it's worth remembering that this is just what the sales charts for Europe's PC and console videogame releases look like so far. Those are the key words here, because by the end of this year, it's doubtful that Shadows will be able to hold onto that top spot for 2025 releases. Not just because EA Sports FC 26 is on the horizon, but because FC 26 is coming, and this year's new Call of Duty, and Battlefield 6, and Borderlands 4, and Ghost of Yotei, and Pokemon Legends Z-A, and The Outer Worlds 2 - and those are just some of the big autumn-to-winter-timed games we know about that have release dates.</p>



<p>We'll see what this top-20 list looks like in a few months' time. But for now, Ubisoft can enjoy its moment at the top.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over at the time of this writing, ending just hours prior to this post, and as far as we know right now, we won't get another chance to play it until it launches this coming October 10, 2025. But if you can't wait that long and want more Battlefield right now, EA has released a new update for Battlefield 2042 to help tide you over until October.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-9-2-0">Update 9.2</a> for Battlefield 2042 adds a new fan-favorite map to the 2021 release, Iwo Jima, a map that is new to the last major release in the Battlefield series, but veterans of the shooter will recognize from multiple entries, including Battlefield V, Battlefield 1942, and Battlefield 1943. You'll enter the fight from the sea with boat landings, and jump into close-quarters fighting in the bunkers and trenches with an active volcano in the background to complete the grandeur of Iwo Jima.</p>



<p>The update also includes two new weapons and vehicles for players to check out: the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle. The two new vehicles are two new fighter jets, the A10 Warthog and the SU-25TM Frogfoot.</p>

<p>Along with the new map, weapons, and vehicles, EA is also adding a free battle pass that runs right up to Battlefield 6's release, titled the Road to Battlefield Battle Pass, which includes 60 tiers of cosmetics for players to earn, celebrating previous Battlefield titles stretching all the way back to Battlefield Bad Company 2.</p>



<p>There's also a bevy of bug fixes and balance changes included in the update, and though EA doesn't specify what the rewards will be, the company does say that players who dig into the new content added in this update will "<em>unlock exclusive Battlefield 6 rewards</em>."</p>



<p>We've still got a while to wait for Battlefield 6's launch, but if you're really craving a bit of what we saw these last two weekends, then this new update, along with the rest of the content already available in Battlefield 2042, will help you get your fix until October 10.</p>

			<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet developer Racoon Logic Studios has just released a new update and a new demo for its sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">2020's Journey to the Savage Planet</a>. The demo is only available on PC, but the update is on all platforms, adding a new photo mode, new habitat customization features, and on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, a new Performance graphics mode that gets the framerate up to 60 FPS.</p>



<p>The news also came with a new trailer, showcasing the features of its fairly extensive photo mode, which lets you make several edits and changes, even add in some of the creatures you'll study and capture over the course of the game's campaign.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the demo, it'll showcase Revenge of the Savage Planet in two parts. The first, which is available now, is just the first hour of the game, giving you a chance to get acquainted with the game's setting and tone in those opening moments.</p>



<p>The second, which will be made available at a later date, is a custom abilities mode, which will let you experience how the game feels when your character is upgraded and kitted out with more gear and tools. It'll also be playable in co-op, which can be a key element to having as much fun as possible in Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>



<p>For the new habitat features, 40 new objects have been added to the game for players to customize their homes with.</p>

<p>"<em>We know that money is tight. We feel you. So if you’re not 100% certain you’ll enjoy our game, here’s a free demo</em>," said Racoon Logic Studios creative director, Alex Hutchinson, in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>Try it. We think you’ll like it. We worked on it for 4 years and now it’s the price of two expensive coffees. You’ll play the tutorial and then maybe fool around with a bunch of late game abilities. Give it a shot. Please?</em>"</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the first game, and have yet to check out Revenge of the Savage Planet, it's worth giving the demo a chance. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">I reviewed it for Wccftech earlier this year, I wrote</a>, "<em>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further.</em>"</p>
