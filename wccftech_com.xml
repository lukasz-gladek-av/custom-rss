			<p>Torn Banner Studios is starting 2025 with a bang, as the first free update of 2025 has been released, taking No More Room in Hell 2 to new, frightening heights. The co-op horror shooter game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-gets-first-early-access-update-adds-new-ending-weapons/">released last year</a> in late October in Early Access and is now getting its first free update that will be adding new gameplay features, enhancements, reworks, and bug fixes to make sure that the audience is well taken care of. Below is a montage of the latest update so you can get a glimpse into some of the gory action that you can expect from the 0.2.4 update for No More Room in Hell 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Montage - 0.2.4 Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWdOg_Q5lYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the main features of this update is the introduction of a new type of zombie, called the Firefighter Zombie. They are recognizable thanks to their firefighter uniform and their oxygen tanks, which can explode if damaged. While the explosion won't damage players, it can be used to the player's advantage to knock down other nearby zombies.</p>
<p>In addition, caliber ammunition has returned to the game, after many fans have asked for it to be revived for No More Room in Hell 2. This includes a variety of ammunition types, meaning that players will have to consider what ammo they want to carry as there is limited space. This makes gameplay more technical, as players will have to make strategic decisions to be able to fight for their survival.</p>
<p>While some new features have been added to make the game more challenging and technical, the developers have reworked the Runner zombies to make them more unpredictable when attacking the player. However, they now spawn less, as the community had asked for in their feedback. This means that their attacks and movement prove to be more of a threat, but they are less likely to appear in your session so you have ample time to deal with them amidst the ongoing chaos.</p>
<p>In addition to caliber ammunition and new zombie types being added to the game, new Responder skills have been introduced in this update. This includes "Immunity," which reduces the chance of infection by half; "Outdoor CHampion," which mitigates damage from fire, gas, water, and electricity by 30%; and "Builder," which increases stack sizes for barricade boards batteries.</p>
<p>The developers have made sure to add a ton of new content in this update, but they have also been focused on making sure to fix any bugs in the game to improve the overall stability of the game. This includes changes like accurate climbing skills, visual appearance of zombies, and infinite ammo exploits.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this update in <a href="https://www.nmrih2.com/2025/01/21/update-0-2-4-our-first-update-for-the-year-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their blog post</a>, which details all of the changes made in this new update for No More Room in Hell 2.</p>

			<p>Today, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II developer/publisher combo Warhorse Studios and PLAION have unveiled the post-launch roadmap for the upcoming first-person roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-release-date-bumped-forward-by-a-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set for February 4</a>, is just the beginning of the players' new journey with Henry of Skalitz. Throughout 2025, the developers plan to constantly release updates that include various improvements and additions.</p>
<p>The roadmap kicks off this Spring with the introduction of several free enhancements, such as a Barbers feature to customize your looks, a Hardcore Mode for those seeking a harsher challenge, and Horse Racing, where you can hone your mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises.</p>
<p>In the Summer, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will receive its first premium DLC, called Brushes with Death. In this new quest, Henry must aid an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past. He'll have to face perilous encounters to unravel a web of dangerous plots.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/KCD2-Roadmap-Image-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In the Fall season, the Legacy of the Forge DLC will dig into Henry's roots by exploring the legacy of Martin, his adoptive father. Henry will work to restore a once-famous forge and test his blacksmithing skills while uncovering forgotten stories from the past.</p>
<p>In the Winter season, the third and final premium DLC, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released. Players must enter Sedlec Monastery, where intrigue is said to run deep. Henry is tasked with a secret mission and must navigate the complex dynamics of the area, uncovering hidden truths and navigating a maze of conflicting interests.</p>

<p>The three premium DLCs are included for those who purchase the more expensive versions of the game: either Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition (which is priced $20 higher than the Standard Edition and comes with the Season Pass, the Shields of Seasons Passing that lets players customize their shields with one of four unique designs, and the full costume Gallant Huntsman’s Kit), or the Collector's Edition that adds the following physical goods for a price of $199:</p>
<ul>
<li>a statue of Henry and his trusty steed, Pebbles</li>
<li>the exclusive cloth map Alleys of Kuttenberg</li>
<li>the enamel pin set Coats of Valor</li>
<li>the iconic Letter of Hope - which Sir Hans Capon was entrusted with</li>
<li>and the King’s Rebels collectible cards set</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the PC system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our previous article</a>.</p>

			<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Shooter Games of 2024 list</a>, we wrote that the genre had bested 2023's output thanks to new releases like Helldivers 2, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Marvel Rivals. Well, now that we look ahead at what's coming in 2025, we can already tell this one's going to be even better - and it might even dwarf prior years if certain <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored launches</a> actually happen. That said, we'll stick to what's been confirmed by publishers to be scheduled for this year. It's already a great-looking list, anyway.</p>

<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sniper-elite-resistance.jpg"></a></h2>
<h2>Sniper Elite: Resistance (January 30)</h2>
<p>The year for shooter games begins with the return of Rebellion's Sniper Elite tactical shooter franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sniper-elite-resistance-gets-january-30-2025-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is out in less than ten days</a>. This time, players will find Harry Hawker, who was available for selection in the cooperative modes of the three previous installments, as the lead character. An agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) division, Hawker discovers the existence of a new wonder weapon, reportedly so powerful that it would practically guarantee the Nazis' victory in the war. He'll have to work with the French Resistance in 1944 Vichy France (the events running in parallel to those seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-5-jager-beware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sniper Elite 5</a>) to locate and destroy the weapon before it can ever be used.</p>
<p>Sniper Elite: Resistance is adding a new Propaganda Mode that is unlocked by discovering hidden Propaganda posters. In this mode, you get to play as a Resistance fighter in quick-fire challenges against the clock. The campaign is also fully playable in co-op, and the fan-favorite, Souls-like inspired <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/sniper-elite-5-how-axis-invasion-works-and-how-to-kill-your-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axis Invasion</a> returns as well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/245e7a61-0c9b-45f7-9dd2-481187b3641e.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>DOOM: The Dark Ages (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>Following the successful releases of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016's DOOM</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020's DOOM Eternal</a>, it's no wonder that The Dark Ages may be topping the personal most anticipated shooter games chart of many genre fans. id Software has successfully recaptured and reimagined what made the franchise great in the first place, and we can't wait to see how this new evolution plays out.</p>
<p>For now, all we know is that this is effectively a prequel that will show how the legend of the DOOM Slayer started. The developers have described it as a 'cinematic origin story' where the protagonist will become the last hope of a medieval fantasy-inspired kingdom against the onslaught of Hellish forces.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BL4-The-Game-Awards.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Borderlands 4 (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>The fifth (despite the title) mainline installment in the cooperative looter shooter series by Gearbox Software was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024 with much fanfare. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-borderlands-4-story-trailer-debuts-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw it again</a> at The Game Awards 2024, where Gearbox debuted a story trailer introducing the new big bad called The Timekeeper. According to the press brief, a world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect order and unleashes chaos on Kairos, the planet Borderlands 4 is set on, which the developers described as the most dangerous planet yet in the series.</p>
<p>The main features revealed so far include deeper, more diverse skill trees; an expanded loot hunt;&nbsp; the ability to travel seamlessly between zones; a dynamic world filled with events and discoverable side content; new traversal mechanics available for both exploration and combat; and even a vehicle that can be summoned almost anywhere on Kairos.</p>

<h2>ARC Raiders (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>Swedish studio Embark may have launched The Finals as their first game, but that was not the first project they announced. That label goes to ARC Raiders, which evolved over the years from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original plan of a PvE co-op shooter</a> to its new form as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PvPvE extraction shooter</a>. We finally got a gameplay trailer of the overhauled game at Geoff Keighley's TGA 2024, and to go with it, Embark shared a thorough overview of the mechanics and features.</p>
<p>In ARC Raiders, players will scavenge the lethal surface in a post-apocalyptic future for supplies and materials, facing enemy ARC machines and other players. As with any extraction game, to keep their loot, players must reach extraction points, risking ambushes to extract vital crafting materials or items to sell to NPC vendors for in-game currency. Players will have their own workshop to craft new equipment, such as advanced weapon mods or unique gadgets, and can also customize their playstyle with a skill tree. NPC merchants will also offer quests to complete on the surface.</p>

<h2>Battlefield 6 (Fall 2025)</h2>
<p>Yes, last but certainly not least, we have the return of Battlefield. After what happened with Battlefield V and 2042, DICE cannot afford to miss again. To that end, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has put Respawn's Vince Zampella in charge of the franchise</a>, and the veteran game designer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the new game will take place in a modern setting. We don't really know many details about Battlefield 6 other than the goal to deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-will-feature-the-most-realistic-and-exciting-destruction-effects-in-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most realistic and exciting destruction ever seen in a game</a> and the fact that there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four development studios busy working on it</a>: DICE (primarily focused on multiplayer), Criterion (both single player and multiplayer), Motive (they're crafting the new campaign), and Ripple Effect (working on a new Battlefield experience, possibly the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-to-launch-in-october-2025-with-f2p-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored free-to-play Battle Royale mode</a>). We should get a lot more official info in the coming months.</p>
