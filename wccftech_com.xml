			<p>If you thought Elden Ring Nightreign was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">difficult before</a>, then tomorrow's new "<em>high difficulty</em>" mode called Deep of Night won't improve your standing with the game. FromSoftware debuted the new game mode today ahead of its arrival tomorrow.</p>



<p>The new mode makes the whole experience more difficult with enemies that hit harder and Nightlords that you won't be able to prepare for by selecting them ahead of your session. You'll just have to be ready for whatever comes your way, and you'll also be continuously delving deeper into difficulty levels the longer you survive.</p>

<p>All that said, you won't be left to fight these increased challenges with the same weapons you use in the rest of the game. Your weapons will also get a boost, but it'll come at a cost, since weapons you pick up will also have detrimental effects that could prove to do more harm than good.</p>



<p>The right build, however, that's smartly put together can help you steamroll even the more difficult enemies you'll face in the Deep of Night mode.</p>



<p>Depth Relics are another new element added to the Deep of Night game mode, and are only available in Deep of Night. These new, stronger relics can be used in combination with your other relics, since they are each slotted into three new places. </p>



<p>All together, Deep of Night is clearly only for those players looking for the next level of challenge in Elden Ring Nightreign. Try it out at your own risk.</p>

			<p>According to Capcom leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965421437784916412">Dusk Golem</a>, not only is <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-gen/">Resident Evil Requiem releasing on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but Capcom has plans to port ever Resident Evil game it has made using its RE Engine to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In response to someone asking Dusk Golem about the ports, they clarify that they're not talking about every Resident Evil game having a Cloud version playable on Switch 2, but a proper native port. Nintendo Switch players will have to remain satisfied with Cloud versions, though, or upgrade to the Switch 2.</p>



<p>"<em>Yee, they've been working on porting all the RE Engine Resident Evil games to Nintendo Switch 2 for a hot minute now. Requiem should be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</em>"</p>



<p>As this exchange happened before today's news about a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/"> Nintendo Direct being confirmed</a>, Dusk Golem continues to say that, "<em>There's grapevine rumor that there's a Nintendo Direct this week &amp; RE7 is going to be there at least</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/2) Yee, they've been working on porting all the RE Engine Resident Evil games to Nintendo Switch 2 for a hot minute now. Requiem should be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 as well. There's grapevine rumor that there's a Nintendo Direct this week &amp; RE7 is going to be there at least <a href="https://t.co/fQw5WBjDXz">https://t.co/fQw5WBjDXz</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1965421437784916412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Dusk Golem adds that they don't know when each of the games will arrive, or if it's a surefire conclusion that Resident Evil VII: Biohazard will show up at this week's Nintendo Direct, just that they "<em>have heard very reliably several times now they're all coming to Switch 2 sooner or later, &amp; that does include Requiem (so RE7, RE:2, RE:3, Village, RE:4, Requiem)</em>."</p>



<p>The current library of Resident Evil games on Nintendo platforms includes classic ports of RE 0, Resident Evil, RE 4, RE 5, RE Revelations, RE Revelations 2, and RE 6. RE VII: Biohazard, RE 2 Remake, RE 3 Remake, and RE Village are all only available through Cloud versions. </p>



<p>If we get an announcement for RE VII: Biohazard on Switch 2 this coming Friday, then it will be at least one game Dusk Golem is right about, meaning they could be right about the rest. We'll see what Friday has in store.</p>
