			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is setting out to be one of the most interesting Nintendo Switch 2 ports launching next year, judging from the footage released so far.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> compared the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">Nintendo Switch 2 version announcement trailer</a> of the next entry in the CAPCOM series with the same trailer captured on PC, highlighting how this port is going to be notable for how it has been built with ray tracing in mind and for how the Nintendo console will support RT in a seemingly competent capacity. </p>



<p>Comparing the two trailers shows how RTGI is present in the Switch 2 version, delivering an experience that looks very much the same as that on the other systems, although with some cutbacks regarding image quality, hair rendering, shadow maps resolution, and reflections, as this version of the game seems to lack RT reflections. Performance also seems to be a little unstable from the footage, but considering it has been captured on a pre-release build, there's a good chance Resident Evil Requiem's performance will better in its final release.</p>

<p>Building the game with ray tracing in mind seems to be doing wonders for the experience as a whole, as Resident Evil Requiem looked stunning when I tried it last month during <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">Gamescom</a>. Although I wasn't able to experience combat, the short sequence set in Rhodes Hill Chronic Center made me very excited to see how the game will push the series forward when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p>

			<p>German independent developer Shin'en Games announced that The Touryst Deluxe will be released digitally on the Nintendo Switch 2 next week, on September 25. Pre-orders are already open via the Nintendo eShop at $19.99, and owners of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Touryst</a> for the original Switch can upgrade for $4.99.</p>



<p>Compared to the original title (which launched in late 2019 for the Switch before making it to PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5), The Touryst Deluxe will add a new arcade game, new items, new quest, and improved visuals. On the 'docked' or TV mode, it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, while handheld mode runs at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second. Now, it should be noted that this is by no means a heavy game to run. In fact, it already ran at 4K resolution on the Xbox Series S back in 2020.</p>



<p>Finally, the studio confirmed that users will have the option to import existing save data from The Touryst.</p>

<p>Here's a brief overview of The Touryst, courtesy of the developer:</p>



<p><em>You are just arriving at the Monument Islands. Want to go swimming? Or rather take a dive into the deep sea? Or do you want to visit the amusement arcade, do some shopping, dance at the beach party? Fancy some surfing? Or will you talk with the strange old tourist and listen what he has to say about these ancient mysterious monuments..</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Discover exotic islands and explore ancient monuments</em></li>



<li><em>Climb into deep mines and uncover secret passages</em></li>



<li><em>Make the trip you always wanted and enjoy the tourist life</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The Touryst Deluxe will be the second game released by Shin'en for the Nintendo Switch 2 after the launch title <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-nintendo-switch-2-q-new-hd-rumble-is-very-impressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAST FUSION</a>, which also runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with HDR support.</p>
