			<p>Following the launch of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> for Game of the Year at The Game Awards), Square Enix is now entirely focused on the third part of the FFVII remake trilogy. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-no-dlc-open-world-minigame-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> there won't be any DLCs for Rebirth to speed up the arrival of the final installment, but what can we expect in that game? Game Director Naoki Hamaguchi talked a bit about his plans in an interview with <a href="https://www.vg247.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-mini-games-naoki-hamaguchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VG247</a>, stating that the goal is to add some sort of different twist to make it a new and exciting experience.</p>
<p><em>I play a lot of games, a lot of open world games, and something I feel whilst playing a lot of these games is that you've got the core mechanics - or their fighting systems - and most of the content you'll encounter, most of the places you can go, most of what you'll be doing, can get repetitive. These games just use the same mechanics. There are no real changes, there’s nothing new to experience around the different regions of these worlds.</em></p>
<p><em>Obviously, there’s a great battle system in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth - and there’s a lot of fun to be had in fighting the various different monsters in each region - but I wanted it to feel like a breath of fresh air when you entered each different region. That you feel like there’s something new and exciting to do when you enter a new area. That you can experience something different with the mechanics. That’s why we wanted to put so many different mini-games in, and I feel we really managed to achieve our goal with that. It’s simply a breath of fresh air in an open world (or ‘open field’, as we call it for Rebirth).</em></p>
<p><em>So, are we going to continue with this same balance going forward? Have we reached perfection? I think if we did just do the same thing again for the third game in the series, then it wouldn’t really be very new or exciting anymore. I want to add a different twist, rearrange things slightly for the next game, and have a slightly different look to things. We don’t just want to make more of the same, we want to make new and exciting experiences.</em></p>
<p>There's no telling yet when the next entry of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy will be released, but it will be at least three years. In the meantime, Rebirth is likely to be released on PC.</p>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is continuing to make amazing progress and is now capable of booting and running multiple console exclusives.</p>
<p>The latest version of the only PlayStation 4 emulator that can run <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-4k-100-fps-rtx-4070/">Bloodborne</a> fairly well is now capable of booting another PlayStation 4 exclusive that is likely to stay so in the foreseeable future, The Last Guardian. The game is not in a playable state whatsoever, as seen in the video below provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, but the fact that the emulator can now boot the game is still impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Guardian New Gameplay on ShadPS4 Emulator" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4K5HWrnFevI?start=9&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it will be a while until The Last Guardian will be playable on PC, the ShadPS4 emulator is more than capable of running other console exclusives like the aforementioned Bloodborne, which obviously was a priority for the developers due to its popularity, Vanillaware's Dragon's Crown Pro and Odin Sphere Leifhrasir, <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/">Gravity Rush Remastered</a> and others. You can check out how these games, as well as over 50 other ones, currently run on the emulator in the video below put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMERNO1INTERNATIONAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GAMER NO 1.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/avowed-30-fps-xbox-series-x/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-will-run-%E2%80%9Cat-least%E2%80%9D-at-30-fps-on-xbox-series-x-obsidian-wants-to-fully-deliver-a-beautiful-world-at-the-best-framerate-possible.1041900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-30-fps-xbox-series-x/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed developer Obsidian Entertainment will make sure the game will run at the very least at 30 frames per second on Xbox Series X, but this framerate is not its target, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@marcello696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parris</a>, Game Director Carrie Patel commented on the performance level that should be expected on Xbox Series X, saying that the game will run at the very least at 30 FPS, but this level of performance is not the team's target. As of now, the developer is fully into performance optimization and is committed to delivering a beautiful world at the best framerate they possibly can.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Preview With Game Director Carrie Patel" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzJTfeOjzkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Judging from this statement, it is definitely a good thing Avowed was delayed to February 2025, as the extra time could allow developer Obsidian to spend more time on optimization and deliver framerates higher than 30 FPS at launch. Phil Spencer himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/">commented</a> on the game's delay, saying that the game's quality didn't cause it and that the developer would make use of the extra time it did not need to release the game.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on February 18th. You can learn more about what makes the game feel fun and engaging in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/">preview.</a></p>

			<p>The latest Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws is <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/">the biggest one yet</a>, and the team has been working towards making some huge changes both in graphics and in gameplay. For the most part, this Title Update has had a significant focus on combat and stealth to allow the player to have more control of their decisions, as well as allowing players to keep hold of pick-up weapons for longer. For those who may be getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws, this is how big the update is on each platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 7.44 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 10.18 GB</li>
<li>PC: 8.83 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notable changes have been made with the latest Title Update in Star Wars Outlaws. Especially when it comes to the stealth and combat options in the game, by updating stealth and combat, players now have more choices to make and can adapt their playstyle accordingly. This includes using stealth or reaching for your blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.</p>
<p>In conjunction with stealth and combat, enemy AI and detection have been improved. Players are now notified when they're being detected, giving them a choice between breaking stealth and engaging in combat or finding a way to change tactics to remain in stealth. Another layer has been added to the combat system, which involves enemy weak points being added to Star Wars Outlaws. This is so that players who engage in strategic gameplay are rewarded for their efforts, leading to the enemies to die in comedic new ways.</p>
<p>Continuing on with the efforts to fix combat, Kay's blaster and pickup weapons have been re-tuned so that the combat experience is smoother and more enjoyable. This includes the option to carry two-handed weapons more frequently throughout the game.</p>
<p>For many people, the animations and character design is what threw them off, as the characters do have a touch of uncanny valley. The developers for Star Wars Outlaws continue to work on this, with facial expressions and animations now being improved in dialogue scenes. This also comes with a new option to toggle the cinematic lens during gameplay, as well as distant lights being more visible when traversing through the game.</p>
<p>These are only the highlights of what was added in this Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws, and the patch notes carry on for quite a while. You can read them in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2842040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded blog post</a>, which goes into detail about everything that has been changed in the game.</p>
