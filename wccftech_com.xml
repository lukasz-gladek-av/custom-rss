            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-combat-and-synthesis-details-revealed-for-atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, KOEI TECMO Europe and developer Gust revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-releases-march-2025/">new details about the upcoming title</a> Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. These details give players a glimpse into the combat system of the game and the synthesis feature. For those excited about the game, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release on 21 March 2025 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. For the first time ever, players will see the Atelier Yumia franchise on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, allowing more platforms than ever to have access to the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of more details about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, KOEI TECMO Europe has released a brand new trailer, which you can watch below. The iconic synthesizing system will be making a return to Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, where players will be tasked with manipulating "mana" to be able to create new items that are beneficial to combat or can aid you in exploring the world around you. As you progress through the game, you'll have to learn how to master Resonance Synthesis, which is where you add ingredients that resonate with each other to create a higher-quality item. It does sound like it's going to be a bit of a tricky system, but it also seems like there's room for trial and error and lots of different combinations to try out.</p>

<p>To make sure that the new Atelier experience is fresh, the combat system has been revamped, offering a real-time combat system with intuitive gameplay. In this new Atelier game, skills that are available for active team members now depends on the distance from the enemy, whether they are close or ranged attacks. This is different from previous games in the franchise, as players are now able to move and swap out characters in the team during active combat. There are now also additional combos that can be activated once the correct conditions are met, allowing for combos such as the "Friend Action" or the "Mana Surge."</p>
<p>Also announced are <a href="https://atelier.games/yumia/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Premium Box and Special Collection Box</a>, which you can pre-order if you want some extra goodies to celebrate the release of Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land.</p>
<p>The Premium Box contains the base game, an art book, a B-3 size cloth poster with an original illustration, a CD, and an Early Access costume for Yumia. Alternatively, there is also the Special Collection Box, which includes all of the content from the Premium Box but also contains the following: a handkerchief in the style of the Aladiss Research Team bandana, an A1 tapestry, six keychains, six clear file folders, a sticker sheet, Yumia's stuffed animal and a short story with an accompanying translation booklet.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> in several interviews last week. In the second half of the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=151716114&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chat</a> with Game File's Stephen Totilo, published over the weekend, the executive said that he'd rather revisit some of Microsoft's many owned intellectual properties than rely on licensed games any further.</p>
<p><em>I'm not the biggest fan [of making licensed games]. It creates some complexities for us when we think about putting it in a subscription or streaming it. We’ve seen it in racing games that have to get delisted because you lose certain licenses. So I'm always very careful, if we're going to take on a license, that we're doing it for creative reasons, that the team has a goal around what they want to do.</em></p>
<p>Of course, Microsoft does have two big triple-A licensed games in development at Bethesda's MachineGames and Arkane Lyon: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-official-concept-art-shared-by-arkane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Blade</a>, respectively, both of which are IPs owned by Disney. On that partnership, Phil Spencer stated:</p>
<p><em>I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney. They've been good partners. We're obviously doing Blade with Arkane Lyon with them. I was just out there visiting with that team. I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world. The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game—the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective. So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the intellectual property that we have that we own. I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited.</em></p>
<p>It's not hard to understand why Phil Spencer would feel that way: Disney isn't known for licensing its prized IPs cheaply. Moreover, Microsoft really does have access to a boatload of unused intellectual properties, from Rare's beloved Conker and Banjo-Kazooie to Killer Instinct and all the IPs from the latest acquisitions (Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p>
<p>Spencer is also known for wearing t-shirts of some of these classic franchises, like Hexen or, more recently, Starcraft, during the Xbox TGS 2024 live broadcast. This gets fans excited about the prospect of reviving those IPs, and today's comments will undoubtedly fuel more chitchat in the respective communities.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Portal 2 RTX Remix mod is now available for download, introducing path tracing to the amazing puzzle game released by Valve over ten years ago.</p>
<p>Portal 2 RTX Remix Compatibility mod, developed by xoxor4d, greatly enhances the game's visuals with path tracing and works surprisingly well despite RTX Remix not being intended to support the game. There are some issues here and there, as the game's effects are rendered using shaders, and performance isn't the best, which isn't surprising considering how demanding path tracing is even in older games, but this mod is a perfectly viable way to experience one of the best games ever released by Valve.</p>
<p>In case you want to check out this Portal 2 RTX Remix mod before downloading it from <a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/p2-rtx">here</a>, you can check it out in action in the video below shared by gabdeg on YouTube.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal 2 with RTX Remix Compatibility Mod" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yORRCNjgVxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Portal 2 is the second entry in the series developed by Valve. Released in 2011, the game takes everything that made the original amazing and ups it to eleven, introducing a new set of puzzles as well as a two-player cooperative mode featuring a story, test chambers, and characters completely different from the single-player campaign. You can learn more about the game by heading over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/">Steam store page.</a></p>

			<p>Despite being one of the games released this year, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is selling below CAPCOM's expectations, due to lacking marketing, among other reasons.</p>
<p>As reported by Japanese outlet <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/396057" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamebiz</a>, the publisher revealed in a Q&amp;A session held at the end of the second quarter financial results briefing that the game failed to reach the planned sales despite widespread acclaim from critics and players. According to CAPCOM, one of the reasons Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is not selling as expected is lacking marketing, which did not raise enough awareness of the game. As such, the Japanese publisher plans to continue promoting the game to make it achieve its sales target.</p>
<p>While Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess hasn't done well, the other titles CAPCOM released during the second quarter of the current fiscal year are doing much better. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is selling as planned, with plans to continue promotion to support the sales of the retail release coming this month. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">MARVEL vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> and Ace Attorney Investigations Collection are also selling as planned.</p>
<p>It is a massive shame that Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is not selling as well as CAPCOM expected, as it's a very solid game that deserves to be experienced by more players. You can learn more about the game and how it masterfully blends together multiple genres by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">review.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Dark Souls 3 Remaster is Currently in the Works – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-dark-souls-3-remaster-is-currently-in-the-works-%E2%80%93-rumor.1038252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Dark Souls 3 remaster is apparently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the XboxEra podcast, Nick "Shpeshal_Nick" Baker revealed that a remaster of the third entry in the series developed by FromSoftware is in the works. Sadly, the leaker confirmed that he knows more about this project but cannot say more at the time, so we have no idea who's developing it and how it will improve the original game, which, in my opinion, has aged rather well and is most definitely not in dire need of a remaster, especially since both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S run the original release quite well.</p>
<p><iframe title="South of Midnight looks great &amp; Phil Spencer talks Xbox's Future | The XboxEra Podcast | Episode 237" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mmo392kpNoA?start=14901&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Although Dark Souls 3 doesn't need to be remastered that badly, a remaster makes sense, considering the first two entries in the series got <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-remastered-revisiting-lordran/">remastered</a> after their original release. Besides obvious image quality improvements and a potential release on the Nintendo Switch successor, it will be interesting to see in what other ways the game will be improved if this remaster is really in the works. Shpeshal_Nick has a decent track record, but we should still take this with a grain of salt until an official confirmation is made.</p>
<p>The original Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-iii-review/">review.</a></p>
