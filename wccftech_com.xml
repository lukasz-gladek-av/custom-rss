			<p>Funcom's large-scale multiplayer survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/">Dune: Awakening</a> is now out for all players after its strong head-start weekend, with a new gameplay trailer debuted to mark the event.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening has already had a great start to its launch, with more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">117K players at once jumping in for the head start weekend,</a> which was only available to those who had pre-ordered the game's deluxe edition. Anyone who just bought the base game is free to head to Arrakis now, but it's a credit to Funcom that the game is already hitting high concurrent numbers like that with just deluxe edition owners.</p>
<p>While Dune: Awakening is out for players on PC today, it isn't out for those looking to head to Arrakis on consoles. We've known for a while now that the game would be coming to PC first, but it looks like players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will have to wait until next year to play Dune: Awakening.</p>
<p>In a press release for today's launch, Funcom confirmed that the game will be out on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S "<em>sometime in 2026</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also debuted a new trailer for the full launch, which is a massive cut of previous trailers smashed together for the game's full launch.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, ahead of today's launch, Funcom's chief executive and technical officer, Rui Casais, delivered a message to players, thanking those who had already jumped in for play, and their patience, as Funcom does its best to respond to any issues that come up in the course of the game's launch.</p>
<p>"<em>Believe it or not, we do look at all your feedback across social media, Discord, support tickets, and Steam reviews. And we're working around the clock to mitigate any issues you find and improve the overall experience,</em>" Casais said in his video to players.</p>
<p>He also addressed players who have expressed issues with long queue times, saying that more servers will be added for today's full launch, and that Funcom is working to make sure player distribution between servers is evenly balanced. "<em>Worry not, there is enough capacity for all of you,</em>" Casais said.</p>
<p>And though Casais expressed confidence that Funcom is on top of everything with the launch of its latest big online multiplayer game, that didn't stop him from asking players to have some patience with the studio in these early days.</p>
<p>"<em>Funcom has been making online worlds like this for 25 years, and I have been personally doing it for soon 24, and I can tell you this is my most exciting launch so far. I can't wait to see more of you enjoying the game, and would ask you to please bear with us, if not everything is silky smooth when we open the game tomorrow. This is only the beginning. We have years' worth of plans for Dune: Awakening, and I want to once again thank you all for joining us on this journey.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch 2 Is Nintendo’s Biggest Launch Ever In The UK, But It Still Didn’t Beat The PS5 Or Xbox Series X/S]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-launch-ever-in-the-uk-but-it-still-didnt-beat-the-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-s/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">The Game Business</a>, data firm NielsenIQ shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is the biggest Nintendo console launch in the UK ever. Still, it's not the biggest console launch in the region ever, with the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series consoles still ahead of it.</p>
<p>While the report doesn't provide a specific number, The Game Business says the Switch 2 beat out week-one launch sales in the UK for the Nintendo Switch "<em>by more than two to one,</em>" and also pointed out that the Nintendo Switch managed to sell a little more than 80K units in the UK when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo 3DS, which used to have the record for the best UK launch for a Nintendo device, sold 113K units in its launch.</p>
<p>The Game Business also listed the top-10 console launches in the UK by sales units, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now firmly in fourth place. Here's the full list, per The Game Business:</p>
<ol>
<li>PlayStation 5</li>
<li>PlayStation 4</li>
<li>Xbox Series</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2</li>
<li>PlayStation 3</li>
<li>Xbox One</li>
<li>Nintendo Wii</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Xbox 360</li>
<li>Xbox One X</li>
</ol>
<p>Reports from the PS5's UK launch claimed it sold more than <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-ps5-was-the-uks-biggest-ever-console-launch/">250K units in just two days after launch</a>, and more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-best-selling-next-gen-uk/">450K by the end of 2020</a>. So, until any actual sales numbers are reported, we know that the Switch 2 sold more than 113K units and less than 250K.</p>
<p>It didn't set the all-time record for the UK, but there's no denying that somewhere between 113-250K is a very strong launch for just one region. The Switch 2 also might've set all-time records elsewhere, as it's currently claimed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-allegedly-frances-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-over-200k-sold-so-far/">Switch 2 is now France's fastest-selling console ever</a>, and that Nintendo moved 200K units in France in the console's opening weekend.</p>
