			<p>A new era of online multiplayer PvP battles will be coming on March 4, when War Robots: Frontiers releases and is set to redefine the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">tactical mech warfare genre</a>. For those who want to play this game, it will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One <a href="https://warrobotsfrontiers.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for free</a>. To celebrate the announcement of the release date, you can check out the brand new cinematic trailer that was released.</p>
<p><iframe title="War Robots: Frontiers | Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWLV7KZFSH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In War Robots: Frontiers, players will get the opportunity to be in the cockpit of their mechs and experience piloting a War Robot. War Robots is already a massive franchise, with over 270 million fans across the globe. War Robots: Frontiers is said to be a huge step for the franchise, a game that has been built from the ground up for both PC and console in Unreal Engine 5. It will be a game that is ideal for those who like competitive play.</p>
<p>Its also been developed to be relatively accurate and authentic, where every step the mech takes will reverberate with authentic weight. Every shot that is fired from your mech will have realistic recoil. Being developed in Unreal Engine 5 means that this game will give players a highly realistic and dynamic battlefield to fight on, where every single move and shot made by the mechs will have realistic movement and help you feel as if you are actually in the mech.</p>
<p>Customization will be a major feature of War Robots: Frontiers, where players can design their mechs in any way they want to, from the chassis, core, weapons, and skill upgrades to create a mech that fits your playstyle and the way you want to tackle combat. By having this much customization, you can choose whether your mech is a huge chunk of steel with firepower, or you can streamline it so that it has agile defenses and the ability to outplay the opponent.</p>
<p>If you're new to the War Robots franchise, this game is aiming to be highly accessible for the newer generations and new players. This includes the ability to play the game by utilizing prebuilt mechs so that you can get used to the look and feel of the game before being overwhelmed by building your own mech. Of course, for those who prefer to build from the ground up, you'll be able to customize it as much as you need to in order to make it battlefield-ready.</p>
<p>The game will also have cross-platform online play, so you can play with your friends on PC and console. There will be multiple game modes available, including ranked modes for those who prefer a dedicated challenge.</p>
<p>War Robots: Frontiers will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 4.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/blade-soul-neo-a-remaster-of-the-classic-mmorpg-is-coming-soon-to-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade &amp; Soul NEO</a>&nbsp;<span>will be released on February 25, and we were recently given the opportunity to interview NC America's Andrew Long, Senior Producer, and Andrew Gant, Community Manager, about the upcoming release and what players can expect from the MMORPG&nbsp;Blade &amp; Soul Live will </span>continue to exist at the same time, with updates being released for that title alongside this new and improved version of the game.</p>
<p>Before the interview, I was given an exclusive look at the game in a presentation. This presentation showed off the expansive customization available, where you can tweak characters in any way you can imagine to make them fully yours.</p>
<p>When the game launches, it will be launching with seven of the 14 classes that are currently available in Blade &amp; Soul Live. As you explore the game, there will be many different outfits that you can collect to keep your character fashionable while facing off against bosses or other players in PvP. Additionally, those who purchase the exclusive <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/news/article/14645/bns-neo-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order bundles</a> will also get some special outfits and cosmetics. The graphics are revamped, giving the game a fresh coat of paint. As the developers stated, the story will be the beloved Blade &amp; Soul story that you know and love, with some extra improvements made along the way.</p>
<p>In the interview, I made sure to ask some of the burning questions that the dedicated community had, as well as get some answers to questions of my own.</p>
<p><strong>What went into the decision to remake Blade &amp; Soul now rather than earlier or later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> A lot of us have this nostalgia where we feel like when the game launched in our time frame, it was the best it's ever been, and so, we really wanted to relive that experience and address it with new audiences, there's a whole new generation of people who weren't even born yet, or old enough to play video games at the time Blade &amp; Soul launched. We want to have that interaction between the old and the new, playing all together in that experience.</p>
<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO is adding a lot of features to make the game friendlier for new audiences, including the addition of infinite Windwalking. Prior to this, you had an allotted amount of Windwalking that you could do before you ran out of stamina. Now, you can Windwalk as much as you like, which will allow you to scale new buildings, take pictures in new locations that you would have never been able to reach in the previous version of the game, and much more.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be ranked systems for PvP or PvE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> When our 6v6 battlegrounds come out, we'll have the awards attached to those. At the time of launch, there's not going to be any of those systems in the game. But, the battleground 6v6 arena does come very quickly after the launch. We want to monitor how people are going to take the launch, and we're going to enjoy that content, and when we see people getting towards the end of it, we have that content ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to add new classes that didn't exist in the original?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> As far as classes go, in Live we're up to 14 classes. We want to introduce those into NEO as well. We don't have a timeline exactly... As far as new classes, it's something we're going to look into; I don't have anything to share at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any stories or expansions added to NEO that won't be added to Live and vice versa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> I don't want to spoil anything, but that is definitely something we want to do.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite part of NEO compared to Live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gant:</strong> It comes down to what kind of MMO gamer you are, I love adventure and exploration. I'll probably be gobbling up the infinite Windwalking and exploring every single section of the map, looking for hidden places, and probably trying to get my friends to climb a building that you've never been able to get to the top of just to take pictures. I love the new aspects and exploration journal that we've added, these little hidden unlockables that you can find from exploring the world.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> I'm really excited, we've changed how the gear drops in Blade &amp; Soul NEO. In Live, you get all of your weapons and accessories at a base level, and the base level is all the same. You go through a zero to 20 upgrade system, and it's very harsh. I'm not a big fan of that system, personally. What we've done in NEO is more of a traditional style. We've really upped the drop rates of thing,s and the secondary stats are going to be randomized. You're going to be able to get a lot more gear... I'm really excited that I'm not going to have to run a dungeon a thousand times before I even see a piece of gear that is what I want.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any plans for controller compatibility down the line?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> Currently, we don't have controller compatibility at the moment. We are going to be looking at other platforms, whether it's going to be console or Steam. We're definitely looking at that right now. At the time of launch, we will not have controller support available.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gant:</strong> I know we have DLSS available, but I'm not sure about the other. There are an incredible amount of customizations you can do so that your machine can run NEO just fine. The recommended specifications are very similar, if not the same, as the ones for Blade &amp; Soul Live.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
<p>The team behind Blade &amp; Soul NEO has a lot planned to ensure that the game is friendly and accessible to new audiences. This includes completely optional PvP, gathering systems, and plenty of gear to unlock. The story will be authentically Blade &amp; Soul, with the improved visuals bringing a fresh lick of paint to a game that is beloved by its community. Blade &amp; Soul NEO will be available for <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/neo/trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free on PC</a> on February 25 in North America and Europe.</p>
