			<p>More early PlayStation 5 Pro footage was shared online, showing how the new system runs Final Fantasy VII Rebirth like a dream.</p>
<p>The second entry in the remake trilogy, released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">earlier this year</a>, has recently been updated with its PS5 Pro patch. This patch introduces a Versatility Mode that vastly improves the game's image quality over the base model's Performance Mode, as shown in the video below shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@The21Master" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gabriel Master</a>. Needless to say, this looks like the best way to enjoy the game before the PC version arrives sometime in the future.</p>

<p>Gabriel Master also shared footage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a> running on PlayStation 5 Pro, which seems to sport slightly better image quality and more stable performance even without a dedicated patch. The same user also tested Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on the new system, which runs at a more stable framerate in 120 FPS mode. Any other improvement for the latest entry in the series will come on November 7th, when the game's PS5 Pro patch will go live.</p>

<p>These three games aren't the only ones the PlayStation 5 Pro improves. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-significantly-performance-improvements-game-boost/">Yesterday</a>, Gabriel Master shared footage of other titles, which highlighted how some of them benefit greatly from the console's increased power and features over the base model, such as Dragon's Dogma 2. PlayStation 4 games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and Bloodborne also look somewhat better on the new system thanks to the Game Boost feature.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

			<p>The latest version of the ShadPS4 emulator continues to improve Bloodborne's performance on PC, fixing a critical issue and more.</p>
<p>As showcased by GAMESMARK in a new video, version 0.4.1 of the emulator, which is not yet available to the public, runs the game with full audio and no longer requires a mod workaround to work properly. Performance seems to be extremely solid as well, as the game runs at 4K resolution and around 100 FPS on a system powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, an RTX 4070 GPU, and 32 GB of DDR5 RAM.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bloodborne PC Huge Progress (Audio Finally Working Without Mod) ~ ShadPS4 v0.4.1 WIP - FPS Unlocked" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yFfO-FLJzE?start=6&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest public version of the ShadPS4 emulator, which is finally making it possible to enjoy Bloodborne on PC after it has been stuck on PlayStation 4 since its release, was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-version-0-4-0-download/">last week.</a> The 0.4.0 version of the emulator packs tons of improvements and fixes, including shader recompiler fixes, emulated support for CPUs that don't have SSE4.2a, an auto-update feature, swap chain recreation and window resizing, improved keyboard navigation in the game list, working touchpad support, multiple install folders, improved Vulkan support and more. This version of the emulator also runs Gravity Rush Remastered, another game that is not currently available on PC, without any workaround.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-is-unlikely-to-be-revealed-before-the-end-of-the-year.1027716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is unlikely to be revealed before the end of the year, as the official announcement of the system during a critical season could significantly impact the company.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/">Reuters</a>, Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda commented on the yet-to-be-revealed system, saying that making an announcement before the end of the year has gotten quite difficult, as Nintendo would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical end-of-year shopping season.</p>
<p>Given how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/">last quarter has been pretty underwhelming for Nintendo</a>, the statement from Yasuda-san makes quite a lot of sense, as the Japanese company will want a much better quarter to close out the fiscal year before going all-in with the Nintendo Switch 2. A reveal in the first few months of 2025 also suggests that the console will indeed not launch anytime before April 2025, something that was also suggested by a report from August, which revealed that multiple developers were told not to expect the console to launch in early 2025.</p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 other than that it has been in the works for a while. According to leaks, the console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">shouldn't look too different</a> from its predecessor and should support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/">NVIDIA DLSS</a> and Ray Reconstruction, which would let it deliver solid performance and possibly better ray tracing than other current-generation systems.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Gets Free AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation Mod]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-gets-free-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-gets-free-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod.1027698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-gets-free-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a year and a half since PureDark <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-elden-ring-is-out-now-delivering-substantial-performance-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> his Elden Ring NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation mod. The paid mod allowed GeForce RTX 40 Series owners a significant performance boost in the notoriously badly optimized game developed by FromSoftware.</p>
<p>However, everyone else without an RTX 40 Series GPU has been out of luck so far. That changes with the recently released free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/6794?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR Frame Generation and Temporal Super Resolution (ERSS-FG) mod</a> by Nexus Mods user huutaiii.</p>
<p>This mod supports AMD FSR 3 Super Resolution and Frame Generation, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA, and even Intel XeSS. The modder shared a few caveats: this is mutually exclusive with their previous ERSS2 mod (which did not support Frame Generation); the Frame Generation feature is not compatible with ReShade; and, most importantly, you can't play online on official servers with this mod enabled.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Here's the recommended installation method for this Elden Ring AMD FSR 3 mod:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extract the attached file's content into the ELDEN RING\Game\ directory (including ERSS-FG.dll, dxgi.dll and the folder ERSS2; the file ERSSReShadeStub.addon can be removed).</em></li>
<li><em>Disable Easy Anti-Cheat, either by putting cmd /c start eldenring.exe &amp; rem %command% in launch options in Steam or by using some other tool.</em></li>
<li><em>For Steam Deck (Linux) users: cmd=(%command%); cmd[-1]="eldenring.exe"; WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b;dxgi=n,b" "${cmd[@]}"</em></li>
<li><em>Set Resolution in the game's Graphics menu to <span>.</span>r target resolution (i.e. your monitor's resolution)</em></li>
<li><em>Open the mod's configuration overlay with the Home key, set Frame Generation method to AMD FSR then restart, and set Super Sampling setting to the upscaling technology of your choice</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several known issues with the current release of this Elden Ring AMD FSR 3 mod, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Flickering global illumination, most visible in shaded areas</em><br>
<em><strong>Workarounds</strong>:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Restarting the game may make it go away temporarily</em></li>
<li><em>Using the GI Glitch Mitigation options in Advanced Settings -&gt; Frame Generation (which may reduce frame rate slightly depending on which option you select)</em></li>
<li><em>Rolling back NVIDIA GPU drivers to version 552.12</em></li>
<li><em>Using DXVK + VKD3D (doesn't support DLSS on Windows)</em></li>
<li><em>Setting Global Illumination to Low can reduce the intensity</em></li>
<li><em>Some reported that turning on Ray tracing can make the issue go away.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Game UI color is slightly off &amp; requires manual configuration in HDR</em></li>
<li><em>There may be some glitches on non-16:9 resolutions outside of the main 16:9 screen area</em></li>
<li><em>Conflicts with other overlay mods (using standalone installation method)</em></li>
<li><em>Cannot be loaded by adding to Special K plug-ins. It can run alongside SK with the included DXGI.dll loader albeit with some issues</em></li>
<li><em>FSR FG + Special K: if Elden Ring's screen mode is set to Full-screen, the game will constantly try to reset it's output swap chain causing flashes</em></li>
<li><em>The Special K overlay is invisible</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Even with these caveats and issues, this might still be useful for those who have been waiting for the right time to dive back into Elden Ring and play the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a>.</p>

			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has witnessed a fantastic launch, probably the franchise's most successful entry, as it captured the attention of over half of the US Xbox Series S/X players.</p>
<p>Well, it won't be wrong to say that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has managed to put behind all the woes we had with Activision and partners in terms of their take on the franchise since the newest entry has managed to break all previous records, in terms of the anticipation and hype. During Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-fy25-q1-total-gaming-revenue-up-by-43-all-from-activision/">recent earnings call</a>, CEO Satya Nadella verified that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/">established new franchise records</a> and has been described as the "biggest" release of the Call of Duty series.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis by Circana CEO and analyst Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7suuurekr2l">via Bluesky</a>), it is now revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has managed to grasp the attention of "one out of every two Xbox Series S/X players," which is indeed a massive achievement for the franchise, given that the Game Pass inclusion has surely worked out for Activision and partners.</p>
<p><em>According to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, on Oct 23rd, 19% of US active Xbox Series players and 18% of US active PlayStation 5 players launched Call of Duty HQ. </em></p>
<p><em>On October 28th, 52% of active XBS players and 34% of active PS5 players did so. Both were all-time highs for Call of Duty HQ.</em></p>
<p>Despite Xbox users having an edge with Game Pass access, PlayStation users weren't left behind at all in the hype, as one-third of the active PS5 consumer base were involved in checking the title out, showing that Activision is getting love from all gaming platforms. Not just the US, but the title did manage to draw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/">largest traffic ever for a game in the UK</a>, and while we haven't seen any metrics surface, the indicators clearly show that the cumulative player count is going to be a phenomenal one.</p>
<p>It is surely exciting to see the Call of Duty franchise making a massive comeback, and the Xbox-Activision partnership has definitely catalyzed the increase in player count due to the ease of accessing the title through Game Pass.</p>
