			<p>Former Guitar Hero and DJ Hero developers, and the creators of the new line of <a href="https://crkd.gg/">CRKD</a> guitars have come together to form <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/">RedOctane Games</a>, a new rhythm game-focused studio that has just entered full production of its debut title, which is set to be revealed later in 2025.</p>



<p>If the RedOctane name sounds familiar to you, that's because RedOctane Inc. was the studio who teamed up with Harmonix to create and publish the first Guitar Hero game back in 2005. It also worked on Guitar Hero II with Harmonix before it was acquired by <a href="https://archive.ph/20120905022821/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/activision-paid-100-mln-redoctane">Activision in 2006</a>, and then under the Activision banner, made Guitar Hero III and Guitar Hero World Tour alongside Neversoft. However, like many other studios under Activision, RedOctane Inc. was caught up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-02-12-activision-shuts-down-redoctane-underground-development.html">in a round of layoffs in 2010</a>, with the whole studio being shut down and laid off.</p>



<p>Now, RedOctane Inc. is reborn in the form of RedOctane Games, headed up by Simon Ebejer, who worked on the Guitar Hero series since Guitar Hero III as part of Neversoft, and most recently worked on Diablo IV as the vice president of operations on the Diablo franchise at Blizzard. Brothers Charles Huang and Kai Huang, who originally founded RedOctane Inc. in 1999, are still part of the RedOctane journey, and confirmed to be members of RedOctane Games' special advisory board.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Beyond Ebejer and the Huang brothers, a press release for the announcement states that the studio is made up of veteran talent who worked on the games that RedOctane was known for nearly two decades ago, and "<em>proven emerging development talent and community leaders from across today's rhythm gaming space</em>." And while the team's first title is set to be revealed later this year, the studio is currently working on "<em>a range of innovative rhythm-based experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Rhythm games are about more than just gameplay, they're about feel, flow, and connection to the music and to each other,</em>" Ebejer said in the press release. "<em>RedOctane Games is our way of giving back to a genre that means so much to us, while pushing it forward in new and exciting directions</em>."</p>



<p>The press release also continues to say that RedOctane Games "<em>is ready to deliver the next evolution in rhythm gaming</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This game wonâ€™t be Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Guitar Freaks or Rockband. This is something new," </em>a <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1">blog post</a> on the studio's website from Lee Guinchard reads. "<em>A rhythm game built with love, by people who care, with the community at its core in this fast-changing modern world we live in. We firmly believe the expert here is the community and a new generation of development talent, the folks that have kept the lights on these last few years.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what RedOctane Games has in the works. Rhythm games are still a significant part of the video game industry, even if they're not taking over living rooms with multiple plastic instruments anymore. Hopefully, we're not waiting too much longer into the rest of 2025 to see what RedOctane Games' debut title is.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1952716473656385840">announced</a> that it would be hosting a Nintendo Indie World Direct on Thursday, August 7, 2025, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST. Like its previous indie-focused presentations, it'll be a shorter, 15-minute long direct, with updates and announcements for several indie games, but according to Nintendo-focused creator and leaker Switchforce, don't expect one of those games to be Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>



<p>Last week, Nintendo hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase Direct</a>, which included several announcements from its third-party partners, like the release date reveal for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-september-5/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a new Octopath Traveler game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">Monster Hunter Stories 3's</a> reveal, and a new HD-2D action-RPG from Square Enix called <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, to name a few.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was technically a showcase where Silksong could have shown up, but like many other potential games that could've appeared, it was absent. Tomorrow's Indie World direct is the second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, and while it's once again another place where Silksong could appear, Switchforce claims that it's not going to happen.</p>



<p>"<em>You do not have Hollow Knight: Silksong being shown off this Thursday, I'll just tell you that right now. I know some people are getting very excited, but as far as I'm aware, that is not in the cards.</em>"</p>

<iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Just Got Even Better â€” And Thereâ€™s MORE ComingðŸ‘€" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tuvr5j3HvXQ?start=203&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Switchforce continues to point out a key factor as to why we probably won't see it tomorrow, which is the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Silksong is confirmed to be at Gamescom 2025</a>, and that there will be a demo available for attendees to check out the game themselves. If any Silksong news is coming soon, it'll likely happen at the same event where people could immediately try it out after learning of a release date, for example.</p>



<p>So if you're anxiously awaiting any spec of news on Silksong, keep your anxieties under control until <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom ONL 2025</a> on August 19, 2025. Silksong is very likely to grace that showcase, since those at Gamescom will be able to watch the new trailer, potentially have a release date to look forward to, and then try it out for themselves on the show floor the next day.</p>



<p>Which is hopefully what happens. It's been years of players waiting and hoping to see Silksong at every big showcase, whether it's a Nintendo showcase or not. It'll be good to put this all to bed when we finally get a release date, and when Silksong is finally on store shelves. </p>
