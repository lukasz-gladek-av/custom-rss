			<p>The Suikoden series revival will not stop with the HD remasters of the first two entries in the series launching this week, as revealed during a livestream that aired a few hours ago.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://youtu.be/TIjGwGAJJ4s?si=sIKc_fHQknKkO5CO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live broadcast</a>, Konami confirmed that the series will continue with a new mobile game called Suikoden STAR LEAP. Set between the fifth and first entry in the series, the game will feature a story that is part of the canon of the series, beautiful 2D graphics inspired by the first two entries in the series, returning characters like Viktor, Flik, and Odessa, many of the gameplay features that define the series, such as the ability to recruit 108 characters and more. While it will be a gacha game, it has been confirmed that the 108 Stars of Destiny can all be obtained without pulls, and only legacy characters will be obtainable with the typical gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>While Suikoden STAR LEAP will offer fans of the series the chance to experience a new story set in the series' universe, the aforementioned animated show, on the other hand, is clearly meant to expand the series' reach beyond its existing fanbase. In the works by Konami's animation studio and NBC Universal Entertainment Japan, the animated show will introduce new fans to the deep lore of Suikoden II. Hopefully, it will not shy away from showing some of the original game's most chilling sequences, which all involve one of the game's main villains, the iconic Luca Blight.</p>
<p>The Suikoden Live livestream also featured new information on merchandise, which will mostly be released only in Japan, orchestral performances of the series' iconic music, and more. You can check the full livestream below.</p>

<p>This week is going to be a great one for fans of the series, as the Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remasters: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars finally launch on PCs and consoles worldwide on <a href="https://wccftech.com/suidkoen-i-ii-remaster-release-date/">March 6th</a>. The collection includes the first two entries in the series, complete with plenty of enhancements, including visual improvements and new quality-of-life features.</p>

			<p>CAPCOM <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this morning that Monster Hunter Wilds has already set new record sales. In the first three days since launch, the game sold over eight million units, becoming the fastest game to do so in the Japanese publisher's 45-year history.</p>
<p>This record-breaking milestone is not at all unexpected, given the immense hype surrounding the game after the highly successful entries Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise. Moreover, this past weekend, Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a user concurrency peak of 1.38 million on Steam, stepping into the platform's all-time top five for this chart.</p>
<p>Of course, user reviews are still quite low at 58%, mostly due to the game's performance on PC. For now, CAPCOM hasn't said if they will improve the game's technical side, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are a few mods that might help</a>. Overall, though, this is a great game if you're into this type of experience, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM has also promoted franchise producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, likely as a result of the series' excellent sales results. Starting on April 1, he'll replace Yoichi Egawa as the publisher's executive corporate officer and chief product officer.</p>
