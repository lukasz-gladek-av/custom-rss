			<p>Pathologic 3: Quarantine is a free prologue for <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathologic 3</a>, and it will be released in just a few weeks, as revealed yesterday by developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher Hype Train Digital. It's been described as a story-driven adventure about a young scientist, Daniil Dankovsky, and his quest for immortality and a mysterious plague outbreak in a small town.&nbsp;Players will learn how the scientist's story began and what drove him to leave his acclaimed lab. They'll examine patients, uncover strange secrets, and take their first steps toward defeating death.</p>
<p>The developers have prepared a significant narrative twist: the narrative is told through unreliable narrators, including Dankovsky's subjective lens and the lens of his persecutors. The story is also said to be non-chronological. That is to say, it will be told out of order.</p>
<p>As a doctor, Dankovsky will try to fight the Sand Plague by examining and diagnosing patients, but also by investigating their lives to find out the unpleasant truths they may be hiding. He can also issue decrees based on new findings to save more lives. Moreover, Dankovsky has a sharp mind, and everything he sees can tell a story and become part of his mental map of the world, encouraging Pathologic 3: Quarantine players to pay attention to everything in the environment.</p>
