			<p>A Chinese analyst group called XR Research Institute has claimed that the next Valve Virtual Reality headset has already entered production and will ship this year, with an estimated initial order of 400K-600K units in the first year. </p>



<p>The news has been <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by UploadVR</a> and confirmed by Valve leakers Tyler McVicker and Brad Lynch (SadlyItsBradley). The latter also <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1976141425801822419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that two VR headset models, Deckard DV1 and Deckard DV2, have appeared in the latest SteamVR beta update. According to Valve's nomenclature, DV units are supposedly the final stage of in-development hardware before retail units, which are labeled 'PV'.</p>



<p>This suggests two headsets could be coming instead of just one, or at least two SKUs. Either way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-deckard-vr-headset-rumored-to-launch-in-late-2025-at-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous rumor</a> that Valve's second Virtual Reality headset, Deckard, would launch in late 2025 seems much more likely now. That rumor pointed to a $1200 price tag, which remains unconfirmed by other leakers at this time.</p>



<p>Deckard will be Valve's second attempt with Virtual Reality following the Index, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-valve-index-vr-kit-priced-e1079-out-on-june-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in June 2019 at $999</a>. The Index also got a so-called killer application: its purchase came with a free copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-release-date-valve-index-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, the first new installment (albeit technically a prequel) in the series in a long time. Half-Life: Alyx was long considered the gold standard when it comes to triple-A Virtual Reality games, but even that was not enough to really sell consumers on the Index. As of January 2025, only 13.2% of the VR headsets connected to the Steam platform were Index devices, as revealed by the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey.</p>



<p>Has Valve prepared another new game to try and boost the sales of its upcoming Deckard VR headset? Either way, we should know soon. Brad Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1976141799560200611">seems to think</a> an official announcement could come either this month or the next one. </p>

			<p>A few (fewer than ten, at this time) former ZeniMax Online developers who worked <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the cancelled game Project Blackbird</a> and The Elder Scrolls Online have just announced <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sackbird Studios</a>. This new Baltimore-based indie developer was inspired by the cancellation of Project Blackbird to build a studio that avoids the pitfalls experienced across the industry.</p>



<p>Lee Ridout, Chief Executive Officer at Sackbird Studios, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people. When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.</em></p>



<p>David Worley, Chief Operating Officer at Sackbird Studios, added:</p>



<p><em>After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets. We’re fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games.</em></p>



<p>Sackbird Studios has already started working on an original project for PC and consoles, though, of course, this is way too early to discuss it. The only hint was shared on LinkedIn, where the studio suggested that its mandate is to 'create unforgettable multiplayer experiences that surprise and thrill players'.</p>



<p>Still, we'll monitor the studio's progress over the years. Stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-assassins-creed-19th-century-post-civil-war-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-a-19th-century-post-american-civil-war-era-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-game-last-year.1320223/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil">Stephen Totilo at Game File (paywalled)</a>, Ubisoft cancelled an Assassin's Creed game in 2024 that would have been set in the 19th century, specifically in a post-American Civil War era setting. Players would have taken on the role of a Black man who had been enslaved in the American South before the war, now living in the western regions of the country, looking to start a new life.</p>



<p>That is, until you would have been recruited by the Order of Assassins and sent back to the American South to face a growing Templar threat, which would have, according to Totilo's report, seen your character "<em>confront the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan</em>."</p>



<p>Totilo's report comes from a mix of five current and former Ubisoft employees who all spoke under anonymity, who claim that the game was cancelled for two main reasons.</p>



<p>The first was Ubisoft deciding it didn't want to go through the same online turmoil it went through <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/">over the inclusion of Yasuke</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows. The second reason was that Ubisoft management ultimately seemed to believe that releasing an Assassin's Creed game with this setting would have been like stepping on the third rail in the United States with regards to the game's political setting.</p>



<p>"<em>Too political in a country too unstable, to make it short</em>," a source reportedly told Game File. Another source added, "<em>I was terribly disappointed by not surprised by leadership. They are making more and more decisions to maintain the political 'status quo' and take no stand, no risk, even creative</em>."</p>



<p>This wouldn't have been the first time Ubisoft has broached atrocities like slavery in its historical settings. Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry was a spin-off to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, where you play as Adéwalé, a Black man from Trinidad who was a slave before his time on Edward Kenway's ship in the Black Flag campaign. Beyond your regular Assassin's Creed stealth and action gameplay, a core element of the story was freeing other Black people who had been enslaved by the Templars.</p>



<p>In fact, you could argue that making the kind of game described by the report here would be the next logical step if you wanted to continue exploring the idea of a character fighting back against those who enslaved him and those like him.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that for all the 'backlash' Ubisoft received online for having Yasuke as one of two protagonists, Assassin's Creed Shadows had a stellar launch <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/assassins-creed-shadows/">from a critical</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/"> commercial perspective</a>, and even now <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">is still one of the best-selling games of 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Ubisoft would have been able to execute on this story is another matter, but the fact that Ubisoft management allegedly deemed a story that would have, among other things, pointed out the very obvious fact that slavery is an awful, terrible, and disgusting stain on human history, "<em>too political</em>," is telling in its own way.</p>
