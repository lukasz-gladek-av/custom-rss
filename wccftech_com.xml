			<p>Since the previous sales milestone for Persona in March 2024, the series has gone on to sell a whopping 23.5 million copies across the globe, with the sales including both physical and digital. In March, it was reported that the Persona series had sold 22.6 million copies. This was announced shortly after the release of Persona 3 Reload, which sold more than one million copies in less than a week. The Persona series is continuing to expand and become more popular, as it was once considered a niche series. However, as announced in <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/library/printing_annual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sega's Annual Integrated Report</a> for 2024, the report now includes the updated cumulative sales for the most notable IPs for Sega. This, of course, included Persona.</p>
<p>In this report, Sega says that the fast sales growth for both the Persona and Like a Dragon franchise can be attributed to the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-annual-franchise/">the games</a> were released on multiple platforms, as well as simultaneous worldwide releases. Not only that but remasters and spin-off titles have helped the franchises exponentially. This doesn't come as much of a surprise, as for most gamers, Persona 5 and the other Persona 5 spin-offs really helped bring the franchise to the forefront and introduced people to the series as a whole.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the Persona 5 series alone sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Again, this is a statement that doesn't come as much of a surprise, especially considering how many games are in the Persona 5 series alone. In total, there are five titles in the Persona 5 series, with another game called Persona 5: The Phantom X due to be released in the near future. The Open Beta for this title began in April 2024, but there haven't been too many updates since then. Compared to the other games in the Persona 5 franchise, this one won't be as much of a mainstay as others, as only some of the original staff from the first Persona 5 game are working on this game, and it's marketed as a gacha game for the most part.</p>
<p>This year also saw the release of Persona 3 Reload, and then ATLUS branched out and created Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is a game that has a similar art style to that of Persona and has also done significantly well. Whether we'll see remakes of the original Persona games that started off the franchise remains to be seen, as we've seen some of the older games get ported to other platforms, like Persona 4 Golden, which was released last year.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like this franchise is going to continue to be massively successful for Sega and Atlus.</p>

			<p>With Grand Theft Auto VI, Rockstar Games has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior while offering players more freedom than before, according to a former developer of the game.</p>
<p>Speaking With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GTAVI-oclock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTAVIoclock</a>, former game designer at Rockstar Games, commented on the next entry in the open-world series launching next year, saying that the developer has raised the bar again in terms of realism and NPC behavior, which will blow everyone away and will be talked about many years after launch. The former developer also talked about mission design, saying that it will be what makes the game good, granting players freedom. As for the current state of the game, Grand Theft Auto VI is in the bug-fixing phase, so hopefully, it won't take much longer to see more of it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ex-Rockstar Designer Interview  - GTA VI O'clock - Episode 47" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R5mzJsGhmr4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been almost a year since we last saw Grand Theft Auto VI, thanks to its official announcement trailer, which provided a very quick look at the two protagonists and the state of Leonida, where Vice City is located. Since then, Rockstar Games has been pretty silent about the game, leaving plenty of room for rumors and speculation regarding its precise release date, which hasn't slipped to 2026 as of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">September</a>, leaving fans plenty of time to put together documents going over everything that is currently known about what will be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time, according to analysts.</a></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It will be released sometime next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-biggest-update-to-date-is-out-now-adding-new-npcs-animal-companions-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of Enshrouded, Keen Games has been nonstop on adding quality-of-life changes to the game and major content updates for the title to keep it fresh in the Early Access period. When it comes to value for money, Enshrouded is undoubtedly it. Today, the fourth content update, Souls of the Frozen Frontier, is out and available. This is their biggest update yet and adds a ton of new content to explore, as well as bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. The full 1.0 launch of Enshrouded is edging ever closer, as the full release is planned for 2025 on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. This title has been in Early Access since <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/">January 2024</a>, and Keen Games is showing no signs of slowing down. If you are getting stuck into the latest update, there is a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of the new update, Keen Games has released two videos to show off the features, with one being a general trailer and the other being a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpK-BZdngOc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature spotlight</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enshrouded - Souls of the Frozen Frontier | Official Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PogZ1u9mGSM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First and foremost, there is now a new region to explore named the Albaneve Summits. Here, you'll get to experience the brand-new dynamic weather system, which will be featured throughout the entirety of Embervale and will take you through snowy tundras, ice plains, and plenty of new quests. The Summit is home to a lot of new monsters and creatures, as well as materials that you can bring back to your base and use for crafting.</p>
<p>For some, the most important things that are being added to Enshrouded are pets and farm animals. You can now have furry friends to keep you company at base. Anything non-aggressive can be tamed, and you can then help escort them back to your base. To make sure they're safe and happy, you can provide them with a home and some treats to keep them happy. If you are keeping farm animals, they will also drop resources that you can use every once in a while.</p>
<p>That's not all, as there are also new NPCs that you can find throughout Embervale, which can now be asked to return with you to your base to assist with crafting recipes and other tasks. Along with this comes new armor sets that you can equip to remain fashionable as you explore the expansive world of Enshrouded, with the player level cap now being increased to level 35 in the new update. This will allow you to access new spells, skills, and additional perks to help you survive the frozen areas of Embervale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-reckons-the-idea-of-an-exclusive-is-disappearing-altogether/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Final Fantasy XVI producer and Final Fantasy XIV director Naoki Yoshida was recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/811/G081112/20241010055/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the Japanese website 4Gamer alongside series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to discuss the upcoming game <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-neo-dimension-launches-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, which will be available next month on PC and consoles after an exclusive debut on Apple Arcade.</span></p>
<p>When asked whether he'd ever want to make a game for Apple's platform, Yoshida-san replied that in his mind, the idea of a platform exclusive is disappearing altogether.</p>
<p><em>Now the biggest gaming platform is the PC, and with the streaming boom, PC-based gamers are becoming mainstream. But on the other hand, smart devices are becoming a platform that everyone has for the younger generation. Given that, if possible, it would be better to make it playable on any platform rather than making it for a specific platform in order to reach a much larger audience. With that as a basic idea, I decide whether the game I'm trying to make will run properly on smart devices.</em><br>
<em>If the parts that can't be run are equal to the fun of the game, I'll give up on smart devices and make it fun. On the other hand, if it fits within the specs and can be played without the device getting too hot to touch, it's definitely better to make it for smart devices as well. In my mind, the idea of ​​a platform exclusive is disappearing altogether.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI certainly suffered from that. It was only available on PlayStation 5 for over a year, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-fell-short-high-end-sales-goal-slow-ps5-adoption-blamed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led</a> to weak sales, similar to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Now, Square Enix has largely <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-unveils-new-business-plan-with-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-and-quality-over-quantity-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> to a multiplatform strategy that will take Xbox into much greater account. Yoshida reiterates the shift later in the aforementioned interview:</p>
<p><em>This time, we will also release the Xbox Series X|S version (of FANTASIAN: Neo Dimension) at the same time. In the future, Square Enix titles will be released simultaneously on each platform more and more, but since this is close to the first release, we would like Xbox users to play it as well.</em></p>
<p>Xbox fans are hoping Square Enix will eventually bring Final Fantasy XVI to their favorite platform, too, after the recent debut on PC.</p>
