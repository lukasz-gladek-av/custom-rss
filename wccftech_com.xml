			<p>Battlefield 6's unique destruction mechanics are not possible on a generic engine like Unreal Engine 5, but this is only one reason why the series will hardly leave the Frostbite Engine behind.</p>



<p>Speaking with Spanish publication <a href="https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/battlefield-2025/noticias/que-hacemos-no-posible-motor-generico-padres-battlefield-6-dicen-no-a-hacer-maletas-seguir-moda-industria">3DJuegos</a>, Senior Producer David Sirland commented on the possibility of the series ever switching to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine</a>, saying that the destruction mechanics seen in Battlefield 6 are not possible on a generic engine, as the Frostbite Engine is tailor-made for the new entry in the series and its features as much as the studio is tailoring the game itself for the engine. Achieving similar results on a generic game engine, pushing it to the limit, is achievable, Sirland added, but the developers are specialists with the engine, and he thinks this shows in the game. The Frostbite Engine being tailor-made for Battlefield 6 and the game itself being tailored for the engine isn't the only reason why the franchise is unlikely to leave its current engine behind, as the development studios are used to Frostbite and have engineers knowledgeable about the engine, which allows them to work in harmony, according to Producer Alexia Christofi, something that would likely require a lot of time to achieve with an engine switch.</p>



<p>Soon enough, players worldwide will be able to get a first, proper taste of Battlefield 6 ahead of its launch this October. The open beta, which is now available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">pre-load</a>, will allow players to test out the game this weekend from August 9 to August 10 and from August 14 to August 17. The open beta includes, for the first weekend, the Iberian Offense, Liberation Peak, and Siege of Cairo maps, and a selection of play modes, including Conquest, Breakthrough, Domination, and King of the Hill.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10. You can tide yourself over while waiting for the open beta to go live by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">first impressions</a> on the game.</p>

			<p>Genshin Impact will drop PlayStation 4 support due to hardware limitations and platform application size, developer HoYoverse confirmed today.</p>



<p>The game's PlayStation 4 support will be phased out gradually, starting with the game's removal from the PlayStation Store on September 10. All those who have already downloaded the game will be able to continue playing until April 8, 2026, when service will officially end. From February 25, however, the experience will be somewhat limited with the removal of all in-game purchases, but everything that's been purchased but not yet claimed can still be obtained until the end of service in early April.</p>



<p>As technical reasons are behind the termination of PlayStation 4 support, it's unsurprising that the system requirements for the PC and mobile versions have increased. Devices below the system requirements will still be able to run the game after the Song of the Welkin Moon update launches, but users playing on devices with specs lower than the minimum may experience performance and stability issues. Still, the <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408846">increased requirements</a> are not particularly high, especially the PC requirements, so most players should have no trouble playing the game even after the Song of the Welkin Moon.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-will-include-bots-when-servers-aren%E2%80%99t-full-classic-maps-will-be-introduced-based-on-fan-feedback.1263117/</guid>

			<p>In an interview <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Taiwanese website GNN</a> at the Hong Kong Battlefield 6 reveal event, Development Director Anna Narrevik shared some juicy details about the upcoming first-person shooter game.</p>



<p>The first one is that the game will support bots, automatically adding them to a multiplayer match whenever a server is not full of regular players.</p>



<p><em>The way the game uses AI is that when the server is not full, AI will be added to fill the gap.</em></p>



<p>Of course, players could join at any time to take over from bots. Still, this is a somewhat controversial design choice that is sure to leave at least a few disgruntled fans. At the same time, it's probably for the best, as Battlefield matches need to be filled at all times to feel truly as epic as they are meant to be.</p>



<p>Narrevik also commented on the addition of further classic maps post-launch:</p>



<p><em>It won't be available in today's event, but there will be a Firestorm map in Battlefield 6 in the future . It's a classic map. We'll introduce classic versions or maps based on fan or player requests. Of course, we have so many options, and we want to choose the best possible one to bring back the good old days of playing Battlefield.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Development Director confirmed that fans can expect regular quarterly updates. Additionally, she expressed her preference for the improved tactical destruction as the game's best feature:</p>



<p><em>For me, it's really about tactical destruction, because it can suddenly change the battlefield. For example, if you see a building suddenly collapse, it gives you new ways to play and new opportunities to face the enemy. Not only does it look good, but it also gives you more combat options and more control.</em></p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta officially starts on Saturday, August 9, but early access begins tomorrow. Preload <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already available</a> on all platforms. The game will be released on October 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In February 2024, Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games to create a persistent universe within Fortnite based on its own franchises: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, and more.</p>



<p>We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> a bit about that project from Epic Games Executive Vice President Saxs Persson:</p>



<p><em>Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we’ve built. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience. We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to be able to flow between a Fortnite experience, a Disney experience, or any experience really.</em></p>



<p>Now, though, the Wall Street Journal has <a href="https://www.tovima.com/wsj/is-it-still-disney-magic-if-its-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a report</a> that cites anonymous sources within Epic who allegedly are disgruntled with the speed of the collaboration. According to the report, the project is codenamed Bulldog, but it is being slowed down by Disney's requirement for signoffs 'from so many divisions' before proceeding. </p>



<p>However, Epic founder and president Tim Sweeney has countered this claim. Posting on X, he set the record straight on the matter:</p>



<p><em>The anonymous quote is BS. The speed of Disney and Epic collaborations like Darth Vader has been awesome and is around 10x the ordinary speed of media company dealings in this business. We even provided a statement to the writer of this article saying so, but they chose not to print it.</em></p>



<p>Sweeney did not, however, appear to counter the report's claim that the Fortnite x Disney project is targeting a Fall 2026 release window 'at the earliest'. </p>
