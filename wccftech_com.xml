			<p>The function of the Nintendo Switch 2 new Joy-Con controller C button has yet to be officially revealed, but there's the chance that we will get to celebrate the unexpected return of the Wii U console when it will, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s"> eXstas1s</a>, who proved to be an overall reliable insider in the past, revealed that, according to their sources, the C button will be used, among other things, to connect the Nintendo Switch 2 to an original Switch console to use it as a controller or an additional screen, essentially turning the previous generation console into something akin to the Wii U GamePad. As not every Nintendo Switch 2 user may also be the owner of its predecessor, there's no doubt that this connectivity feature will be completely optional, but, on the other hand, it could open up some very interesting possibilities, such as proper emulation of Nintendo DS and 3DS games.</p>
<p><iframe title="BOOM ☄️ XBOX + STEAM : ÚLTIMA Hora 🥵 SWITCH 2 Botón C: ASÍ FUNCIONA 🤔 JUEGOS de PS5 en NINTENDO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2QbjzzdVj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While eXstas1s has proven to be somewhat reliable in the past, we have to take this Nintendo Switch 2 rumor with a grain of salt until the C button functionality is officially revealed next week. At the same time, a patent that emerged online<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dual-screen-patent/"> earlier this month</a> suggested some sort of dual-screen functionality for the system, so the ability to use the original Switch as a second screen doesn't sound all that improbable.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches later this year worldwide. The console's release date is expected to be revealed next week during a dedicated Nintendo Direct.</p>

			<p><span>Despite burgeoning budgets and development teams growing to the dozens, if not hundreds, the AA gaming space is something where it’s rare to see a developer thrive. MercurySteam has been crafting up a variety of third-person adventure titles over the years, and we recently went hands-on with their latest adventure, slated to release in just two months. <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blades of Fire</a> is one of those titles that might sound average on paper but certainly holds its own with the right tempering.</span></p>
<p><span>After a brief backstory introducing the world of Blades of Fire, from the world once ruled by mighty giants known as The Forgers to an evil Queen whose magic can turn steel into stone, the lore of iron and blood runs deep through this adventure’s DNA. Players pick up the hammer of Aran de Lira, a commander’s son and subsequent blacksmith whose character designs can only be described as a down-on-his-luck Gabriel Belmont. After a brief introduction, Blades of Fire introduces the plucky sidekick Adso and an abbot whose screen time lasts a mere couple of sentences before his life is cut short, yet serves as the catalyst to send this duo on an adventure to slay the merciless Queen. It’s just enough to set the mood before Aran de Lira and his new travel buddy venture out, accompanied by a travel montage and a brief tutorial on weapon crafting.</span></p>
<p><span>Weapon crafting seems to be the main hook to Blades of Fire, setting it apart from other character action titles. By venturing back to The Forge between worlds, players can first pick out a learned recipe and put it together with the various ores and woods that have been wicked up during the journey; naturally, I only had access to the very bottom tier of materials given that I was playing from a fresh save file. Once all the materials are acquired and distributed, a separate mini-game plays out where the player has to hammer out any impurities and even out the thickness of metal to match the shape of the blade.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a strange system where I had to select a portion of the blade on a sliding scale and then slide the intensity up and down to impact not just that particular section of the blade but also by raising and lowering the surrounding regions. It was not a system that led itself to being too intuitive to crafting a perfectly even blade and I spent too much time just trying to even out the peaks and trying to come as close as I could to the intended shape of the blade. Initially, this doesn’t seem to do much for the blade beyond raising its core stats like damage and durability, but there were other mechanics on offer, such as changing the type and material of the handle or additional flourishes and accessories to the weapon. The Forge itself feels like the main source of progression throughout Aran de Lira’s journey and the ability to customize every minute stat to a particular weapon might end to some interesting builds for crafting.</span></p>
<p><span>Blades of Fire also features an interesting combat system where attacks are done across all four face buttons and determine where Aran’s strikes will land. You don’t often see games that map body parts to a specific button, so it took some time to get used to aiming for an enemy’s left arm versus its right if it happened to be less armored in that location. Aran can wield two separate blades in combat and swap between the two. Each weapon can deal damage between slashing, blunt and piercing attacks, with some offering up multiple damage types. There’s an obvious effectiveness system at play where different body parts on an enemy will glow in colors from red to green that show how effectively a particular weapon or damage type works. </span></p>
<p><span>As much as players might want to forge an unstoppable sword and carry it through the adventure, the weapon's effectiveness coupled with a durability system for every weapon means that routine trips to The Forge will be required. As is typical of most action RPGs these days, combat is driven through a stamina system that dwindles down quickly through dodges and repeated attacks. It does recover on its own, but Aran de Lira can hold down L2 and go into a defensive position and recover at a faster rate.</span></p>

<p><span>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies when Blades of Fire launches on May 22nd across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and the Epic Games Store.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-desert-console-getting-native-ps5-xss-x-versions-on-june-26-dropping-ps4-xbox-one/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Pearl Abyss announced that Black Desert console will be updated with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously confirmed</a> native versions for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X consoles on June 26. The community had been waiting a long time; it has been well over four years since those consoles launched, after all. The caveat is that the game won't be playable on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One anymore after that date.</p>
<p>The General Manager <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YlGGwrWCBU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>Black Desert console was first introduced in 2019 with the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and this month <a href="https://wccftech.com/cross-play-between-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-now-live-in-black-desert-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the fifth anniversary of crossplay</a>. In our previous commentary video, we've mentioned that we are preparing for a native gen port with the goal of releasing an update in the first half of this year. We'd like to share that platform certification for both PlayStation 5 and Xbox series versions is progressing as planned. While there is a possibility of some schedule changes depending on the certification status, if all processes are completed smoothly, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions will be available on June 26.</em></p>
<p><em>As mentioned previously, the update will be provided at no additional cost while we are excited to bring this update to our community. Following the porting update, Black Desert console will be transitioning to a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series exclusive service. Consequently, gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available. Rest assured your game data will be safely stored your account information and all entitlements to Black Desert will be fully accessible when you're ready to transition to the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series version of your console.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you. However, as we mentioned in </em><em>our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly </em><em>difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly. We kindly ask for your understanding and </em><em>offer our sincerest apologies for this decision that is made with the long-term growth of Black Desert console in mind. </em></p>
<p><em>We believe that the transition to a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series exclusive service will be an important first step in providing a better gaming environment from Black Desert console. </em><em>Performance improvements involve many different factors, so it might be difficult to notice immediate changes in old areas but we will continue working to address the limitations experienced on the older generation consoles. Furthermore, we are planning updates for</em><br>
<em>various content that you have all been waiting for.</em></p>
