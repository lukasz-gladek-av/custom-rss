			<p><a href="https://kalshi.com/">Kalshi</a>, the US prediction market and market trading platform where millions of people bet on major global and cultural events, including things like <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards">what the game of the year will be this year at The Game Awards 2025</a> has crossed a cultural milestone by appearing in an ad for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The ad is a live-action mock-up of fictional news cycles that follow the events of the narrative in Black Ops 7, and at about halfway through the short teaser trailer, a shot of a Kalshi query regarding whether robots will replace human soldiers in the US military is spotted with 76% of fictional bets voting yes, and the remaining 24% saying no.</p>



<p>Kalshi shared the trailer from its official account on X (formerly Twitter), writing, "<em>Kalshi *hands shake emoji* Call of Duty. Prediction markets and culture are now one.</em>"</p>



<p>There are several claims online that Kalshi has partnered with Activision in some way, but there's no official word from either company that the partnership is any deeper than Kalshi appearing in the trailer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>That said, the prediction market's appearance alone is of some significance, as it's another layer of cultural integration for the platform that hasn't yet been seen, especially at such a high scale as this.</p>



<p>We'll provide an update if it becomes clear that there is a deeper partnership here. In the meantime, you can expect to see more of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this coming week, starting on Tuesday, August 19, at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-resident-evil-ghost-of-yotei-fallout-tv-ninja-gaiden-4/">Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese developer Hero Games, an early investor in Game Science's Black Myth Wukong, announced its own game, CrisisX. It's a post-apocalyptic open world survival crafting game in development for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512880/CrisisX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and mobile devices (Android, iOS) with a launch window estimated in Q2 2026.</p>



<p>In CrisisX, players will explore a massive 1,200-km² open world with up to 5K other players on a single server. This big map features 12 distinct terrains, ranging from Western-style towns and hidden laboratories to snowy mountaintops. Each terrain is filled with unique items, vegetation, resources, and wild animals to discover, collect, and hunt.</p>



<p>According to Hero Games, CrisisX boasts a versatile combat system that offers an array of weapons, including machetes, crossbows, pistols, sniper rifles, machine guns, RPGs, and grenades. They'll need them, too, as the ruined game world is populated by dangerous zombie-like Infected NPCs, including hordes and 'Titan mutants'. Players can even build armored vehicles like M2 Bradleys or WWII-era M4 Sherman tanks to fight over vital resources like oil wells.</p>



<p>To better resist in this harsh world, players may join forces in teams, groups, and communes to seize strategic resource points and expand their territories. While unity offers a better chance of survival against the Infected Hordes and brutal elements, it also inevitably leads to bigger, more bitter turf wars between rival groups. Beyond combat, as befitting a survival game, players must manage their characters' hunger, thirst, and health; every physical activity impacts their strength and attributes.</p>



<p>CrisisX also includes home-building features that players can use to claim territory on the open world multiplayer map and then expand into a bigger, badder homestead with fences, farms, livestock, and more that can repel the Infected. But it isn't just NPCs you need to worry about, as other survivors can raid your home at any time.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-last-of-us-multiplayer/">The Last of Us Online</a> was a project that many fans of the series were excited about, since there are still people who, to this day, play the Factions multiplayer mode that launched with the original game in 2013. But Naughty Dog decided it <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/">didn't want to be a multiplayer-focused studio, and ended up cancelling the project</a> after years of development work, to the disappointment of fans, and the developers at Naughty Dog who worked on the project and saw its potential.</p>



<p>Including the former game director on the project at Naughty Dog, Vinit Agarwal, who, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">Game*Spark</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/">VGC</a>), spoke about how one of the reasons he left after a decade with the studio was that he saw "<em>the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer," </em>after his time working on The Last of Us Online and every other project he was on at Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>"<em>My main titles were Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part 2</em>. <em>I worked on both multiplayer and single-player.</em> <em>I was mainly in charge of boss battles, and Naughty Dog’s boss battles are generally one-on-one situations. So I wanted players to feel like they were fighting a human player, not an AI, even in single-player. To be more specific, I worked on the final boss in A Thief’s End and the fight between Ellie and Abby in The Last of Us Part II. I used all my knowledge of multiplayer to create the feeling that you were fighting a human. A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer.</em>"</p>



<p>Agarwal has set up a new international studio between the United States and Japan with another Naughty Dog alumnus, writer and former creative director Joe Pettinati, who will be running the US office, while Agarwal will be based in Japan. The official name of the studio has yet to be announced.</p>



<p>This new title, which Agarwal described as "<em>triple-indie</em>," is still early in its development, only being a few months along at the time of this writing. </p>



<p>"<em>There’s not much we can say yet, but the new game is a multiplayer game, and we aim to bring the cinematic action we’ve been familiar with from our previous titles to multiplayer</em>," said Agarwal. "<em>We’re already in contact with partners, and we expect to have more information to share in the future</em>."</p>



<p>Whatever Agarwal and Pettinati are working on, it won't look like The Last of Us Online, and it certainly won't feature anything copyrighted by Sony, but it could potentially be the multiplayer game that Factions fans were hoping to play before the official project was shut down. </p>
