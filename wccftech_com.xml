			<p>MercurySteam's upcoming action/adventure game has received several new gameplay videos from a few outlets who were able to play it in advance of its release. It certainly looks like there's some inspiration from Sony Santa Monica's God of War Norse mythology reboot.</p>
<p>Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling</a> in late February, this game has received a barrage of news ahead of its May 22 launch. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about the game's focus on forging and wielding melee weapons rather than using flashy magic spells. Likewise, they wanted to put the player's skill first rather than rely on RPG-like stats. However, the weapon's stats will matter, depending on the materials you used while crafting it. There are many different combinations to experiment with.</p>
<p>Later, the Spanish team known for the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow trilogy <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full PC system requirements for Blades of Fire:</p>

<p>In this game, players will step into the role of Aran de Lira, firstborn of the King's Ward and the only one capable of crafting weapons to challenge the evil Queen Nerea, who has cast a spell that turns all other steel weapons into stone. Forging is a big part of the game, allowing players to choose from seven weapon families and more than thirty unique Forge scrolls. In combat, they'll be able to target specific body parts, and wielding the right weapon against the enemy's armor will be critical. There are over fifty enemy types in total, each with different attack styles, weapons, and armors.</p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be released soon for PC (as an Epic Games Store exclusive), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
