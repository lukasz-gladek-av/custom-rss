			<div><p>As new information regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's mass layoffs</a> continues to trickle out online, the first reported project casualty appears to be Rare's next major title, Everwild, which <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyeysnjmk24">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a>, and others are now reporting has been cancelled as part of the cuts. </p><p>Everwild was first publicly announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/">2019</a>, and has reportedly been in the works for the better part of a decade. Just months prior to this reported cancellation, Microsoft's chief executive officer of its gaming division, Phil Spencer, commented on Everwild, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-making-good-progress-confirms-phil-spencer/">saying that it was "<em>making good progress</em>."</a> Now, it seems, we'll never know what that progress looked like, or get to see what Everwild would have become.</p><p>Which is unfortunate, though, that being said, its cancellation comes as less of a shock considering the reports regarding its development journey. It had previously been <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/">described as a "<em>real mess</em>,"</a> due in part to the fact that when Everwild was revealed in 2019, Rare wasn't entirely sure what kind of game it was due to become. </p><p>The visuals featured in its reveal trailer and in media presented following the announcement always captivated players, but the question around what kind of game it was going to be was never entirely answered.</p></div>

<div><p>Regardless, Rare is one of the industry's most iconic and respected studios for good reason. Whatever Everwild was going to become, players would have expected an incredible game, because that's what Rare is known for making.</p><p>Which only compounds the news of the game's cancellation, because it also means that Rare will lose some of its talented employees. Details around how many are being laid off remain unclear, as Microsoft is seemingly drip-feeding the news of just how many people have been impacted. According to reports, a total of 9,000 people across Microsoft are being laid off today.</p></div>
