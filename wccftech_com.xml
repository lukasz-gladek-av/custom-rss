			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-would-like-to-add-a-map-editor-a-single-player-experience-and-more/">1047 Games</a>, the studio behind Splitgate and Splitgate 2, whose co-founder boldly proclaimed from the Summer Game Fest 2025 stage that Splitgate 2 will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">"<em>make FPS great again</em>,"</a> admitted that they have <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/building-the-splitgate-you-deserve">launched Splitgate 2 "<em>too early</em>,"</a> and have announced that the studio will undergo a massive overhaul of the game before re-launching sometime in early 2026. Alongside this announcement was the reveal that the studio is laying off more members of the development team, and the servers for the original Splitgate are getting shutdown next month.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 officially launched on June 6, 2025, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and though it'll still be playable for the foreseeable future and will still get the upcoming Chapter 3 update, 1047 Games has effectively announced that it has 'unlaunched' the game, and is bringing it back to a beta state. </p>



<p>"<em>We've heard your feedback, and we agree with you,</em>" the studio writes in its statement, which was published on its website and to the game's official account on X and attributed to co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian. "<em>We launched too early. We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly, we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with. So we're going back to beta. We'll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>That means reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more, which we'll share soon</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To the Splitgate community,</p><p>We believe in Splitgate 2. This game means everything to us – it's been our life for almost 10 years, starting in our dorm room, and we're more committed than ever to delivering the incredible experience you deserve.</p><p>We’ve heard your feedback, and we…</p></div>— Splitgate 2 (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The statement goes on to confirm that the studio is laying off more staff, with 45 people <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown?utm_source=threads,twitter">reportedly</a> losing their jobs at 1047 Games, and so that the cuts don't impact the team too heavily, OG-Splitgate is getting its servers shut down "<em>in a month.</em>" </p>



<p>1047 Games says that though it would love to keep those servers online, "<em>it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team.</em>" It is however "<em>exploring the possibility</em>" of creating an offline mode and/or peer-to-peer matches, so that dedicated fans of the first Splitgate game can still play it beyond the shutdown.</p>



<p>The studio also promises to have "<em>a dedicated experience in Splitgate 2 that delivers on the promise of the original,</em>" when Splitgate 2 re-launches in 2026. </p>



<p>"<em>We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes,</em>" the statement reads as it begins to conclude. "<em>But we've learned a lot and</em> <em>are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up. We love this game and we love this community too much to ever quit. So we won't</em>."</p>



<p>After 1047 Games launched with all the confidence in the world, it's clear that it was sorely misguided when Splitgate 2 officially launched last month, which players knew without the studios' co-founders having to admit it. There are still plenty of questions regarding what the changes will be exactly, how the game will still be playable, whether it will now appear as 'Splitgate 2 - Open Beta' on consoles and PC, and when exactly the OG-Splitgate servers will be taken offline.</p>



<p>It's all together not at all what 1047 Games envisioned when they were looking ahead at Splitgate 2's launch earlier this year. By the time the studio is ready to re-launch the game next year, it'll be interesting to see if anyone is still waiting around for 1047 to "<em>make FPS great again</em>," and if anyone will even care that it's back after what's been a mixed bag of a first launch, to say the least.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/borderlands-4-everything-we-know-return-og-looter-shooter/">Borderlands 4</a> is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/">September 12, 2025</a>, but that's not the date that it'll be arriving on Nintendo Switch 2. Gearbox needs a little bit more time with that version of the game, and today, Gearbox president, Randy Pitchford, announced the separate release date in a video posted to X.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though he hams it up as if the Nintendo Switch 2 version won't make it in 2025, the actual launch date for Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 is October 3, 2025, making its release arrive a week and change less than a month from its arrival on other platforms.</p>



<p>"<em>Look, I know we promised that the game would come inside of 2025,"</em> Pitchford began<em>. "We promised that it would come before the end of the year, and...game development is very hard.</em> <em>But I do have an update for you, we do have a date now. We have a date for the Nintendo Switch 2 version, of Borderlands 4</em>. <em>You guys, that date...that date is...October 3! It's October 3 you guys! It's not next year, it's not even the holiday, it's so much before Christmas, it's so much before Thanksgiving, it's October 3 you guys, wooo! *horn noise.* I'm psyched, I'm psyched. Get it!</em>"</p>



<p>Compared to the rest of the platforms, it'll be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 performs on the Switch 2, and though it's perhaps a bit upsetting for Switch 2 owners that they'll have to wait nearly a month after everyone else can get their hands on Borderlands 4 to play it themselves, they'll at least be able to see the beginnings of whether Gearbox is able to deliver on its promise that the endgame in Borderlands 4 is the<a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-series-best-endgame-yet-gearbox/"> "<em>best endgame</em>"</a> in the series so far.</p>



<p>Especially if the Switch 2 version is somehow more expensive than the other versions of the game. That's not likely to happen, but with all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/">issues that Borderlands 4 has had around pricing</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">Pitchford having to apologize</a> for telling fans that even if it had ended up being $80, they should have found a way to pay it, the last thing this game needs is another pricing controversy.</p>
