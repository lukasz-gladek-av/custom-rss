			<p>The sports game that everyone has been waiting for is finally going into Early Access on PC on March 20, 2025. Wreckfest 2, a title that will have extreme full-contact racing and chaos, will be bigger and better than ever. The developers stated that the physics engine has been significantly overhauled so that the crashes are more intense than ever and deeper component damage. Of course, there will be the iconic mayhem of the races that everyone loves, but now it's even more detailed than before. This title was one of the most highly anticipated racing and sports games in<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/"> our 2025 round-up</a>.</p>
<p>For those who want to see what they can expect from Wreckfest 2's Early Access period, make sure to check out the trailer below to see some of the adrenaline rushes you can experience in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>High-speed circuits make a return, and you'll even get to race and crash through a junkyard, which can make for some intense collisions. More than that, you'll also get to try and attempt some serious jumps, which can help you get ahead of the opponent while weaving through oncoming traffic at busy intersections. Compared to other racing games, Wreckfest 2 is a game where no rules apply, and it's every driver for themselves. You will be racing against up to 23 other players or AI drivers, depending on what you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Instead of sparkly supercars to race through the tracks, the cars you choose will be patchwork jobs full of dents, rust, and broken parts to really add to the grime and grittiness of Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>Early Access will continue to progress and add new content, and during this time, you'll be able to build your very own car from the ground up and turn it into a force to be reckoned with. There will be new cars added to the game, as well as other vehicles to come in the future as the game continues to develop and evolve.</p>
<p>Consumer feedback is essential to the developers during the Early Access period and will all be taken on board so that it can be refined and reshaped as needed during Early Access.</p>
<p>For those on PC and want to get stuck into Wreckfest 2, make sure to wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> so you'll be notified when the game officially enters the Early Access period on PC.</p>

			<p>NEOWIZ and Wolfeye Studios have partnered up to bring players a brand new Retro Sci-fi First-Person Action RPG. NEOWIZ will be responsible for publishing this title and supporting Wolfeye Studios through the development process. So far, the game has yet to be named, but what we do know is that the game will be set in a retrofuturistic setting with a branching narrative. It's also an ambitious new IP, which Wolfeye originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/weird-west-developer-gets-investment-for-its-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received funding for a couple of years ago</a> via venture capital fund Galaxy Interactive.</p>
<p>As a celebration of the partnership news, Wolfeye Studios has released some of their concept art for the upcoming title. There are three images to showcase the world that players will get to explore, from dusty desert towns to built-up elegant interiors. The images chosen are being used to show how diverse the world will be, combining rugged environments with futuristic style to create a unique experience for the audience.</p>

<p>Wolfeye Studios' team leaders are Raf Colantonio and Julien Roby, who worked on Dishonored and Prey. They are joined by industry veterans who worked with them on those two titles and some of the developers working on Dark Messiah, Pentiment, and Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>Wolfeye Studios is now working hard to create this RPG title, which will be released on PC and console. <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The team</a> at Wolfeye Studios works from more than 10 different cities around the world, working across seven different time zones on four different continents. In 2022, Wolfeye Studios released its first game, "Weird West," which went on to be nominated for BEST RPG of the Year at the annual D.I.C.E. Awards. It also got an eight out of ten score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>.</p>
<p>"We have a burning passion for making a very specific type of game that blends RPG, action and simulation. These games can only be successful when the publisher shares that same passion," says Raf Colantonio, Creative Director and President of Wolfeye Studios.</p>
<p>NEOWIZ has released some very well-known titles over the years, <span>the most recent being the award-winning title&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a>, which is set to get a DLC sometime this year. The South Korean company most recently announced a partnership with ZAKAZANE, a studio consisting</span>&nbsp;of CD Projekt Red and 11 Bit Studios alumni.</p>
