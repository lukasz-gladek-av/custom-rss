			<p>Roleplaying games have been on an incredible winning streak lately. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">2024 was a monumental year thanks to the release of some very high-quality games</strong></a>, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/"><strong>2025 has managed to keep that momentum going</strong></a>, proving that we are living in a golden age for RPGs. From long-awaited sequels that finally delivered on a decade of hype to new IPs that left their mark on the genre with involving narratives and engaging gameplay, this year was another filled with quality releases.</p>



<p>Because of this rich release line-up, narrowing this list down to just five games was more difficult than ever. Whether it was the revival of a cult classic, the perfection of a tactical formula, or a sprawling open world that actually felt lived-in, the RPGs of 2025 will be remembered for years to come.</p>

<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">9.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is undoubtedly one of the best role-playing games released in the current console generation</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 came out of nowhere. Developed by Sandfall Interactive, an unproven game development studio based in France, the game blew RPG enjoyers all over the world out of the water with its modernization of the classic turn-based JRPG formula.</p>



<p>Featuring one of the best stories and characters in years, a challenging combat system incorporating action game elements for enhanced interactivity, and a soundtrack that makes every sequence memorable,  Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 quickly became a smashing success, its high quality recognized by the entire industry with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/"><strong>Game of the Year award</strong></a> at this year's The Game Awards.</p>



<p>All the praise the game received is absolutely deserved, as I noted in my review: <em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-10">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II improves the foundation set by the first entry in the series in every possible way</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite being a little rough around the edges, the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance quickly became the open-world RPG to play for those looking to live a medieval life in a living, breathing digital world. Topping this was a difficult task, but Warhorse Studios not only met expectations but also exceeded them with Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.</p>



<p>The continuation of Henry of Skalitz's story not only impresses with the refinement of many of the mechanics seen in the original, or with the sheer size of the new 15th-century Bohemia map (almost double that of the first game), but with its density. The game is chock-full of little events, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-talks-about-dynamic-npc-routines-and-emergent-storytelling-for-side-quests/"><strong>NPCs' reactions</strong></a>, discoveries, and easter eggs, making it easy to lose oneself in what, to date, is the most lively open-world seen in role-playing games.</p>



<p>In his review of the game, Chris Wray could only praises such an excellent RPG:<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> "Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-9">Elden Ring Nightreign (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">9</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Elden-Ring-Nightreign-key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign is a great example of how to adapt an established formula into something both new and engaging</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the immense success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a>, there was little doubt that the open-world game would become the first entry in a series, much like the original Dark Souls. While a sequel has yet to be announced, the franchise was expanded in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"><strong>a rather unexpected way with Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></a>.</p>



<p>On paper, FromSoftware's new foray into a multiplayer-focused experience does not sound particularly compelling, as a shrinking playable zone and resetting character progression seem to be completely antithetical to the Souls series formula. However, this combination of high-speed gameplay, co-op, and roguelite mechanics comes together extremely well, making the game a showcase of how to leverage an established experience to offer something different.</p>



<p>I wasn't really convinced about the game before release, but after playing, I was hopelessly hooked, as I wrote in my review: <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-8-8">Avowed (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">8.8</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Avowed-key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Avowed stands as a great role-playing game enhanced by what Obsidian Entertainment does best</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/"><strong>Pillars of Eternity</strong></a> series, its world of Eora was expanded with Avowed, a first-person role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment to a high standard.</p>



<p>Set in a remote corner of the world to make the experience welcoming for newcomers, Avowed's strength lies in its narrative elements, rooted in the great writing the studio is known for. Gameplay still delivers with <a href="https://wccftech.com/extended-avowed-gameplay/"><strong>solid combat and progression system</strong></a>, but lacks the same vibrancy of other open-world RPGs like The Elder Scrolls series, whose fifth entry Skyrim served as originally inspiration for the game, before its scope was toned down.</p>



<p>All of these elements come together well, making for a marked step forward from The Outer Worlds, as Alessio Palumbo noted in his review: <em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through. The visuals and performance are also praiseworthy. There are a few shortcomings, but if you're a fan of Western RPGs, you don't want to miss Avowed. It may have started as a spin-off, but it could go on to be the main series in Eora.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-9-5">Monster Hunter Wilds (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">9.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-Key-Art-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds evolves the series formula meaningfully with an open-world setting and new combat mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong>Monster Hunter World</strong></a>, expectations were high for Monster Hunter Wilds, especially for those who preferred World's approach to the series' gameplay over the much more action-oriented approach of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Although the community feels that these expectations were not met at launch, it's undeniable that Monster Hunter Wilds does most of what it sets out to do well. The open-world setting streamlines some of the series staples without dumbing them down, while the addition of Focus Mode helps hunters target certain monster body parts with every weapon type and makes hunts against some of the best-designed monsters in the series more spectacular than ever with the addition of a Wounds system.</p>



<p>With most of the launch complaints addressed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/"><strong>post-launch updates</strong></a>, Monster Hunter Wilds is now in a better state than at launch, and is now even more worthy of experiencing, as I highlighted in my review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Didn’t Predict It, But Rather A Future I Didn’t Desire’: Hideo Kojima Reflects on AI and the Haunting Legacy of Metal Gear Solid 2]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-didnt-predict-it-but-rather-a-future-i-didnt-desire-hideo-kojima-reflects-on-ai-and-the-haunting-legacy-of-metal-gear-solid-2/</link>

			<p>In many ways, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty was a game decades ahead of its time. Originally released in 2001, the title remained misunderstood for years, largely due to its controversial protagonist switch and a narrative that seemed to mirror its own predecessor excessively.</p>



<p>However, over the years, players have reevaluated the game as a chilling prophecy. Hideo Kojima appeared to predict a world where social media, information overload, and AI-driven control would reshape the fabric of society. Yet, according to the creator himself, this wasn't an act of prediction, but a warning.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA"><strong>In a new interview with Wired</strong></a>, Hideo Kojima was asked about AI gaining more control in the real world, just as seen in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and if he predicted that this era would come. <em>'Metal Gear Solid 2 is about digital society. In digital society, everything is preserved. It wasn't about AI, but interweaving digital data gaining a will of its own. When everyone is connected and exchanging opinions instantly, how does life change?"</em> Kojima-san explained.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"I didn't predict it, but rather a future I didn't desire,"</em> the legendary game creator concluded with a sobering thought.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hideo Kojima Answers Hideo Kojima Questions | Tech Support | WIRED" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02Ah5VQrzvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Despite his modesty, many remain unconvinced that Kojima doesn't possess a certain "prophetic" edge. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Death Stranding</strong></a>, for instance, famously launched just months before the COVID-19 pandemic turned its themes of isolation and "hero couriers" into a global reality, themes that were further expanded in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.</strong></a></p>



<p>As Kojima moves forward with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/if-you-watch-the-od-trailer-many-times-theres-a-hint-says-kojima-we-built-new-medium/"><strong>experimental horror project OD</strong></a> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/i-dont-know-if-this-will-work-out-hideo-kojima-comments-on-the-challenges-od-will-face/">so experimental Kojima-san doesn't know if it will work</a></strong>) and his return to "Espionage Action" with Physint (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">which is still very early in development</strong></a>), we have to wonder: which part of our future is he warning us about now?

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Think It’s Good to Have Limitations When You Are Creative’, Says Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Creator; No Plan to Scale Up]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> is a fantastic game in its own right, as exemplified by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review scores</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the prizes it's starting to win now</a> that the award season is in full swing, but it's all the more impressive because of Sandfall Interactive's small size. The French studio famously only has around 33 (yes, like the game) developers, and we also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that they made this gem <strong>with a budget of under $10 million</strong>.</p>



<p>As one of the biggest game releases of 2025 (according to the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final 2025 Alinea Analytics report</a>, the game reached <strong>8.6 million players</strong>, almost a million more than Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered), Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 certainly gives the studio the opportunity to scale up in size. However, in an interview <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Knowledge</a>, EDGE's free newsletter dedicated to the games industry, Sandfall Interactive founder, CEO, and Creative Director Guillaume Broche said <strong>there's no such plan</strong> despite the game performing 'a hundred times better' than they had anticipated, and he also explained why.</p>



<p><em>No, I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative. It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves. We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again.</em></p>



<p>It is definitely rare to see a game development studio getting the chance to expand and not take it. It may seem like an unusual choice at first, but it could prove extremely wise in the long run. By staying small, Sandfall won't be forced to follow the 'bigger is better' mentality, and it could also more easily cope with unsuccessful projects if need be. History shows that studios that double or even triple their size after a successful game can get into a lot of trouble if their next project goes wrong for whatever reason.</p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a substantial free update as a thank-you to the community, adding a new playable environment, new Luminas and weapons, a photo mode, and AMD FSR 4 support on PC, among other things. </p>

			<p>Visionary game designer and industry legend <strong>Hideo Kojima</strong> was recently featured <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Nikkei Xtrend</a>, where he <span>discussed, among various topics, the enigmatic upcoming&nbsp;<strong>OD</strong>&nbsp;Project once again</span>. As translated and reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gamesradar</a>, Kojima teased that the most recent teaser trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a> includes a 'hint' of some kind that players can discover after watching it carefully again and again.</p>



<p><em>I can't say anything else, or Mr Phil will be mad at me. But actually, if you watch the teaser trailer many times there's a hint. I really can't say what it is, but if you watch it 100 times… At the end of the trailer, it reads 'for all players and screamers'. That's also a big hint.</em></p>

<p>In the Nikkei Xtrend interview, Kojima also reiterated that it is a 'completely new medium' that his studio built with the help of <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which is publishing OD, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-kojima-partnership-brand-new-game-cloud-powered-xbox-bethesda-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase 2022.</p>



<p><em>I think when you first see OD, it looks like horror. But the system it uses isn't ordinary. Everything is made in a game engine, and a game is a game, but it's still a system like no other. That's why we built a completely new medium together with Microsoft.</em></p>



<p>OD <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being co-written with <strong>Jordan Peele</strong></a>, a filmmaker known for his horror works, and will feature Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, who sadly passed away last month before he could complete his motion performance in the game.</p>



<p>We know that it will leverage Xbox's cloud gaming technology, but we don't know how. Last year, Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that it was a risky project, and as of two weeks ago, he candidly <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-dont-know-if-this-will-work-out-hideo-kojima-comments-on-the-challenges-od-will-face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that he still doesn't know if it will work out or not in the end.</p>



<p>OD is supposed to be the studio's next project after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></strong> and before <strong>PHYSINT</strong>, a new Metal Gear Solid-like stealth IP that will be made <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in collaboration with PlayStation</a>.</p>

			<p>Polyphony Digital's <strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong> may have been released nearly four years ago, but according to series creator and studio founder Kazunori Yamauchi, it's still doing extremely well.</p>



<p>In an interview with media outlets that attended the Gran Turismo World Series 2025 World Finals in Fukuoka, Japan, the legendary game designer (and racing driver) revealed that the game <strong>is regularly played by over two million players each month</strong>, and perhaps even more importantly, its player base is still growing. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.gtplanet.net/gt7-2-million-monthly-users-20251221/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as GTPlanet reported it</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gran Turismo 7 has been released for several years, but still, the active users are currently over 2 million people, and the new users are increasing. The status that Gran Turismo 7 is in now is probably the best of any Gran Turismo titles that we’ve had in the past. We’ve never experienced this phenomenon before, and neither has PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Polyphony Digital experimented with live service in the previous entry, GT Sport, but it's clear that GT7 has received a much warmer welcome from series fans and continues to keep many players interested through various updates. The most recent one, Spec III (Update 1.65), launched on December 4 and introduced:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight cars (Ferrari 296 GT3 ’23, Ferrari 296 GTB ’22, FIAT Panda 30 CL ’85, Gran Turismo F3500‑B, Mine's BNR34 GT‑R N1 base, Mitsubishi FTO GP Version R ’97, Polestar 5 Performance ’26, and Renault Espace F1 ’95).</li>



<li>Two tracks (Yas Marina Circuit and Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve).</li>



<li>The new Data Logger feature lets players load data from the previous attempt or replays to view and compare data such as racing lines, throttle and brake inputs, speed, and engine RPM, all in real-time.</li>
</ul>



<p>Alongside Spec III, Gran Turismo 7 players can also purchase the new Power Pack for $29.99. This premium DLC adds 50 new races across 20 themed categories, such as 24-hour races, six unique cars specially tuned by Gran Turismo, tail-to-nose battles with <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-sophy-announced-by-sony-ai-and-polyphony-its-an-ai-breakthrough-capable-of-competing-against-top-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo Sophy</a> 3.0, and is bundled with 5,000,000 in-game Credits.</p>



<p>The game's only real downside is the aggressive microtransactions system, which also caused its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Wccftech review score</a> to drop from 9 to 8/10. From the point of view of PC players, there's also the 'downside' that the game still isn't available, whereas most other PlayStation exclusives have already been ported. </p>



<p>Three years ago, a Yamauchi statement about a PC version being considered <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was widely reported</a> in the press. However, a few weeks later, the founder of Polyphony rectified the statement, clarifying that the possibility was 'not zero' but that there was still nothing being actively done on that front yet. Unfortunately, as of the end of 2025, there are still no updates on the port.</p>
