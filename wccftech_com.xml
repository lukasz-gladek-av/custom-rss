			<p>This morning, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2010895134653837413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a new <strong>Resident Evil Showcase</strong> will air this <strong>Thursday, January 15</strong>, at 2 PM Pacific Time/5 PM Eastern Time/10 PM GMT/11 PM CET.</p>



<p>The stream will, of course, focus on <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, which is now just a month and a half away from its scheduled <strong>February 27</strong> launch date. However, there are hints that some other game may briefly appear, too. The official website says:</p>



<p><em>Don't miss the 12-minute Resident Evil Showcase special, featuring all the latest info on Resident Evil Requiem! Airing January 15, 2026!</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The date and time of the event may change without prior notice.</em></li>



<li><em>Some of the games included in the show aren't suitable for children.</em></li>



<li><em>This content will be age restricted. Age verification will be required to view this content.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Fans are hoping this means CAPCOM may take the opportunity and announce <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> ports of the <strong>Resident Evil 2 and/or 4 remake</strong>. Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village, and Requiem are already scheduled to hit the latest Nintendo console on February 27, 2026. Of course, this could also be standard phrasing that the publisher reuses for its showcase announcements without much consideration for whether the event will actually feature one or more games. </p>



<p>The 12-minute running time would definitely be pretty tight, with most of it undoubtedly reserved for Requiem. Even more unlikely is any announcement of the next rumored remakes, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-resident-evil-remakes-code-veronica-2027-zero-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Code: Veronica (2027) and Resident Evil Zero (2028)</a></strong>, which will have to wait until after the new entry has launched.</p>



<p>Anyway, the publisher invited fans to stick around on the Capcom USA Twitch channel after the end of the Resident Evil showcase for a discussion with guests Bawkbasoup and JenIsOnline, followed by a giveaway of a Resident Evil 4 Collector's Edition. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, publisher <strong>Nexon</strong> and developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong> announced that the third-person extraction shooter game <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> has now sold <strong>more than 12.4 million units</strong> to date since its launch on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>. The announcement confirms Alinea Analytics' latest estimates, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which had already indicated last week</a> that the game had surpassed 12 million copies. Moreover, the game registered around 960,000 concurrent players this month, not far from the impressive threshold of one million concurrent users (presumably across all platforms).</p>



<p>It is yet another confirmation, if needed, that ARC Raiders is incredibly good at maintaining its momentum so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>despite the AI voices controversy</strong></a>. Of course, the game's live service run has just started. Anyway, as a thank-you gesture for all the support, Embark is giving away a <strong>Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool</strong> to everyone who logged into the game at least once since launch till today at <strong>23:59 Central European Time</strong>.</p>



<p>The press release included the usual celebratory statements from Nexon and Embark. Junghun Lee, President and CEO of Nexon, stated:</p>



<p><em>We are incredibly pleased with the strong retention and enduring enthusiasm players in all major markets worldwide have shown for ARC Raiders. As pleased as we were with the October launch, reaching more than 12.4 million units and setting a record with 960,000 concurrent users in January demonstrates the potential for ARC Raiders to become another pillar in Nexon’s portfolio of blockbuster franchises. Embark Studios has delivered exactly what players worldwide have expected from the game, a fresh, highly differentiated experience in a massive global game genre. ARC Raiders’ success is a clear affirmation of Nexon Group’s goal of expanding our global footprint with horizontal growth from all-new games that capture and grow massive game communities in every major market and on multiple platforms.</em></p>



<p>Patrick Söderlund, Founder and CEO of Embark Studios, added:</p>



<p><em>Hitting 12.4 million units is a huge landmark—and it wouldn’t have happened without our players. The community of raiders has been part of this journey from the start, and their ideas and enthusiasm continue to guide where the game goes next.</em></p>



<p>ARC Raiders has earned the <strong>Best Multiplayer Game</strong> prize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at The Game Awards 2025</a> and the <strong>Most Innovative Gameplay</strong> prize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Steam Awards 2025</a>. It's also well-positioned to win <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2025-the-power-of-togetherness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's Best Multiplayer Game award from the community</a></strong>, although voting hasn't closed yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435450/Hardest/">Hardest</a></strong> is a free rock-paper-scissors game on Steam that was released in 2025 and made by indie developer <strong>Eero Laine</strong> under the studio name <strong>Rakuel</strong>. It's one of many games on Steam that includes a disclaimer towards the bottom of its page indicating it was made with generative AI tools, and on<strong> January 30, 2026</strong>, Laine plans to delete the game from Steam because his girlfriend of one month made him realize that "<em>AI is bad</em>," and now wants nothing to do with the game he made using <strong>GenAI</strong>.</p>



<p>Laine explains how he made the game through GenAI tools he had access to through university, and while the tools at first seemed 'free' for him to use without repercussions, he explains that he now understands more of the larger picture of what it means to use AI and GenAI tools from an economic and environmental standpoint.</p>



<p>"<em>This game will be deleted at 30.1</em>," Laine begins in a post on the game's Steam page. "<em>I made this game during the summer in [a] couple months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free and so.</em>" </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-Is-Bad.png"></a><figcaption><em>Eero Laine used this image as the heading for the post to announce the game's removal. Image credit: Eero Laine</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason to get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resrouces from the economy from hard working people.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I coded everything myself, so I can in the future make a new game with real assets if I feel like it, but the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players. Ethically only logical reason is to delete the game from Steam. The girl I've been dating for a month made me realize this. Thank you, Eero Laine</em>."</p>



<p>GenAI has been, and will continue to be, a controversial topic in video games. On one side, we have people like Eero Laine and indie publisher Hooded Horses, who are entirely against GenAI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/publisher-hooded-horse-added-no-fing-ai-assets-to-its-contracts-calls-genai-cancerous/">with the latter even adding a "<em>no f***ing AI assets" </em>clause to the contracts of games they decide to publish</a>. Starfinder: Afterlight developers Epictellers Entertainment told Wccftech, <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">"<em>there's no point in using AI for any creative endeavor</em>,"</a> and developers are even going out of their way to make it clear that they<a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/"> not only don't use GenAI tools, but have no intention of ever using GenAI tools</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there are companies like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studios</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">Larian Studios</a></strong> that have been more open about their GenAI use and support, and plenty of others who <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">believe that GenAI will become part of a game developer's toolset as much as anything else is</a>.</p>



<p>Whatever side of the aisle you sit on, it's clear that for Eero Laine, once his girlfriend pointed out some of the big negatives that go along with the current state of GenAI (<a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">not to mention what's happening with RAM prices</a>), they could no longer support the tech, no matter how small their support may have been. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘There Is an Underrepresented Majority That Wants Entertainment Without a Specific Agenda’, Says Ex Tripwire CEO]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/john-gibson-ex-tripwire-ceo-underrepresented-majority/</link>
            <guid>1403986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A little more than four years ago, <strong>John Gibson</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role as CEO and co-founder of <strong>Tripwire Interactive</strong></a> following a controversy sparked by his tweet supportive of the <strong>Texas Heartbeat Act</strong>, which banned abortions in the state after the detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity.</p>



<p>For a while, Gibson, who started as a programmer on the <strong>America's Army</strong> series (developed and published by the <strong>US Army</strong>) and then went on to co-found the studio known mainly for Red Orchestra and Killing Floor, remained out of the games industry. That changed around two years ago, when he started consulting for <strong>Bible X</strong>, the studio behind the Christian-based game project <strong>Gate Zero</strong>. Last month, Gibson, through his recently established publisher <strong>Templar Media</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the developer</a>.</p>



<p>I recently interviewed him to discuss the investment and the game itself, although we started with an explanation of Templar Media's slogan: <strong>"Entertainment First."</strong> Gibson wants to deliver games that focus on the fun factor rather than pushing a political agenda, as he said games (and other media) have been doing lately. </p>



<p><em>I was formerly the co-founder, co-owner, and CEO of Tripwire Interactive. Now, I am leading Templar Media. I founded Templar Media earlier this year.  After selling Tripwire, I took a break, but I realized I wanted to get back into games. <strong>I noticed that in a lot of media, the focus had shifted away from pleasing the player or the viewer. Instead, it was often about whatever commentary or message a developer or entertainer wanted to convey. This is where our slogan, "Entertainment First," originated.</strong> I wanted to establish a company focused on creating great content that people truly enjoy. While everyone aims to make something great, players can tell if your primary focus is not on building an entertaining and fun game. Our goal is to make great, entertaining content.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] <strong>We are catering to an underserved mainstream market. In America and somewhat in Europe, the people creating entertainment often represent a monolithic political block. However, consumers are not a monolithic block and do not necessarily share the same views as those making the entertainment. There is an underrepresented majority that wants entertainment without a specific agenda. </strong></em></p>



<p>Later, the former Tripwire executive referenced <strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong> specifically, where the <strong>Qu'nari</strong> companion <strong>Taash</strong> eventually transitions to non-binary and has a significant discussion with their mother, <strong>Shathann</strong> (an NPC), about it during a personal quest.</p>



<p><em>When I was growing up, movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones or games like Zelda and Metroid were about entertaining you, not an agenda. This has been lost in much of modern entertainment. <strong>For example, in the new Dragon Age game, there is a cutscene where the player is lectured about pronouns. We experience entertainment to forget about day-to-day politics and just have fun. Entertainment needs to go back to focusing on entertaining people.</strong> While our first game is faith-based, we are not afraid to tell those stories to an underserved market and to anyone who simply wants great content without modern agendas. As a company owner and designer, you must focus on what the customer will enjoy, not just your own preferences.</em></p>



<p>You can look forward to our full interview with John Gibson soon. Meanwhile, vote in the poll below and share your opinion in the comments.</p>
