			<p>Yesterday, ARC Raiders developer Embark Studios thanked the game's community for <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-continues-strong-launch-hits-700k-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching a new concurrent player peak on Steam of over 700K this past weekend</a>. This morning, publisher Nexon (also the parent company of Embark) announced in a press release that the PvPvE third-person extraction shooter game has sold more than four million units across all platforms to date, making it their most successful global launch ever.</p>



<p>Lee Jeong-hun, CEO of NEXON, stated:</p>



<p><em>We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Embark Studios for achieving the most successful global launch in Nexon's history. We are deeply impressed by the enthusiasm shown by our player community and look forward to building on that excitement with our content plans, including new maps, ARC vehicles, weapons, and quests, which will be available starting this month.</em></p>



<p>As recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as a few days ago</a>, estimates from Alinea Analytics indicated that game sales reached 2.5 million units in the first week. Clearly, the game has maintained its powerful momentum in the second week on the market.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is the second game released by Embark Studios, which was created by some former Battlefield developers who exited DICE. Their first release, The Finals, is a competitive team-based, free-to-play first-person shooter that focuses on arena matches. After a decent launch, many players didn't stick around, and for a while, the studio was uncertain about whether to continue supporting the game. Now, though, it appears to have recovered, and Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-ceo-battlefield-6-looks-really-good-the-finals-will-be-supported/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently said</a> the uplift ensures The Finals will be supported 'for years to come'.</p>



<p>Of course, with the level of success it's showing, there's no doubt ARC Raiders will be the studio's focus going forward. A few days ago, Embark introduced new map conditions, including an electromagnetic storm in Blue Gate, Spaceport, and Dam Battlegrounds, as well as a night raid in Blue Gate. The full public roadmap is available <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

			<p>Shortly after a new look at Yoshi and the reveal of Bowser Jr. in the film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">leaked by an image of a Pillsbury Cookie Dough box</a>, Nintendo announced that it will host a Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the Super Mario Galaxy Movie this coming Wednesday, November 12, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427">announced on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and in the Nintendo Today! app. The post on X (formerly Twitter) clarifies that there will be no video game-related news, so don't expect anything game-related. This Direct is specifically focused on the film, and that's it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Join us on Wednesday, Nov 12, at 6am PT for the Nintendo Direct featuring the world premiere of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie official trailer. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p><p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/KNSvfYk64l">https://t.co/KNSvfYk64l</a> <a href="https://t.co/PfTUJTyMQ3">pic.twitter.com/PfTUJTyMQ3</a></p></div>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The news of this Direct isn't exactly surprising, considering that just last week, a report (that we now know was at least partially correct) <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reportedly-appear-before-wicked-for-good/">claimed that the first proper trailer for the film would be shown online soon</a>, since it would also be shown at upcoming screenings of Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part-two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical.</p>



<p>We'll almost definitely see the first proper trailer for the film on Wednesday, and, if this Direct will be anything like the Direct event Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-movie-first-trailer-chris-pratt-voice/">did for the Super Mario Bros Movie</a>, we'll also likely find out the rest of the cast (save for those who are returning) and discover a little more about the film's plot.</p>



<p>The first Super Mario Bros. Movie was a massive hit at the box office, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/">making over $500 million in its first week</a>, and eventually eclipsing $1.3 billion globally. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">sequel was confirmed soon after</a>, which, if it keeps its current April 3, 2026 premiere date, will arrive almost three years to the date from when the first film premiered.</p>
