			<p>EA has just <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/news/pitch-notes-fc26-clubs-deep-dive">published a deep dive</a> into the changes it made in EA Sports FC 26 to Clubs, with revamps to archetypes and archetype progression, support for multiple clubs, dynamic Club Rush Live events, and more.</p>



<p>Regarding archetype progression, consumables are the new introduction to help players earn XP for their archetypes outside of playing matches or skill games, and to help players who didn't jump into FC 26 on day one and start building their clubs right away catch up to those who did. You'll unlock consumables through season pass and objective rewards, or through the Clubs Store. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And while there will be multiple kinds of consumables available, some of the ones EA is introducing are Archetype XP multipliers and Direct Apply AXP, both of which boost AXP either through match rewards or just a direct boost. Archetype unlocks are exactly what they sound like, letting you unlock any of the remaining 12 archetypes you didn't pick when you first jump into clubs, and the same goes with Archetype Resets, which let you reset your attribute points and redistribute them.</p>

<p>FC 26 also introduces signature perks, which, according to EA, "<em>encourage you to embody your chosen archetype or specialization whenever you step onto the pitch</em>." Every archetype comes with two perks that you unlock through archetype progression, and a third can be applied when you have a specialization active.</p>



<p>Some perks are action-focused, which means they're based around you performing specific actions on the pitch, while others are mechanic or team-based. Mechanic perks focus on improving elements of your game, like your passing, while team-based perks improve how your computer-controlled teammates receive passes and control the ball.</p>



<p>Live events coming to Clubs are one of the other major changes in FC 26, with new events coming to Clubs regularly through single-elimination knockout rush tournaments. That said, you do have multiple attempts to make it out of the first round if you lose a match when starting a rush tournament. You're truly eliminated when you lose each attempt.</p>

<p>Some of the rush tournaments will have house rules like Rugby Rush, which is basically a 'no fouls' mode, or a Designated Scorer mode, where goals only count if they come from a designated player.</p>



<p>Players can now also be a member of up to three clubs at a time, switching between them at will through the Clubs menu, but that doesn't mean you'll earn rewards for all three when playing a match for one of them. So make sure you have the right club selected if you're trying to earn rewards for a specific one.</p>



<p>The big promise with this year's entry into EA's long-running football series has been to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/"><em>make gameplay better</em>,</a>" and address the myriad of issues that players have had with the game for years. It's clear that EA is putting in some kind of effort from these deep dives and its marketing, but whether it's all sizzle and no steak is something we won't know until FC 26 launches on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on September 26, 2025.</p>
