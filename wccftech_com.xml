<p>During the showcase, Game Director Jasmin Roy discussed some of South of Midnight's key spells:</p>
<p><em>Push, Pull, and Weave are some of the spells at your disposal that give you a tactical advantage during a fight. Timing is everything. Pull distant enemies close to start melee combos, push them back to interrupt and stun their attack, then press the advantage with follow-up strikes.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The game is expected to take between ten to twelve hours to complete.</p>

			<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, the first new main entry in the series developed by Team NINJA in years, has been announced today for PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The fourth main entry in the series, which is being developed in collaboration with PlatinumGames, was revealed during today's Xbox Developer Direct with an action-packed trailer that highlighted how the new game will masterfully combine the challenging gameplay the series is known for with PlatinumGames fast-paced gameplay. Playable characters Yakumo and series' protagonist Ryu Hayabusa will be able to take on a variety of powerful enemies using different fighting styles as well as some of the series' iconic special techniques, such as the Izuna Drop. With a level design featuring enhanced verticality and dynamism and a lot of challenges and secrets hidden inside this chaotic and dark recreation of Tokyo, Ninja Gaiden 4 is looking to be a more than worthy new entry in the series.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft has just opened the pre-orders for Assassin's Creed Shadows, and in doing so, they also revealed the official PC system requirements. We already knew the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be rather heavy</a>, which the specs below have certainly confirmed.&nbsp;All of them require 16GB RAM, Windows 10/11 with DirectX 12, and an SSD.</p>
