			<p>EA has confirmed that it will fully reveal EA Sports FC 26, the next entry in its annual football simulation series, later this week, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. It has also revealed one of the cover athletes for this year to be iconic Swedish player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who will appear on the cover of the Ultimate Edition of the game. </p>

<p>Zlatan is being added as an icon item in the game, adding him to the roster of legendary footballers to have their careers celebrated in EA Sports FC. Though there's no official release date yet for EA Sports FC 26, veteran players of the series should expect it to fall where it usually does in the year, which is sometime in the early fall, more specifically in September. </p>

<p>If you want to catch up on the state of the EA Sports FC series, you can try out last year's entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-the-alters-ea-sports-fc-25-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-june/">EA Sports FC 25 on Xbox Game Pass</a>, since it joined the service just last month. Not that EA particularly wants players, or anyone, really, to look back on last year's entry. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ea-ceo-explains-why-fc-25-failed-to-meet-financial-expectations/">EA Sports FC 25 missed its financial targets</a>, a huge blow to the company that relies on its annual sports games to make up the bulk of its revenue. While it saw huge success with the return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football</a>, the main breadwinner for EA has always been its football series and the live service side of it, Football Ultimate Team (FUT).</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA shut down projects and laid off developers at Respawn</a>, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">shut down the studio it built to make a new Black Panther game</a>, cancelling the game. It's difficult to imagine that EA wouldn't make more cuts if it goes through another year of its flagship sports game missing its targets.</p>
