			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/">Gran Turismo 7</a> implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler is among the best we have seen to date, despite some issues, a new analysis revealed.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> shared their analysis of the PlayStation 5 Pro patch of the latest entry in the series by Polyphony Digital, going over all the enhancements, which include full ray tracing support for both races and replays, PSSR implementation, an 8K mode and a slew of PS VR 2 improvements. Interestingly enough, users are limited to using the PSSR upscaler only if they want to experience ray tracing in cockpit view, most likely due to how demanding it is. In every other scenario, users can either use PSSR or the original TAA option with or without ray tracing.</p>
<p>With the PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive upscaler, the image is reconstructed to 4K resolution from resolutions that can go as low as 1080p, producing a good result but not the best possible one, as, for example, thin objects show additional shimmering and noise, which can be distracting. In some scenarios, image quality takes a big hit due to visual artifacts, such as tail lights with ray tracing enabled getting rendered in a noisy mess. TAA shows none of these issues, delivering a slightly better image quality overall.</p>
<p>Where the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler seems to deliver in Gran Turismo 7 is in the 8K mode. In this mode, the image is reconstructed from a 4K resolution to an 8K resolution, delivering very solid results that further highlight how the higher the base resolution is, the better the upscaler works. Given how an 8K screen is required for this mode, not many users, however, will be able to experience this mode.</p>
<p>The Gran Turismo 7 PlayStation 5 Pro patch analysis by Digital Foundry also covers the aforementioned new ray tracing features, which greatly elevate the visual experience, and the PS VR 2 enhancements, which further improve what is still the killer app for the headset. You can watch the analysis in full below.</p>

<p>Gran Turismo 7 is only one of the games that benefits from the PlayStation 5 Pro's increased power over the base model and its exclusive features.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-has-found-new-targets-in-its-war-against-piracy-including-members-of-a-certain-subreddit.1047330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-piracy-members-subreddit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is about to pursue some new targets in its fight against piracy, and according to a new report, not even members of select subreddits are safe from the Japanese company.</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic">Game File,</a> in a recent filing in federal court, the Japanese company revealed that its investigation against Switch modder James Williams, also known as Archbox, has given it some new targets. During the investigation, Nintendo became aware of multiple other online actors who appeared to have a role in the Pirate Shops operation conducted by Archbox, and as such, is now seeking the go-ahead from the court to subpoena business records from internet domain companies Name Cheap, Go Daddy and Tucows, Cloudflare, GitHub, Discord, Google and Reddit to identify anyone who helped the modder with their illicit activities.</p>
<p>In Reddit's case, Nintendo outright mentions a specific subreddit called SwitchPirates, which was moderated by Archbox and currently has over 200,000 members. The Japanese company also has reason to believe that the modder had multiple accounts involved with the subreddit and that other prominent members played a role in the modder's activities. Once these people have been identified, Nintendo will use the obtained information to pursue infringement claims.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been waging its war against piracy for a very long time, but its activities in this regard have been ramped up recently. This year, the Japanese company shut down the most popular Nintendo Switch emulators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a>, possibly to prevent the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rom-emulate/">Nintendo Switch 2 from being emulated soon after its release.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it.1047327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We started <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-reportedly-still-due-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> over a year ago that Microsoft would build an Xbox mobile store to launch this year, following rumors from The Verge's Tom Warren. Shortly after, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-looking-to-build-xbox-mobile-store-with-the-help-of-some-partners-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the plan was real.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced Xbox mobile game sales via Web in July, but the real plan was to sell games directly through their Android app. Xbox president Sarah Bond previously said the goal was to start in November, but that did not happen, and the executive has now revealed why in a series of messages <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bondsarahbond.bsky.social/post/3lbxhvggn7d2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent on Blue Sky</a>.</p>
<p><em>At Xbox, we want to offer players more choice on how and where they play, including being able to play and buy games directly from the Xbox app. I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the U.S. while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand. Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned. Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision. We are eager to launch and give more choice and flexibility to players.</em></p>
<p>Essentially, Google is trying to block the launch (following Judge James Donato's ruling that Android is an illegal monopoly) of this feature on the Xbox app with a temporary administrative stay ahead of their appeal. However, the Android company has shared a statement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with The Verge</a> to illustrate its own perspective:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft has always been able to offer their Android users the ability to play and purchase Xbox games directly from their app – they’ve simply chosen not to. The Court’s order, and rush to force its implementation, threaten Google Play’s ability to provide a safe and secure experience. Microsoft, like Epic, are ignoring these very real security concerns. We remain focused on supporting an ecosystem that works for everyone, not just two of the largest game companies.</em></p>
<p>Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1861995680752918586?t=ImJiuaUBU2BX0SLRle_Ezg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was quick to jump on this response</a>, attacking Google in the process:</p>
<p><em>Google’s statement is deceitful. Shame on them. They well know that the 30% cut they demand is far more than all of the profit from game streaming. They know this because they blew hundreds of millions of dollars building the failed Stadia game business themselves.</em></p>
<p>Sweeney was, of course, leading the charge against both Google and Apple in an effort to open up their respective app stores for everyone. The Epic Games Store <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile in August, bringing back Fortnite to iOS (only in Europe for now) after a lengthy and costly legal fight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 to Be Revealed in January for a March 2025 Release – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-to-be-revealed-in-january-for-a-march-2025-release-%E2%80%93-rumor.1047306/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console will be unveiled sometime in January and will be released only two months after its reveal, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime">Nintendo Prime</a>, a rumor discovered on Weibo suggests the new Nintendo console will be finally revealed in January for a March 2025 release, possibly towards the end of the month. As for production and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/">shipment of units</a>, over 650,000 units have already been shipped in various regions, and a huge quantity of components has been produced since September.</p>
<p><iframe title="RUMOR: Nintendo Switch 2 is Releasing in March 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tItqYDzDoIE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a random post on a Chinese forum is generally not a very reliable source, things are different in this particular case. As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1bmwo/update_on_the_rumor_switch_2_will_be_revealed_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, this user got a lot of Nintendo announcements right before they were made in the past and has since deleted all of their posts. Some of the announcements that were gotten right were pretty difficult to guess, such as The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky The First remake announcement, so it definitely looks like this user has access to insider information in some way.</p>
<p>Despite the source of the rumor looking reliable, we have to take what they have revealed about the Nintendo Switch 2 with a grain of salt until the system is finally revealed and dated, which shouldn't take too long if these rumors are correct. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned.</p>
