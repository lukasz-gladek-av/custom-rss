			<p><strong>Hooded Horse</strong>, a publisher that made a name for itself when it picked up <a href="https://wccftech.com/manor-lords-indie-hit-160k-concurrent-steam/">Manor Lords</a> and has since been known to have a keen eye for strategy and city-building games, has drawn its line in the sand on GenAI tech. In an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku,</a> Hooded Horse's chief executive officer, <strong>Tim Bender</strong>, made it clear that the publisher will not sign studios that use GenAI.</p>



<p>The studio has even gone so far as to add a <strong>"<em>no f***ing AI assets"</em></strong> line into its contracts, banning any studios that work with it from using generative AI technology in the process of developing their game. "<em>If I sound frustrated, it's because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult</em>," said Bender.</p>



<p>"<em>I f***ing hate GenAI art, and it has made my life more difficult in many ways,</em>" Bender continued. "<em>Suddenly it infests s**t in a way it shouldn't. It is not written into our contracts if we're publishing the game, 'no f***ing AI assets.'"</em></p>



<p>It's a strong stance for the publisher to take, though not a surprising one when you consider the amount of <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">backlash studios like Larian</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studios</a> have received with their admittance of using GenAI tech, and even non-gaming companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/dell-pulls-back-ai-first-push-after-admitting-customers-arent-interested/">Dell admitting that consumers are "<em>not buying based on AI</em>,"</a> signifying that people do not want to hear that AI and GenAI is at the forefront of new products.</p>



<p>That said, Bender goes on to say that simply including the ban on GenAI in the contract and drawing its line in the sand is what's easy. Actually ensuring that developers follow through with the ban is a different story. </p>



<p>"<em>We've gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don't use any GenAI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, 'Okay, well, maybe what I'll do is for this place, I'll put it as a placeholder,' right? Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they'll think, 'It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.' But if that gets done, of course, there's a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something</em>. <em>Because of that, we're constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it's cancerous</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>It's clear that GenAI is going to continue to be a controversial topic in the video game industry when it comes to its use in game development. Some studios, like the aforementioned Embark, will continue to use it without shame or fear, especially when you consider that Embark's latest release,<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/"> ARC Raiders</a></strong>, is arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">one of the biggest recent commercial successes in games</a>.</p>



<p>But for Hooded Horse, it's not so much a question of using GenAI being bad PR; it's that the team firmly does not believe in the technology and takes an ethical stance against it. "<em>When it comes to GenAI, it's not a PR issue, it's an ethics issue,</em>" Bender added. "<em>The reality is, there's so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won't allow it in the game, and if it's ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out, and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It's a shame that it's even necessary, and it's a very frustrating thing to have to worry about</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Hooded Horse is just one indie publisher in a sea of publishers. We can't say if another company will take the same approach, but as conversation and controversy around GenAI continue to rise, it wouldn't be a surprise if we start seeing more companies draw their own line in the sand on GenAI.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 09/01/2026: </strong>In response to the publication of this article, a separate user on <a href="https://x.com/hajedan/status/2009669186285646307?s=46">X (formerly Twitter)</a> dug into the Smarty.cz source code to verify the Steam Machine pricing estimates for themselves, and went a step further to look into <strong>Alza</strong>, another Czech retailer and one of the country's largest.</p>



<p>On Alza's listing for the Steam Machine, user Hajedan also found that it had a similar pricing structure for the Steam Machine, though added that the original post's indication that the actual price will be lower than the conversion estimates is almost definitely correct due to Alza and Smarty.cz including their own markups.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, these prices are just estimates, and we won't know anything for sure until Valve announces official prices, and you should take them with the appropriate grain of salt. That said, these initial leaks can at least prepare you for what you can expect to pay if you want to add a GabeCube to your collection.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Valve's reveal of its Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">was one of 2025's biggest announcements</a>, and while players are excited about the potential of the new GabeCube, one question has hovered above the new hardware like a dark cloud (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">that grows even darker with memory shortage complications</a>): <strong>how much will the Steam Machine cost?</strong></p>



<p>Well, we don't yet have official pricing, but a leak from a Czech retailer may have just provided our first indication as to what the latest gaming box will cost. Shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingnewsandleaks/comments/1q88b1u/grain_of_salt_steam_machine_price_leaked_1000_for/">Reddit's GamingLeaksandRumors page by user chusskaptaan</a>, a third-party Czech retailer known as <a href="https://www.smarty.cz/Valve-Steam-Machine-512GB-4p249960">Smarty.cz has a live listing for the Steam Machine</a>, featuring two different models.</p>



<p>The first is a <strong>512GB</strong> model, which, according to the website's source code, seems to cost <strong>19,826 CZK</strong>, or approximately <strong>$950 USD</strong>. The other model is a <strong>2TB</strong> version, and it seems to be listed at <strong></strong><strong>22,305 CZK</strong>, or <strong>$1,070 USD.</strong></p>



<p>It should be noted that these prices are estimates based on a conversion from Czech Koruna, and as the post itself notes, third-party retailers could have their own markups, which means the actual retail price of the machine from Valve could very well be lower.</p>



<p>That said, while Valve hasn't made any official announcements about the price, it's been made <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">clear from multiple sides of the tech industry that prices on hardware will increase</a> due to the current memory crisis, and when Valve was asked <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">if the company would be subsidizing the price of its new box</a>, the answer was a flat no.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>No, it's more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market</em>," began software engineer at Valve, Pierre-Loup Griffais. "<em></em><em>Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is."</em></p>



<p>So while we've seen pricing estimates from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">creators like LinusTechTips who've tried to guess at what the cost of the new box would be</a> and found that it might not be too expensive, the reality might not be as kind. Still, for what the Steam Machine could be capable of, paying a little more than $1k for it is arguably still a good deal, when you consider the freedom of choice you get with a Steam Machine versus a traditional console or the cost of building your own PC.</p>



<p>As for when we could hear official words from Valve on the price, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/"> latest reports point to a <strong>Spring 2026</strong> release</a>, and if that's true, then we'll know sooner than later what the actual price will be. </p>
