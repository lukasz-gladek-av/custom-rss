			<p>American indie developer and publisher ProbablyMonsters released their first game, Storm Lancers, on Nintendo Switch 2 (and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store) last month after an earlier debut on Nintendo Switch in September 2025. The game is priced at $19.99, and existing Nintendo Switch users can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for free.</p>



<p>We've sent a list of questions to the team focused on the recent launch and the studio as a whole. In their answers, they described Nintendo's new platform as <strong>the perfect home for their Storm Lancers game</strong>, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-update-20-0-0-adds-virtual-game-cards-gameshare-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GameShare</strong> feature</a>. The team also revealed that while they are open to using AI tools for 'assisting with administrative work' and 'automating repetitive technical tasks', their games are made 'by people, for people' and <strong>do not use AI for asset creation or creative decisions</strong>. Scroll down to read their replies in full.</p>

<p><strong>What can you tell us about ProbablyMonsters?</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>ProbablyMonsters is an independent game publisher and developer focused on building a better way to make games and build careers in games. With offices in Fort Worth, TX and Bellevue, WA, <strong>our team of AAA industry veterans is built with a unique structure that allows us to develop multiple games of different scales at the same time.</strong> We are committed to developing and releasing multiple high-quality PC and console titles each year, which we started last year with our debut titles Storm Lancers and Ire: A Prologue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Can you introduce us to your recently released game, Storm Lancers?</strong></p>



<p>Storm Lancers is an <strong>action rogue-like</strong> that combines <strong>retro 80’s aesthetics</strong> with intense combat, while introducing a new twist to the fan-favorite rogue-like genre: <strong>couch co-op</strong>. After you and a friend crash-land on a dying alien world with unstable magic, you work together to unleash new powers, carve through evolving hordes, and grow even stronger. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While it can be played solo, Storm Lancers was designed with two player co-op in mind and <strong>utilizes GameShare on Nintendo Switch 2 and Remote Play Together on Steam</strong> to allow players to partner up even if only one of them owns a copy of the game. Adding co-op into a rogue-like was a fun and exciting challenge for our development team, and we hope players have enjoyed becoming true legends of Cryptica together.</p>



<p><strong>What was the reaction so far? Is there any early feedback from the community that you can address here already? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The reaction to Storm Lancers has been positive overall, and players are fans of our two-player co-op feature, the game’s vibrant art style, and its responsive controls. As Storm Lancers is our first title, we built it at a more limited size and scope to help us get our feet wet, and we’ve received some feedback that people wish there was more of the game to play. In our minds, this is great feedback because it signals that players resonate with the experience we’ve created and are really having fun, which was our primary goal with Storm Lancers.</p>



<p>We have also heard that some players are experiencing performance issues in the recently released Steam version of the game, and we are hard at work on a patch to address these. This will be released in the next few weeks so keep an eye on Discord and X for the patch announcement.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you choose Nintendo's platforms as the first consoles to get Storm Lancers? Do you plan to launch it on PlayStation and/or Xbox later?</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo has been a great partner for us, and <strong>Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 are the perfect home for a co-op title that players can enjoy at home or on the go.</strong> We made a conscious decision early on to build Storm Lancers so that it could be played with a single Joy-Con controller, which makes it as easy as possible for players to bring a friend along for the adventure. Nintendo offered us an opportunity to be featured back in their Nintendo Direct presentation last September, which was the perfect place to stealth-launch the title.</p>



<p><strong>We do not currently have plans to launch Storm Lancers on PlayStation or Xbox consoles</strong> and will let our fans know if this changes. Our primary focus is growing our audience on Steam and supporting the Nintendo of Europe release of the Switch 2 version on January 22nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I understand Storm Lancers supports the GameShare feature. What do you think of it, and why is it so important for your game? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We built Storm Lancers to truly shine in co-op, and <strong>GameShare gives us a unique path to building a couch co-op like experience for players who live apart</strong>. Being able to see the same screen and play on the same copy of the game creates a truly seamless experience, and so we were excited when we first saw Nintendo’s announcement of the new feature. As players, <strong>we think it offers massive value for households and friends who want to play together</strong>, and as a self-publisher, we see GameShare as a great tool for helping us promote Storm Lancers organically.</p>



<p><strong>Was it hard to implement GameShare? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Implementing GameShare into Storm Lancers was very easy, and our small but mighty engineering team was able to get it fully implemented and released in just over a month. The tech is incredible, and it is a great, quick solution to building online multiplayer capabilities without developing new features from the ground up.</p>



<p><strong>Beyond GameShare, what do you think of the Switch 2 as a whole? Does this version offer any noticeable improvements over the Switch 1?</strong></p>



<p>We at ProbablyMonsters are big fans of Nintendo Switch 2 and are excited that the more powerful hardware will allow us to be more ambitious with the art pipelines, performance, and fidelity of our games. Seeing Storm Lancers in 4K resolution with 60FPS performance was truly something special, and we’re happy that Nintendo Switch 2 lets us experience that.</p>



<p><strong>The Switch 2's HDR feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has often been criticized</a>. Do you think that's fair?</strong></p>



<p>We have seen criticisms of HDR on Nintendo Switch 2, but from a development perspective, we never encountered any issues working with it and think Storm Lancers looks awesome with the expanded range of colors. Consumers always have a right to criticize the technology they purchase when it does not work as intended or live up to their expectations, but that feedback is for them to provide. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You also launched another game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547420/Ire_A_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ire: A Prologue</a> in October. That's a very different, horror-inspired experience. Are you going to build upon it to deliver a full-fledged horror game? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We have <strong>several titles in development for release over the next couple of years and are building games in a broad range of genres that will help us reach every type of player.</strong> We will have more to say about some of them in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong>As a small developer, what is your policy on AI usage in game development? Do you believe we're going toward a future where it is inevitable?</strong></p>



<p>We have <strong>several titles in development for release over the next couple of years and are building games in a broad range of genres that will help us reach every type of player.</strong> We will have more to say about some of them in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p>Ori series developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/">Moon Studios</a></strong> has just released a new gameplay trailer for its action RPG currently in early access, <strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong>. The title is due to receive a major update a little more than a week from the time of this writing with its <strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong> update, officially adding <strong>co-op</strong> to the game.</p>



<p>Players could have already tried the update while it was in <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-updates-launches-january-22-2026/">beta for a weekend at the end of 2025</a>, but starting next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> it'll be live for all players. This new update"<em>reimagines traditional co-op multiplayer play of current ARPGs and MMORPGS," </em>writes Moon Studios in a press release<em>, "allowing up to <strong>four players </strong>to share a free, persistent Realm without the need for a host to be online.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked Together | Co-op | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RmTU-DbFOd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>All four players get to share the rewards they earn from combat, while enemies will react differently when you have three friends on your side, all trying to corner them. You'll also be able to work with your friends outside of combat as well, as you can share and build housing, fish, and seemingly experience the whole game with three of your friends by your side.</p>



<p>The 'Together' update is the first major update of 2026 for No Rest for the Wicked, which launched in early access nearly two years ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/">April 18, 2024</a>.</strong> There's currently no exact timeline for when the game will hit its <strong>1.0 launch</strong>, but speculation from players does point to it potentially arriving sometime in 2026. We'll see how the year goes for Moon Studios, though, with co-op due to arrive in the game soon, it does seem like the community could be right with its 2026 guess.</p>

			<p>After several of the titles joining the <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong> and <strong>Premium</strong> game catalogues <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850">leaked yesterday evening</a>, <strong>PlayStation</strong> has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-january-resident-evil-village-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-and-more/">officially confirmed</a> all of the games that PS Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers will be getting access to for January 2026, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, </strong>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/darkest-dungeon-ii-full-release-owners-of-original-discount/"><strong>Darkest Dungeon</strong> <strong>II</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Once again, players paying top-dollar for the Premium subscription only get one game added to the Classics Catalog, which seems to continue a trend of Premium subscribers seemingly getting the short end of the stick. </p>



<p>That's not to say anything against Ridge Racer, more to say that while yes, Premium subscribers are also paying for the other games joining the Extra and Essential tiers each month, the Classics Catalog is one of the only key differences between Premium and the other tiers. Some months, no games enter the Classics Catalog. It simply has to leave those players wondering what they're paying for, if they can't expect the library of Classic games to actually grow at a reasonable rate.</p>



<p>Regardless, here is the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for January 2026, all of which will be available starting <strong>January 20, 2026</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Resident Evil Village (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)</li>



<li>Darkest Dungeon II (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>The Exit 8 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Art of Rally (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Little to the Left (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Ridge Racer (PS5, PS4) - <strong>Premium-tier subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, PS Plus Essential subscribers (and every other tier of PS Plus subscribers) got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/">add <strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong> to their lineup</a>.</p>
