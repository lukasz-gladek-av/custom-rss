			<p>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-series-creator-reportedly-going-to-netease-while-tencent-is-rumored-to-be-acquiring-a-japanese-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> SEGA three years ago to join NetEase, where he <a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> his own Tokyo-based studio to make global console games.</p>
<p>The game designer was featured in a lengthy interview with Japanese magazine Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> yesterday. Nagoshi talked about various topics, but the most interesting tidbit is arguably that he believes the era where game size is the selling point will soon pass.</p>
<p><em>What I'm making now is an action adventure. After the experimental phase and the phase where the experiments are exhausted, we will move on to the phase of mass-producing assets, but I think it would be good if you thought of it as being on the eve of the mass-production phase. In that sense, it's going well, but in many ways, it's a bit large in scale. In addition, at first glance, the game system is complicated. But I don't want to make it a troublesome game... Well, it's difficult to talk about what I can't say at this point.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I want to make it a game that is satisfying to play, but I don't want it to be a hassle. Even though there aren't many completely new games out there, there are so many titles out there that you can't play them all, including overseas. Looking at the situation, I think the volume of console games in the lives of average game fans may be a bit excessive. There are still many titles out there, but I feel that the era of games where volume is the selling point is about to pass.</em></p>
<p>The interesting thing is that he admits his next game is also going to be large in scale, which isn't surprising given that his last game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, required 45.5 hours just for the main quest, while a completionist playthrough can take an average of 103 hours, according to How Long To Beat.</p>
<p>Anyway, Nagoshi said his team is currently assessing the proper size for this game, though the map they've created is already large - maybe too much.</p>
<p><em>One characteristic that is particularly relevant in overseas markets is that a certain amount of volume is necessary, and although there is a sense that "it has to be at least this much," I think that this is also a kind of fixed idea. So we continue to discuss, "What is the appropriate volume at the time of releasing the game?" I'm currently thinking hard about how to predict or measure that volume and how to arrange the game's density to suit the appropriate volume and size.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We will soon have to enter the mass production phase of assets, so it will soon be time to decide on the final volume estimate, but we are currently thinking about whether this is really good enough. Of course, we have a map, but the one at the current stage is too large. I started by studying existing games and creating a fairly large map. I had already created roads and highways. Now, I'm shrinking it little by little and looking for a good balance for the game.</em></p>
<p>The Yakuza creator also revealed that the team size is around 80. He'd like to share more about the project in the near future, too. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch is among the best ones to date, introducing new options that provide a deeper insight into the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler alongside great visual and performance improvements.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry analyzed the game's PS5 Pro patch, highlighting the new features that it introduces and how it takes advantage of the console's power and features. The patch replaces the standard Performance Mode with a PS5 Pro Enhanced mode that uncaps the framerate so that those with a 120Hz screen with VRR can enjoy a high framerate experience that consistently runs at above 60 FPS, hitting the 100 FPS range rather often.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch, however, is the new Scaling options, which include PSSR anti-aliasing and the TAA option the game has featured since launch. These options, which can be switched on the fly, provide a great insight into the performance cost of the PSSR upscaler, which does a great job enhancing the image quality and the perception of distant detail using the same 1440p base resolution as TAA but does impact performance. In one of the game's most CPU-intensive scenarios, using PSSR over TAA made the game run at 10 frames per second less or more. As such, this essentially confirms the PSSR cost on performance of 2ms every frame that was revealed in the internal documents leaked a few months ago.</p>
<p>Rounding out the improvements the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch brings in its new enhanced mode is the presence of all the image quality features seen in the base game's Quality Mode, including the light ray tracing for the scene-aligned cube maps, which is still not available in the PC version of the game. All of these features make the patch one of the best released to date, enhancing the experience considerably in both image quality and performance over the base model.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-rtx-4080/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unreal-engine-5-4-continues-to-challenge-high-end-gpus-as-undemanding-game-struggles-to-run-at-4k-60-on-an-rtx-4080.1033365/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-rtx-4080/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Running games powered by the Unreal Engine 5.4 smoothly continues to be a challenge even for current high-end GPUs, as an RTX 4080 GPU has trouble running an undemanding fan-made game powered by the engine at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, <a href="https://projectborealis.com/prologue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3</a>, a fan-made project powered by the latest public version of the engine, cannot run at a steady 60 frames per second at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS Ultra Quality preset even in scenarios where there isn't a lot happening on screen. With other DLSS settings and Frame Generation, performance is considerably better, but this is only making it more clear that a native 4K, 60 FPS experience is not possible on the vast majority of current gaming hardware, although better optimization, which shouldn't be expected for what is essentially a demo of a fan-made project like this, could have improved the situation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Borealis - A Prologue to Half-Life 3 on Unreal Engine 5.4 | RTX 4080 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 FG" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bs2XrBrpbBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One more thing the video above makes abundantly clear regarding Unreal Engine 5.4 is that, despite performance improvements over past versions, the engine still leaves plenty to be desired in regard to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-performance-improvement-frame-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame time stability</a>, as the stutters are pretty evident at all resolutions. This has been a persistent issue in games powered by Epic's engine for a long while, and there still doesn't seem to be a solution to the problem in sight, although things may improve in the future thanks to the effort of developers well-known for their technical expertise, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-issues-improvements/">CD Projekt Red.</a></p>
<p>More information on Unreal Engine 5.4 can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/review/aukey-magfusion-gamefrost-wireless-charger-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aukey-magfusion-gamefrost-wireless-charger-review-%E2%80%93-fast-cool-and-built-for-gamers.1033281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/aukey-magfusion-gamefrost-wireless-charger-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<main>

					

					<!--<div class="ads-container banner-ad floated p-0">
						<div data-pg-ad-spot='div-gpt-ad-wccftechcom38564' style="min-height: 280px;"></div>
					</div>-->
					
										
					<p>AUKEY has just introduced its new MagFusion GameFrost wireless charger as part of its Omnia-Frez series, bringing some serious heat (rather, the opposite) to the wireless charging category. The company's Omnia-Frez lineup includes three products, but the one we will focus on is the most crucial one, especially for mobile gamers. The <a href="http://cutt.ly/8eHX6nwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUKEY MagFusion GameFrost wireless charger</a> is designed to offer advanced cooling features with MagSafe compatibility and seamless Qi2 support for a wide range of devices. With a price tag of $42.99, the wireless charger delivers excellent value to a specific niche. The company is also offering a 10% launch discount with code <strong>GAMEFROST10</strong>.</p>
<h4>Design: Tough with thoughtful details</h4>
<p>The AUKEY MagFusion GameFrost comes in a minimal package that includes the essentials: the wireless charger itself, a sturdy USB-C to USB-C braided cable in black, and a user manual. The inclusion of the high-quality braided cable is definitely a plus for the accessory, as it will restrict the wires from remaining untangled.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Visually, the MagFusion GameFrost wireless charger from AUKEY features a sleek, circular design with a sturdy aluminum build that gives it a premium feel. We have seen wireless chargers in the past that scream plastic, and considering what you are paying for the charger, it is indeed worth it. The aluminum build also contributes to better build quality and durability that protects the cooling components on the inside. Thanks to the build, it is a bit on the heavier end and if you are pairing it with a 'Pro Max' version of the iPhone, you will feel a massive difference.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The MagFusion GameFrost features a soft-touch finish that protects the device from scratches, and the rubberized edges also keep it secure in place during charging. On the front, you will get three buttons and an LED indicator for temperature monitoring. The design includes a power button that turns wireless charging on or off, a button to adjust the LED light models, and a button that controls the fan's speed so you can choose the settings that best fit your preferences.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h4>Performance: Fast charging with impressive cooling power</h4>
<p>The AUKEY MagFusion GameFrost delivers 15W of fast wireless charging, making it one of the best options for iPhone or Android devices that supports the new Qi2 standard. The versatility of the accessory is quite, as it can accommodate a wide range of devices, making it an ideal choice for households with mixed phone brands.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The MagSafe magnets at the back are quite strong, and you really have to apply some force to get it off, which is a good thing considering it is designed for gamers and their need to keep the phone in their hand while charging. You can most certainly forget that the MagFusion GameFrost will drop on its own. I used the wireless charger over my MagSafe leather case from Otterbox, and it worked flawlessly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Getting to the main selling point of the AUKEY MagFusion GameFrost, the powerful active cooling system will keep your phone's temperature way below room temperature. This means that users who game for long sessions will be glad to know that their devices will be cold to the touch. Based on the LED indicator on the <a href="https://www.aukey.com/discount/GAMEFROST10?redirect=%2Fproducts%2Flc-g10-magfusion-gamefrost-magnetic-wireless-charger-with-active-cooling-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MagFusion GameFrost wireless charger</a>, I was able to go as low as 12 degrees Celsius with the fan speed set on high.</p>
<p>The active cooling system includes three fan modes: slow, medium, and fast, which you can set based on what you are doing on your device. For standard usage, we would recommend slow or medium, but if you are editing a short video or gaming, the fan's fast speed will definitely keep the temperatures stable for extended use.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While the MagFusion GameFrost is good at what it does, the fan is a bit loud, especially when it is set to fast mode, so you will be able to hear the blades running in your sessions. The low and medium settings of the fan are bearable so you would not be too distracted while you game or work.</p>
<h4>Cold to the touch: Reducing temperatures by up to 20 degrees</h4>
<p>AUKEY claims that the MagFusion GameFrost can reduce device temperatures by up to 20 degrees Celsius, which is a game-changer for users who push their phones to the limit. In my experience, the charger effectively dropped my deviceâs temperature from the high double digits to a comfortable single-digit range. This specific aspect is particularly important for gamers who need their phones to stay cool to avoid thermal throttling, which reduces the device's performance. Furthermore, lower temperatures also contribute to better battery health and slow down the degradation process.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://cutt.ly/8eHX6nwg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUKEY MagSafe Fusion GameFrost wireless charger</a> is a great choice for anyone looking to upgrade their charging setup. It is a combination of fast 15W charging, efficient cooling system, and MagSafe compatibility for a wide range of phones. The light modes are for aesthetics, and the three fan settings give users more control over the hardware and its performance.</p>
