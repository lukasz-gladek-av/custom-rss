			<p>The first PlayStation 5 Pro teardown video was shared online today, providing a better look at the new console launching in a few days worldwide.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by Brazilian channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TAG22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TAG</a>, provides a good look at the console's internal components, cooling solution and more, and it is a very interesting watch even for those who don't speak Portuguese and want to see how much the console differs from the base model.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 PRO POR DENTRO ðŸ‘ŠðŸ˜ƒ | PS5 PRO teardown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1VSPgqY7Yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As confirmed in the teardown video above, the PlayStation 5 Pro features a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-improvement-repairability/">major repairability improvement</a> that grants easy access to the system's CMOS battery, allowing users to easily swap it out and ensure the console will continue to function normally in case the original battery runs out or becomes defective over time.</p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro specs were widely known already thanks to the many rumors that circulated online in the past few months, we have learned today that the system features an additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-specs-leak-unveils-2-extra-gb-of-ddr5-ram/">2 GB of DDR 5 RAM</a>, which is likely reserved for the OS. As such, developers should be able to utilize 16 GB for games, something that is not possible on the base model because some RAM has to be reserved for the OS.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

			<p>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro</a> isn't officially out until November 7, some people have started getting their hands on Sony's revised PlayStation 5 console. An unboxing video was posted a couple of days ago and quickly taken down; now, Brazilian content creator Brunno Fast has also managed to secure a console and subsequently <a href="https://x.com/brunno_fast/status/1852829727234379871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full spec sheet document included in the box.</p>
<p>By far the biggest surprise is that Sony added 2GB of DDR 5 RAM. These are likely to be reserved for the OS so that game developers can fully utilize the 16 GB of GDDR6 for the actual games. Beyond that, it's largely what we already knew.</p>

<p><em>* The capacity of the SSD has been calculated using base 10 maths (1 GB .1,000,000,000 bytes). ** Part of the SSD's capacity is reserved for use in connection with console administration and maintenance, as well as additional options. This can happen during the installation of system software or other software.

<p>To recap, the PS5 Pro offers 67% greater computing power than the base PS5 in terms of raw TFLOPS. According to Sony, this translates into around 45% faster rendering on average. However, as several developers recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a>, the console's true ace in the hole is probably PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the customized AI-powered upscaling developed by Sony. According to the developers of The First Descendant, it can stand up to the quality of any upscalers, even NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the PS5 Pro officially launches next Thursday in stores globally. It will be priced at $699/Â£699/â‚¬799.</p>
