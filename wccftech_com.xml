			<p>Marvel Rivals is currently only available on the current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, but as of next week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-marvel-go-ahead-to-make-original-marve-rivals-characters-director-says-stay-tuned/">NetEase</a> has announced that it'll drop onto last-gen consoles with its arrival on PS4 alongside the release of the game's Season 4: The Heart of the Dragon on September 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The confirmation comes with a new cinematic trailer for Season 4, which lists the PS4 alongside the rest of its platforms at the end of the trailer. Unfortunately for Xbox One players, they're currently left out of the fun, though that could change with a similarly surprising announcement in a future Marvel Rivals update. </p>

<p>Marvel Rivals has been one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">most popular games this year</a> after its arrival in December 2024, and its arrival on PS4 could potentially see another peak to its popularity that just wasn't possible on current-gen only consoles, especially when considering the fact that it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nearly-five-years-into-the-ps5-generation-there-are-more-players-on-ps5-monthly-than-ps4-sony-confirms/">only this past June</a> when Sony was able to confirm that there were more PS5 players active on a monthly basis than PS4 players. Even major games like Genshin Impact are <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">only starting to wind down their PS4 support now</a>.</p>



<p>The PS4 may be a last-gen console, but there are still millions of players who, for one reason or another, have not yet upgraded to a PS5 or Xbox Series console and jumped into the current-gen. </p>

			<p>IO Interactive's <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/">highly anticipated</a> 007 First Light is due to have another deep dive later today during a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/01/state-of-play-presents-007-first-light-gameplay-deep-dive-on-september-3/">State of Play</a> event focused entirely on gameplay in the Hitman studio's take on James Bond, and a few details about the game have leaked ahead of the showcase, though nothing to do with how the game will play.</p>



<p>From prominent and reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580">Billbil-kun</a>, the price for the standard edition of 007 First Light appeared on an Amazon listing, which pins the game at $70 USD for the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 editions. That marks it as another game where players don't have to worry about spending $80 to play it, but if you wanted more than just the game, IO Interactive is more than happy to oblige with a collector's edition, with a price set at a whopping $300.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ðŸš¨ EXCLUSIVE - 2026 ðŸš¨</p><p>007 First Light from IO Interactive will be released in Physical format + Collectors Edition</p><p>And you can even pre-order them from now!</p><p>ðŸ”¸ Standard Edition (PS5, Xbox Series, Switch 2): 69.99 US$</p><p>ðŸ”¹ Collectors: 299.99 US$<br>- PS5: <a href="https://t.co/65g723UT7x">https://t.co/65g723UT7x</a></p></div>â€” billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>We don't yet know what that $300 price tag gets you besides a copy of the game, though if it's anything like other collector's editions, the remaining $230 likely covers the cost of a statue or figure representative of the game's charming protagonist and a few other bits and bobs for the biggest James Bond enthusiasts to enjoy.</p>



<p>What's perhaps more intriguing for those looking forward to 007 First Light, is that if price information has leaked hours ahead of today's gameplay deep dive, then that means we are likely hours away from learning the game's official release date. We already know the <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/">game is due out in 2026</a>, but IO Interactive has refrained from saying when in 2026 we'll be able to order our 'shaken, not stirred' vodka martini's. Hopefully, we'll find out today.</p>
