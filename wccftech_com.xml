			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Polyphony Digital have revealed that My First Gran Turismo, the free trial for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Turismo 7</a>, will go live on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 tomorrow. Game creator and legendary designer Kazunori Yamauchi explained the purpose of My First Gran Turismo in a post <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p><em>My First Gran Turismo is a special free-to-play invitation to dive into the exhilarating world of motorsports. This experience holds a special place in my heart, as it pays tribute to the origins of the first Gran Turismo, where players of all generations discovered the joys of driving. Whether it’s introducing kids to the joy of racing for the first time or reigniting a forgotten passion for driving, My First Gran Turismo was designed to be both approachable and immersive, created for everyone, with no limits on age or driving skill level.</em></p>
<p><em>This isn’t just about playing a game; it’s about embarking on a personal driving journey. We’ve made sure the experience is intuitive, allowing anyone to get behind the wheel and master the essentials, such as cornering, braking, and acceleration. By playing it, users will build confidence one lap at a time, tackling new challenges that’ll steadily refine their driving skills.</em></p>

<p>The My First Gran Turismo trial will feature three Race Events, three Time Trials, three Music Rally stages, a full suite of License Tests, eighteen unique cars, and these three tracks: Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit. Owners of PS VR2 can also look forward to checking out the trial in virtual reality mode.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's still no news about a PC version. Two years ago, Yamauchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a statement that ignited the hopes of PC gamers; however, he quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-7-pc-isnt-actually-in-development-confirms-yamauchi-series-has-sold-90-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recanted</a>, clarifying that while they were open to the possibility, nothing was being worked on at the time.</p>
<p>It's strange because Sony is slowly but surely porting all of its exclusives to PC. At this point, Gran Turismo 7 might be the biggest missing one, and it's all the weirder because adding such a big platform could definitely help fill out the online races.</p>
