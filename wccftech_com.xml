			<p>Despite Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake doing better than anticipated, Square Enix still reported a drop in video game profits by almost 10% over the past year.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3slides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> for the first nine months of the current fiscal year ending on March 31st, the Japanese publisher confirmed net sales for its Digital Entertainment sector have dropped 10.7% and operating income 9.9% due to the weak performance of mobile and browser-based games and to the low sales of games released this year compared to the sales of those released the previous fiscal year, including the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince. Still, some of the publisher's new releases did well, as the Dragon Quest HD-2D Remake sold better than expected. The Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail expansion also sold well and has driven an increase in the MMO segment profits over the previous year.</p>
<p>The results reported in the latest financial report aren't particularly surprising, considering how Square Enix reported last September how sales of<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-underperformed-disappointing-profits/"> Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth did not meet expectations</a>, expectations that were reportedly reasonable this time. Thankfully, the second entry in the Remake trilogy seems to be doing quite well on<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-had-great-steam-launch-best-selling-game-of-the-week-ending-jan-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PC</a>, so there's the chance that sales will eventually meet the publisher's expectations. It definitely would be a shame for such a good game to be considered a failure in terms of sales.</p>

			<p>Despite the long silence, the Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate development team is still hard at work on it, and more information will be revealed slowly over time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-12-is-still-fully-in-development-new-information-to-be-revealed-little-by-little-says-series-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton</a> today, series creator Yuji Horii commented on the game during the latest livestream held with his radio show group KosoKoso Hoso Kyuoku over the weekend, saying that the development team is still hard at work on the game, and he hopes to reveal more information on the game little by little. Sadly, the legendary game designer did not say anything more on the matter, but still, it's good to hear that Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate is still in the works, as it has been a very long time since we got a solid update on the game.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the next main entry in the long-running JRPG series, other than the fact that it will be powered by Unreal Engine 5 and that<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-is-being-co-developed-by-orca-dev-is-recruiting-unreal-engine-5-staff/"> Orca is co-developing the game</a>. The Japanese studio previously worked on Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age and its Definitive Edition, so it's not surprising to see them back working on the next entry in the series, which promises to shake up things considerably, as it will feature an overhauled version of the series' trademark command battle system.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate isn't the only entry in the series to be in the works. Later this year, the Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D remakes will be released on PC and consoles, continuing the Erdrick saga following the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">remake of the third entry in the series</a> released last November.</p>

			<p>Despite some streamlining over its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is most definitely not the most accessible role-playing game around. Following the long introduction, where you are taught the very basics of the experience, the game essentially leaves you on your own to figure everything out by experimenting, which can lead to frustration, as at the beginning of the game, Henry is not very good at anything, and the poor gear in your possession will help you little in combat. Thankfully, there is a quest you can complete that will give you a decent headstart in the game and help you have fun even during the first few hours of the adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210113926_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To complete the Wedding Crashers main story quest, which is the very first quest you have to complete after Henry and Hans part ways in Troskowitz, you have two different options - either get into the wedding part with the help of the blacksmith Radovan or with the help of the miller Kreyzl. If you are a newcomer to the series, and you are feeling overwhelmed by the many mechanics, the game is already asking you to understand at the beginning of the adventure, your best choice is to ask for Radovan's help for a few reasons.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210112934_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After reaching Tachov to the north of Troskowitz and speaking with Radovan, you will learn how to craft items, which is an excellent way to earn a few Groschen and purchase items you may need, such as food. Don't spend your money on weapons and gear yet, however, as you will soon after get the chance to obtain plenty of free gear.</p>
<p>After completing the blacksmithing tutorial, you will not only get a free bed, allowing you to rest and recover health as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-how-to-save-at-any-time-without-using-savior-schnapps-potions/">save your game</a> without having to use a Saviour Schnapps potion, but you will also get access to an additional Kingdom Come: Deliverance II story quest called The Jaunt where Henry will join the lord of Semine and his faithful guard Sir Gnarly to track down a lost cart.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210112909_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before venturing forth with the two men, you should head over to the stables, where you can reunite with Pebbles, Henry's horse, potentially for free if you can pass a skill check. Otherwise, you can purchase the horse for a relatively low sum or even try to steal the horse and register it to yourself by the Horse handler in the Nomad Camp to the east of Semine, although you will still need some Groschen to do so. If you are stealing, however, it may make more sense to steal a better horse than Pebbles at this point and then reclaim him at a later time when you have the coin.</p>
<p>While it will take more time to complete the quest, you can complete The Jaunt quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II without a horse, so if you are not able to reclaim Pebbles, you should definitely still proceed. After traveling through a few different locations, Henry and the two older men will have to fight some bandits, and if you don't feel confident in your combat skills yet, you can choose to stay in the back and shoot the bandits from afar with a crossbow. Once the bandits are dead, you can loot them of their possessions, which includes weapons and gear that are more than decent to give you a headstart in the game. With this gear, you should have no trouble completing a few other essentially starting quests, which include the Combat Training I quest, where you can learn the extremely useful Master Strike ability, and the Mutt quest to find Henry's loyal canine companion.</p>

			<p>Mere days after its debut, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 already has a thriving modding community. We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> a lot of convenience mods to make the game a bit less tedious for those who don't enjoy that side of the franchise. Now, it's time for the first graphics enhancement mods. Nexus Mods user SweeJ24 has uploaded a 3.4GB <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/263?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skins mod</a> that greatly increases the skin details of the game's characters by replacing all faces and all body diffuse textures for both males and females. There are reportedly minor seams at the moment, but the detail enhancement is already big, making it more than worthwhile. The default textures in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 are 1K, so the mod offers a 4x resolution improvement.</p>
<p><iframe title="CRT FACES" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACAvdOyjbDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the author, the initial load might be a little longer, but afterward, it should be the same as vanilla. They also did not report any performance impact, although that was with the GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card.</p>
<p>No doubt there will be many more graphics mods coming to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The game was a resounding success both critically and commercially (it has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> one million units, recouping development costs). The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a perfect score</a> here on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>If I were honest with myself, I don't think I've ever enjoyed an open-world game in the same way I have Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Or, more accurately, the last time a game ever felt this transformational as to what I would expect from an open-world RPG of this nature was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion almost twenty years ago. The Witcher III is up there, but even that doesn't feel as responsive as this.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-with-neural-shaders-is-out-now-mega-geometry-and-neural-texture-compression-demos-available/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-rtx-kit-with-neural-shaders-is-out-now-mega-geometry-and-neural-texture-compression-demos-available.1104699/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-with-neural-shaders-is-out-now-mega-geometry-and-neural-texture-compression-demos-available/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few days after the originally intended launch window of late January, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Kit</a> has finally been released to the public for the most part. NVIDIA RTX Kit can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTX-Kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GitHub</a>, though each component also has a dedicated repository. This includes what was arguably the most exciting and future-facing technology: RTX Neural Shaders, now abbreviated as <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXNS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXNS</a>. Here's the excerpt from its dedicated GitHub page:</p>
<p><em>The sample is intended as a starting point for developers interested in bringing Machine Learning (ML) to their graphics applications. It provides a number of examples to help the reader understand how to train their own neural networks and then use those models to perform inference alongside their normal graphics rendering.</em></p>
<p><em>RTXNS uses the Slang shading language and it utilises the Vulkan Cooperative Vectors extension to provide access to the GPUs ML acceleration.</em></p>
<p>RTX Neural Materials is not yet available as part of the RTX Kit suite, but practically everything else is. For example, RTX Neural Texture Compression includes a demo sample that can be compiled to demonstrate the memory-saving technology. Compusemble did just that, finding massively reduced memory consumption (from 272 to 11.37 MB), although there is a performance cost associated when enabling the NTC AI inference model.</p>
<p><iframe title="First Look At RTX Neural Texture Compression (BETA) On RTX 4090" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9VAloduypg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Similarly, RTX Mega Geometry (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXMG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXMG</a>) can be tested by compiling a new sample. This is the only technology that's already been used in a game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>), but the tech demo is nonetheless interesting.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry Tech Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Js-ps14csLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>RTX Character Rendering (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXCR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXCR</a>) is also available, providing a sample of how to render path traced hair and skin. Hair is particularly interesting because, with the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards, NVIDIA introduced hardware support for a new hair data structure called Linear-Swept Sphere (LSS). According to NVIDIA, this delivers high performance in tracing and BVH updates while maintaining exceptionally low memory consumption. Compared to Disjoint Orthogonal Triangle Strips (DOTS), rendering animated hair on humans is about 2x faster with LSS and requires one-fifth of the VRAM. We'll see the first example of RTX Hair with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle February update</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The RTX Kit also includes one technology that NVIDIA had not previously discussed at CES 2025: RTX Texture Filtering (<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/RTXTF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTXTF</a>). According to NVIDIA, RTXTF randomly samples textures after shading and filters difficult volumes, reducing artifacts and improving image quality.</p>
<p>Lastly, NVIDIA also <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Streamline/releases/tag/v2.7.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated its Streamline SDK to version 2.7.2</a>, adding support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the new models for Ray Reconstruction, Frame Generation, and Super Resolution. This means we might soon see the first DLSS 4 mods.</p>
