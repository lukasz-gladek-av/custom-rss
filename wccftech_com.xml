			<p>This year has been a horrible one for people in the games industry, as there has been nonstop layoffs across the board. From big companies to indie developers, it doesn't seem like anyone has been spared from it. It's been announced that Deck Nine, the developers behind recently released title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> has laid off more staff. This isn't even the first time this year for Deck Nine, as they experienced layoffs earlier in the year, too.</p>
<p>A statement was shared on the<a href="https://x.com/DeckNineGames/status/1865138496601575468" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Deck Nine X page</a>, where a statement was made by Mark Lyons, the CEO of the company. The message reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, we are sad to share the news that we must say goodbye to some of our talented team members. This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing. We are extremely grateful to every individual who has dedicated their hard work, passion, and commitment to making transformative entertainment with us.<br>
To those of you leaving the studio to these changes, thank you for sharing your talents with us. We are proud of what we were able to accomplish together and we are committed to supporting you in this transition in any way we can.<br>
To the community, we ask for your support and understanding during this difficult time."</p>
<p>At the moment, the reason behind the layoffs hasn't been stated, but it is possible that it's due to the fact that Life is Strange: Double Exposure didn't perform to their expectations, as a lot of people were disappointed with the narrative and especially the ending of the game.</p>
<p>The gaming industry has seen more than 14,600 confirmed jobs lost across 175+ companies in 2024. The most recent layoffs that we saw confirmed were layoffs at Ubisoft that happened earlier in the week, where nearly 300 people have been confirmed to be laid off at the company due to studios within Ubisoft being shut down due to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/"> XDefiant officially closing down next year</a>. They are also due to experience more layoffs in February, most likely related to the closure of the studios.</p>
<p>It's not been clarified how many people have been laid off at Deck Nine Games, with their number of staff already being relatively small. In February, they laid off roughly 20% of their staff. Combining that with this new layoff, it's hard to know how many staff members will be left at the company.</p>
