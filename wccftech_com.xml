			<p>There's no doubt that, even with all of Epic's efforts over the last few years, Steam remains by far the biggest online gaming store on PC. Not only that, but it also appears to be more convenient for game developers, even with Valve demanding 30% of everyone's revenue. In contrast, Epic only takes 12% (and, starting last month, only after they have passed the first million in revenue, which is completely free of charge).</p>



<p>Why is that the case? <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/06/03/most-people-who-buy-your-game-wont-play-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Steam and games industry analyst Chris Zukowski</a>, Valve successfully cultivated a user base of hoarders who buy games they don't actually play, for the most part.</p>



<p><em>Valve cracked the problem that Netflix was struggling with: how do you sell to people who have so much entertainment at their fingertips that they don’t have enough hours in the day to play and watch it all. Valve basically added infinite hours to a gamer’s day, it is a theoretical future day where gamers might someday spend hours playing your game (but let’s be honest, won’t).</em></p>



<p><em>The reason game developers are willing to give Valve 30% of their revenue is because the Steam marketplace is packed with super gamers who throw money at games they have no intention of playing. When I ran a survey of games that participated in Steam Next Fest, I found that for the median game most people only wishlist a game without even playing the demo. THE DEMO IS FREE! If players are so interested in the game, why don’t they play it!</em></p>



<p>We have one such example among our staff, actually. Our own <a href="https://wccftech.com/author/chriswray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Wray</a> owns 6,062 games on Steam, but only launched around 20% of them, as you can see <a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561197977871270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on SteamDB</a>. Needless to say, his backlog is the stuff of legends. Sure, he didn't buy all the games (some we provided for the reviews), but that's only a minor percentage. For the most part, he purchased them on his own.</p>



<p>Steam does have some of the deepest discounts available for PC games, such as those seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the current Summer Sale</a>. By the way, that's ending tomorrow, just in case you're looking to buy some games you're never going to play.</p>



<p>On a more serious note, are you also afflicted with this hoarding disease? Vote in the poll and let us know below!</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-now-last-five-seasons-after-immensely-surprising-popularity-say-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explosive popularity of the Fallout TV show</a>, fans started clamoring for new games in the beloved post-apocalyptic franchise. Of course, that was far from easy to accomplish for Bethesda Game Studios, which had just about started production on the long-awaited The Elder Scrolls VI. T<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here were some hints from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a> that Bethesda was considering how to fast-track new games. Still, Bethesda's Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-games-wont-be-rushed-says-howard-bethesda-game-studios-had-25-million-players-last-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> shortly afterward that the games wouldn't be rushed out to meet some arbitrary deadline, like the show's second season.</p>



<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lap5F8SnoXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the latest episode of the Friends Per Second podcast on the Skill Up YouTube channel</a>, VideoGamesChronicles' Jordan Middler teased that there are indeed multiple Fallout projects in the works, including 'the one everyone wants'. However, as we already knew, the next mainline entry is still far away.</p>



<p><em>Fallout is the big one. I cannot believe that they didn't immediately start work on a Fallout 5, because Todd's not going to make it. Todd is not going to make it. He's not going to make the game. May well make it to that point of life, hopefully at the time of recording, but when he's done with the next Elder Scrolls, I can fully see him being like, "Okay, I'm done. I'm an older guy now." There are multiple Fallout projects in development, including, as far as I'm aware, that one you're all wanting. But it's not far enough along to say anything that is like, "You're going to be playing this game anytime soon." Fallout 5 should have been day one.</em></p>



<p>Now, regarding Howard's involvement, Meddler is definitely speculating. As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason to believe he wouldn't be involved in Fallout 5. He is around 55 years old, and The Elder Scrolls VI will likely launch by 2028, leaving him with enough time in his career to make another big game - the next Fallout installment, which we already know will follow TES VI.</p>



<p>As for the other projects, one is most likely the Fallout 3 remaster that was originally discovered during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial. Another project could be a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, especially since the Amazon Prime Video show's season two <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-is-100-canon-and-doesnt-retcon-new-vegas-says-bethesda-deathclaws-are-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is heading to Vegas</a>. There's been some speculation that Obsidian <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could be handed the reins of a full-fledged New Vegas sequel</a>, but that rumor is over three and a half years old now and Obsidian is very busy with its own projects.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-settles-lawsuit-samsung-auto-blocker/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-settles-lawsuit-with-samsung-on-auto-blocker-feature.1238946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games president and majority stakeholder Tim Sweeney announced that his company has settled the antitrust lawsuit it <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in September 2024</a> against Samsung. Writing on X, he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1942259929865420855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>We’re dismissing our court case against Samsung following the parties’ discussions. We are grateful that Samsung will address Epic’s concerns.</em></p>



<p>Epic's concerns were related to Samsung's introduction of the Auto Blocker security feature, which launched with the One UI 6.0 update. Auto Blocker was originally added in October 2023 as an opt-in feature that would disable app installation from sources other than the Samsung Galaxy Store and the Google Play Store. However, in July 2024, Auto Blocker became enabled by default. Epic Games stated:</p>



<p><em>Auto Blocker defaulting to “on” requires an exceptionally onerous 21 step process to download an app outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store, mirroring Google’s “Unknown Sources” process with multiple steps and scare screens. Auto Blocker is the first time that Samsung has imposed additional friction on consumers who try to get apps outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store.</em></p>



<p><em>Auto Blocker undermines the jury’s unanimous decision in Epic v. Google, specifically that “Google entered into one or more agreements that unreasonably restrained trade in a relevant antitrust market” including “Agreements with OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] that sell mobile devices”.</em></p>



<p>Epic Games is, of course, referring to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wins-landmark-anticompetitive-lawsuit-against-google-with-unanimous-verdict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic win in the anticompetitive lawsuit against Google</a>, dating back to December 11, 2023, when Judge James Donato of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Google had violated antitrust laws by maintaining the Play Store as the dominant storefront for Android. This included making deals to ensure that apps would be published exclusively through the Play Store and requiring that the Play Store be installed on third-party devices. The Judge also ordered Google to allow alternative app stores on the Android system and temporarily prohibited them from offering monetary incentives to developers who release exclusively on the Play Store.</p>



<p>The Epic Games Store eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on Android and iOS</a> (although only in Europe in the latter case, at least for now) on August 16, 2024, following Epic's strenuous legal efforts against Google and Apple.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening Guide – How Fast Travel Works]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>You might not be able to sandwalk like a Fremen in Dune: Awakening, but there are ways of getting around Arrakis besides your own two feet, including fast travel. </p>



<p>It's not immediately obvious that fast travel is in Dune: Awakening, but it is there. You don't need to use it, though, and there's a real question as to whether you should be using it at all. </p>



<p>This guide will take you through all of that; how fast travel works, where it can take you, and if you should be using it at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-guide-how-fast-travel-works">Dune: Awakening Guide - How Fast Travel Works</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-fast-travel-works-in-dune-awakening">How Fast Travel Works in Dune: Awakening</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unlike other open-world games with large maps to cross, you cannot fast travel whenever you like in Dune: Awakening. It's only available when you make it to your first trade post in the southern region of Hagga Basin. </p>



<p>You can fast travel from any trade post, but it only unlocks once you've reached the first one, Griffin's Reach. Fast travel works by hiring a pilot to fly you to Harko Village, the Harkonnen base on Arrakis, or Arrakeen, the city where the Atreides have taken refuge. Both areas are social hubs where you can meet other players, though more significantly, they house plenty of important NPCs you need to speak to, like advanced-level trainers for Trooper and Mentat skill trees.</p>



<p>It'll cost you 2,500 Solaris for the pilot to fly you to either Harko Village or Arrakeen, but at least your return trip to whichever trade post you'd like to fly back to will be free. The pilot will also be able to fly you to different trade posts in Hagga Basin, such as the Anvil or Pinnacle Station, though there's still a cost to that. A more reasonable 700 Solaris will get you between different trade posts. </p>



<p>You also can't use the pilot to fly you to a trade post you've not been to before. You have to make it there yourself by some other means before being able to fast travel from one trade post to another.</p>



<h3 id="h-should-you-use-fast-travel-in-dune-awakening">Should You Use Fast Travel in Dune: Awakening?</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are two answers to this question, and the one that's right for you depends on where you are in the game. Basically, if you have yet to craft your own ornithopter, then yes, you should be using fast travel, though that's also because you have to. You can't access Arrakeen or Harko Village any other way, save for landing there with an ornithopter.</p>



<p>If you have already crafted your own ornithopter, then you don't need to use the pilot, and you can select travelling to Arrakeen or Harko Village as a form of fast travel, since there's no other way to access either settlement.</p>



<p>When you're going from one trade post to another, unless you're immediately near a trade post and have the 700 Solaris to spare, you might find it better to just get there yourself, especially if you have your own ornithopter. Being able to fly anywhere at any time is the *real* fast travel in Dune: Awakening.</p>
