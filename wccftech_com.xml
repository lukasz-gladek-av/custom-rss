			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/">Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One</a> was one of the standout VR games in 2024, and for Alien fans with a VR headset to play it, it was the kind of Alien game those fans had been waiting for since Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Rogue Incursion developer Survios announced that Alien fans without VR headsets will soon be able to join the fun, with Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, a flatscreen version of the original VR game, arriving on September 30, 2025, for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now, with the standard edition coming in at $29.99 USD and the deluxe edition which includes a digital art book and a weapon and armor skin costs $39.99 USD.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ho3DAL11eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Rogue Incursion is re-tooled from being a VR game since so much of the original experience was clearly designed for VR. The trailer Survios released today looks like it's showing footage captured in the game's engine, but it doesn't look like actual gameplay.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is still just part one of a two-part story, a fact that wasn't clear ahead of Rogue Incursion's original release. When Part One launched, Survios released a <a href="https://x.com/Survios/status/1870484344768172495">statement</a> to players saying that it understood why the last-minute addition of the 'Part One' subtitle to the game's full title was negatively interpreted by players, adding that it did not "<em>intend to mislead or cause confusion about what this game is</em>."</p>
<p>It also clarified that it didn't cut the game short or in half, and that this was always the plan, though for whatever reason, the words 'Part One' were not publicly added to the title until after the game launched.</p>
<p>Now that we know Survios has been working on a flatscreen version of Part One alongside the development of Part Two now brings up the question of whether Part Two will be available as a VR headset first, and a flatscreen game later, or if it'll be playable with or without a VR headset at launch.</p>

			<p>The action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has had its early access launch shifted to Summer 2025, developer Grimlore Games <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1920515492902551765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. A crowded release window and the desire to improve the game based on the community's feedback mixed to push the studio toward this choice.</p>
<p>Still, the developers said the recent demo playtest was very successful. Thousands of players participated, streamed, and completed surveys. Grimlore said that over 92% of these playtesters rated their experience as positive or very positive, with long-time franchise fans particularly enthusiastic about capturing the spirit of the original while moving forward with modernized systems.</p>
<p>The playtest featured the game's introductory chapter, where players could choose between two masteries and face the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible - a battle that proved a fan favourite. The visuals and audio received outstanding marks, with average scores of 5.25/6 and 5.16/6, respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p>
<p>Not all was great, though, which is why Titan Quest II was delayed. Combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balance were all in need of improvements, which Grimlore said are being addressed, while performance optimization continues. Additionally, a customizable control scheme and revamped user interface indicators are underway based on the community's suggestions.</p>
<p>In the game, players will have to face against Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, who is inexplicably out of control. She is corrupting the threads of fate and condemning all those who oppose her to eternal punishment - including the main character. Players must pick up their weapon, fight alongside the gods, and change fate itself to stop Nemesis, free those she's punished, and weave their own epic tale.</p>
<p>They'll get to create their own class by combining two of the masteries, forging a unique hybrid playstyle thanks to different combinations of skill modifiers, attributes, and items.</p>
