			<p>Although WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike game through and through, the hardcore action role-playing game developed by Leenzee Games twists some of the formula's mechanics to offer something unique. Among these twisted mechanics are the block and parry mechanics, which work quite differently from what you may be used to.</p>



<p>Besides dodging, which you should master as soon as possible, as it is the best way to get the Skyborn Might resource used to use special skills like Discipline Skills and magic spells, you have no other defensive mechanics as you begin your journey to find a cure for the Feathering affliction. <strong>To block or parry an attack, you will have to make some progress in the game.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>Blocking in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers in only available with Axes</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To block enemy attacks </strong>in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, you will need to find axes, as these heavy weapons are the only ones that can block. After equipping one, all you need to do to<strong> </strong>block an enemy attack is hold the L2 button on a PlayStation controller or the Left Trigger on an Xbox controller. Blocking will not completely negate damage, but it's still a solid defensive option as it doesn't require any particular timing to use.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deflection requires great timing in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, but those who master it are mightily rewarded</figcaption></figure>



<p>Parrying enemy attacks in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a little more complex, as you get two different options to do so: <strong>Deflects and Clashes</strong>. Deflecting attacks requires you to learn a specific Discipline Skill available for Longswords, Dual Blades, and Spears, and to press the button usually used for blocking with Axe, so L2/ Left Trigger, at the exact time an enemy attack connects with Wuchang. A successful deflection completely nullifies the attack.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Clashing in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a great way to mitigate damage while attacking enemies</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Clashes</strong>, on the other hand, fit perfectly with the always-on-the-offense strategy you should often employ in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers. Instead of pressing the block button at the same time an enemy attack connects, to perform a clash, one of your attacks has to connect with the enemy's weapon, deflecting most of the incoming damage. Like for Deflection, you will have to learn certain skills on the Impetus Repository to add clashing properties to regular light attacks and to charged light attacks. Though damage is not negated with clashing, the timing is a little more forgiving than Deflection skills, so it's still a viable option to use, especially if you know enemy tendencies well and want to stay on the offensive as much as possible.</p>

			<p>Borderlands 4 has officially gone gold, and will launch next month as previously announced.</p>



<p>Today, Gearbox and publisher 2K confirmed the fourth entry in the series has gone gold, securing its September 12 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Although we have seen games getting delayed even after going gold, like in Cyberpunk 2077's case <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/">five years ago</a>, these are very rare cases, so there's little doubt at this point fans will be able to get their hands on the game in a little over a month.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Borderlands 4 is also coming to Nintendo Switch 2, but owners of the new generation system by Nintendo will have to wait until October 3 to play the game, as confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">earlier this week</a>. Considering the differences with the other current generation systems, it will be very interesting to see how the Nintendo Switch 2 will handle the game and if it will take advantage of any of its features like NVIDIA DLSS support and mouse controls, which would work extremely well for a game like this.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12. It will also hit Nintendo Switch 2 on October 3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has just announced a four-week delay for its upcoming first-person open world action/adventure game Dying Light: The Beast. The game was scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-launches-on-august-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on August 22</a> and will now be released on September 19. As you might expect, the reason is that it needs more polish (no pun intended).</p>



<p>The team shared a message with the Dying Light community:</p>



<p><em>It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</em></p>



<p><em>We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Dying Light 2: Stay Human wasn't as well received as the first game. Granted, Techland kept working on it and improving it for years, but the early reception certainly left a mark on the Polish studio. They would not want a repeat of that.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was recently featured in a fresh round of previews, including a hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on Wccftech</a> and written by Kai Tatsumoto. If you're attending Gamescom, the game will be playable in Hall 6. Even if you're not going to Cologne, Techland will continue to share more information about the game. Next week, they'll publish a new development diary about how they handled gore in this new title, narrated by the fan-favorite 'Bober the Beaver'.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-rated-in-south-korea/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-rated-in-south-korea.1253061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond may finally be on its way to gamers. The <span>South Korean rating board, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank">GRAC</a>&nbsp;(Game Rating and Administration Committee), has just rated the game</span>, hinting at a relatively close release date.</p>



<p>The GRAC has often 'leaked' release date announcements. For example, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its rating on February 6, and the game's launch date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> around one month later, on March 9. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach was then released on June 26.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4's launch date could therefore be announced in the coming weeks, whether at a Nintendo Direct, Gamescom, or even the Tokyo Game Show, for a late 2025 launch. Of course, an early 2026 date is also entirely possible.</p>



<p>Either way, this listing seemingly contradicts a rumor pushed a few hours ago by Reece 'KiwiTalks' Reilly, who <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1947809648700002346#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> there was no official release date because the game still wasn't finished. That seems highly unlikely given that the GRAC already put out its rating.</p>



<p>By the way, the game was rated '12 years old and up' by the South Korean rating board:</p>



<p><em>A first-person adventure game set on the planet Buros, where Samus Aran was transferred after an unexpected situation arose following her encounter with Silux at a Galactic Federation research facility.</em></p>



<p><em>Mild violence (using weapons attached to the suit to attack alien lifeforms).</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's development was very troublesome. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the original Nintendo Switch in June 2017. Back then, it had been assigned to an external studio, Bandai Namco, but their work did not satisfy Nintendo. The Japanese company decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot the project</a> and hand it back to the historic Metroid Prime caretaker: Retro Studios.</p>



<p>Now, at long last, the finishing line appears to be in sight. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to play the game</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event and came away rather positive about it:</p>



<p><em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</em></p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also be available for the original Switch, by the way, as per the original announcement.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix%E2%80%99s-final-fantasy-office-for-a-%E2%80%98creatively-rich-exchange-of-ideas%E2%80%99.1253046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Some of the key developers behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 have visited Square Enix's offices to meet with the Final Fantasy team. The confirmation <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1948389582665547854?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came</a> from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, who posted a picture of the two groups posing with a Cloud Strife standee.</p>



<p>According to Hamaguchi-san, the two groups engaged in a 'creatively rich exchange of visions and ideas' during the meeting. This will no doubt fuel Final Fantasy fans' hopes that Square Enix might reconsider its stance on turn-based combat.</p>



<p>The most recent games in the franchise have effectively shunned the traditional combat system in favor of action-based combat, as seen in Final Fantasy XVI, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> back in 2022 that the ever-improving realistic graphics was making it increasingly harder for some gamers to accept the inherently not-so-realistic nature of turn-based combat.</p>



<p>However, the success story of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proves that wrong</a>. Granted, Square Enix would have much higher sales targets for mainline Final Fantasy titles, and Sandfall Interactive's game doesn't use a traditional turn-based system anyway (dodges and parries are performed in real-time). Even so, it's obvious there is a market for this, as shown even by Baldur's Gate 3. Even though that was a Western cRPG, it still used turn-based combat mixed with fairly realistic graphics (perspective notwithstanding) to enormous acclaim.</p>



<p>Did Square Enix ask Sandfall Interactive for tips on how they made it work? Or, better yet, did they discuss a potential partnership on a new project? Co-development is all the rage nowadays throughout the gaming industry, so we wouldn't be surprised at all.</p>



<p>Of course, even if that were the case, it would be a long way from releasing. Nevertheless, it'll be interesting to see whether Square Enix eventually relents to fans to provide a new game with at least the option to play with turn-based fights.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Story of The Last of Us Part I and II Will Be Available in Book Form Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/story-the-last-of-us-available-book-form/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-story-of-the-last-of-us-part-i-and-ii-will-be-available-in-book-form-later-this-year.1253001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you cannot stand video games and TV shows and would like to know what all the fuss regarding The Last of Us is about, the entire story so far will be available in book form later this year. Of course, it's also a perfectly valid option for those who already know the story through different mediums and would like to read it from the perspective of script writers Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross (the latter worked just on Part II).</p>



<p>The hardcover is already available for pre-order <a href="https://amzn.to/46WmXgE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Amazon</a>. It is estimated to be released on December 16, and the price of $69.99 is currently discounted to $66.63 (5% off). Dark Horse Books publishes the book, which is 616 pages long.</p>



<p>Here's the product overview:</p>



<p><em>Join Joel and Ellie from the very beginning of their unforgettable journey. Relive every climactic moment from The Last of Us Part I, from the duo’s time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie’s joy while petting giraffes, to Joel’s heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies’ hospital. And dive into The Last of Us Part II’s dual-perspective story, including Abby’s shocking introduction to the story, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby.</em></p>



<p><em>This volume contains the script from both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II, as well as the DLC, Left Behind, so you can experience every bottle thrown, every bad pun of Ellie’s, and every heart-pounding encounter with the Infected in a totally new way. Much like Savage Starlight was to Ellie, The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts is a must-have for any fan’s bookshelf (or survival kit).</em></p>



<p>The book also includes an art gallery featuring work by Naughty Dog principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, a buckram-textured cover, and block printing along the pages' edges that evokes the iconic Cordyceps fungus of The Last of Us.</p>



<p>The story as-is can be considered complete. As we previously reported, creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a third game would only be produced if Naughty Dog found a worthy story. Druckmann himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped back</a> from his additional role as co-showrunner of the HBO series, although HBO reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbo-not-concerned-neil-druckmann-departure-the-last-of-us-show-16-emmy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn't concerned</a> about his departure. Even so, the second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw a large decline </a>in viewership, and fans fear the third season will be even worse without the creator's handiwork.</p>
