			<p>Though rooted deeply into the hardcore action-RPG mechanics made popular by the Souls series, Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different sort of experience from what FromSoftware usually offers in its games. With a focus on co-op play and a time limit, playing the new game from the Japanese studio can feel overwhelming for those more used to the slower pace of typical soulslike.</p>
<p>To help you better understand the unique take on the Soulslike mechanics featured in Elden Ring Nightreign, and to start having fun just a few Expeditions in, here are a few tips that will be helpful as you run from one side of the other of Limveld, trying to stay one step ahead of the Night.</p>
<h2>1 - Plan For the Whole Game</h2>
<p>With the first two in-game days lasting only 15 minutes, you must upgrade your character as quickly as possible in Elden Ring Nightreign. As such, you will want to start planning what to do right from the start of a game. While the spectral hawk is carrying you to Limveld, open up the map and locate the most critical upgrades to have an easier time later in the game, and plan around their locations. Flask charges, situated inside the churches with a gold outline, are a must for survivability, so grab them as quickly as possible, possibly clearing a few other locations along the way to level up and get your first few upgrades. If you can, prioritize locations on the edges of the map, as there's a good chance they will no longer be available for the day once the Night approaches.</p>
<h2>2 - Level Up As Much as You Can</h2>
<p>While it can be tempting to explore an enemy camp or an enemy stronghold near your landing point at the start of the game, it's not a very good idea to head into them at a low level. Look around your starting location, find some mobs, and take them down to get some runes and level up to at least level 3 to have a much easier time. In Elden Ring Nightreign, character level matters a lot, as it not only increases stats but also allows your Nightfarer to wield weapons of higher rarity, so you will want to make some quick preparations before heading into any location guarded by bosses. Dying will also make you waste time, which you don't have a lot of in the game.</p>
<h2>3 - Ignore Mobs</h2>

<p>Killing mobs at the start of a game in Elden Ring Nightreign is the way to go to level up enough to handle bosses, but after reaching level 3, it's almost always a good idea to ignore all those mobs that aren't getting in the way. After a certain point, the runes you get from defeating them are not worth the time you need to dispose of them, which could be used to take down bosses, which give plenty of runes and offer you one between three different upgrades, which may be more crucial to defeating a Nightlord than runes to level up. This holds even more true when going through the Castle in the center of Limveld. This location is filled with enemies that reward Nightfarers with upgrades, so ignore the mobs to get to them as quickly as possible to reap some beneficial rewards.</p>
<h2>4 - Get a Ranged Combat Option</h2>
<p>By pressing the Triangle or Y button with the map open, you will be able to get more information on the upgrades that can be obtained in each location in Limveld, and you will be surprised by how many bows and ranged weapons can be found. There's a good reason for this: ranged combat options work great in Elden Ring Nightreign, as you have infinite ammo and can spam attack from a safe distance. Having to resort to healing as little as possible, taking out enemies from afar is extremely important, so make sure to get a ranged attack option for your character, no matter how good they may be at using it. The same goes for all magic spells, as they can make your life significantly easier under certain conditions. Most Nightlords don't leave themselves open too often, so having a ranged attack option is a great help against these powerful enemies as well.</p>
<h2>5 - Don't Go Off on Your Own</h2>
<p>Going off alone in Elden Ring Nightreign can be tempting, especially if you have uncollaborative companions, but doing so is never a good idea. Always stick together with your fellow Nightfarers, as there's nothing that you can do by yourself that can help the team as a whole. For example, you may defeat some bosses by yourself, but your companions will not receive upgrades automatically, only runes, rendering your efforts almost useless, in the grand scheme of things. With more experienced Nightfarers and excellent team coordination, spreading out may be a viable strategy to take down multiple bosses and rush from one location to the next picking upgrades, but this requires a lot of game knowledge as well, which you will obviously lack at the start of your adventure in Limveld.</p>

			<p>We learned yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA had canceled its Black Panther game and shut down the team that was working on it, Cliffhanger Studios</a>. This immediately put into question the status of EA's other Marvel-based projects, like Motive Studios' Iron Man game.</p>
<p>However, according to statements from Marvel and EA that were sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-still-making-at-least-3-marvel-games-even-after-black-panther-cancellation">IGN</a>, the collaboration between the two companies "<em>remains strong,</em>" and EA is still committed to making three games based on Marvel characters, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-marvel-games-partner-3-new-action-adventure-games/">previously agreed to in 2022.</a></p>
<p>Originally, the three games would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">EA Motive's Iron Man game</a>, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game, and a third unannounced title. The Iron Man game is still in development, and, as far as we know right now, is still planned to be released.</p>
<p>"<em>Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues,</em>" said EA Entertainment president Laura Miele in a statement.</p>
<p>For Marvel's part, a spokesperson for the company said, "<em>The multi-title, long-term relationship between Marvel Games and EA, a creative collaboration focused on original storytelling with various, beloved Marvel characters, remains strong. Development of our console and PC titles, beginning with Marvel's Iron Man, is led by Motive Studios</em>."</p>
<p>So after the Iron Man game, it sounds like, at least for now, Motive Studios is on the hook for two more games based on a Marvel character. Whether we actually get those games is another question. If the Iron Man game flops, it wouldn't be surprising if the other projects are canceled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">Marvel's Avengers</a> definitively proved that putting big-name comic book characters in a video game does not guarantee success in today's MCU-led market.</p>
<p>But that's the less likely scenario, since Motive has an incredibly talented team and there are no signs that it will try to mash a bunch of unwanted live service-focused features into its <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">single-player</a> Iron Man game.</p>
<p>Which seemingly puts Motive Studios in a similar position to Respawn, with both studios locked into making three games based on Disney-owned franchises. Once the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">third Star Wars Jedi</a> title from Respawn and the third Marvel game from Motive are out, EA might finally move entirely away from making games based on licensed series, as chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">Andrew Wilson talked about</a>. Sorry to all <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront III</a> hopefuls.</p>
