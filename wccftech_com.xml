			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches today on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, exactly one year after its initial release on PC and Xbox Series S|X, following the end of the timed console exclusivity deal with Microsoft.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> an interview with GSC Game World focused on the PS5 launch, but we also asked about the content and features that are still to come. Ahead of last year's launch, the Ukrainian studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the game would eventually be updated with features like multiplayer, cross-platform mods, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing. However, twelve months later, there is still no news to share on that front. However, we did get confirmation that the first STALKER 2 DLC will launch at some point in 2026. As a reminder, the game's Ultimate Edition is still being sold with the promise that its Season Pass would include 'two future expansions and all upcoming DLCs'.</p>



<p>We also inquired about the announced upgrade to a newer version of Epic's Unreal Engine 5. </p>



<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> Switching to a new version of Unreal Engine 5 is a very big task, which is exactly why even in our roadmap we especially noted that we cannot guarantee the exact timing. It should bring a significant boost to optimization overall, but we will keep you updated on the timing of this update through our socials. But here I would like to note that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-update-1-7-adds-faction-turf-wars-expedition-mode-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.7</a> has already delivered a significant and very noticeable optimization gain, and it is available right now.</em></p>



<p>Finally, we wanted to know if GSC Game World was satisfied with the performance of STALKER 2 so far.</p>



<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One million copies sold in under three days</a>&nbsp;and several million players through Game Pass on PC and Xbox can undoubtedly be considered successful figures. Over the year, the game received 7 major updates — and far more smaller ones — which not only improved performance but also added new content. The game is now significantly different from what it was at launch. Updates are a complex matter. In the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., they could probably go on forever, much like the pursuit of perfection. Nevertheless, they will continue forward on.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Powered by NVIDIA technology, Nintendo Switch 2 games can leverage RTX tech like<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/"> NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing </a>to deliver better visuals and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">enhanced image quality at solid performance.</a> Since launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-nvidia-dlss-engine-limitations/">Nintendo's own titles had yet to take advantage of either,</a> but it seems like the ray tracing floodgates have been opened by the publisher's latest first-party title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>As confirmed by a screenshot of the game's license readme found in the Nintendo Switch 2's menu <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-is-the-first-nintendo-published-switch-2-game-to-support-ray-tracing-specifically-ray-traced-global-illumination.1358995/">shared on ResetERA</a>, Kirby Air Riders reportedly uses the RTXGI SDK, meaning that the racing game uses ray-traced global illumination in some capacity, making it the first proper Nintendo first-party game to do so.</p>



<p>While it's not yet known how Kirby Air Riders implements ray-traced global illumination, this is a very interesting find in light of how the Nintendo Switch 2 handles the game. According to our own Nathan Birch, the game not only looks gorgeous, but <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/">runs at a smooth 60 FPS even when the tracks become utterly chaotic</a>. As such, it will be interesting to see how this is achieved, and whether any upscaling technology, such as the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-nvidia-dlss-types-nintendo-switch-2/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, is also utilized to deliver the excellent image quality and solid performance the game exhibits at launch.</p>



<p>Although Kirby Air Riders is reportedly the first proper Nintendo game to use ray tracing in some capacity, this isn't the first time we could be witnessing ray tracing on Nintendo Switch 2. Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world game developed by Ubisoft based on the popular franchise, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-early-footage-analysis-highlights-need-for-ray-reconstruction/">also makes ample use of ray tracing</a>. Future third-party releases, such as Resident Evil Requiem, will likely utilize ray tracing in some capacity as well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-ray-tracing/">judging from currently available footage</a></p>

			<p>The price will be the critical factor that will determine the success of the Steam Machine, but those who expected the upcoming system to be priced in the same range as a console will likely be disappointed, judging from some new information shared online.</p>



<p><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnKy4UEdiyo&amp;t=2s">In the latest episode of Linus Tech Tips' WAN Show podcast</a>, Linus commented on the yet-to-be-revealed price for the system. While he doesn't know the price (as no one does yet), there are strong indications the system won't fall in the $500 price range of the current PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X systems, judging from the reaction of Valve's employees during a recent media event to show the system to press and creators.</p>



<p><em>"When I said I'm disappointed it isn't going to follow a console pricing model, where its subsided by the fact that manufacturer is going to be taking 30% of every game sold on it over the lifespan of this thing, because I feel that would be a more meaningful product, they asked what I meant by console price and I said $500. Nobody said anything, but the energy in the room wasn't great,"</em> Linus said during the podcast.</p>

<p>Although Valve said that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Steam Machine will be priced competitively with a PC of similar specs</a>, expecting a gaming PC in a console form factor to cost as much as a console is definitely a little unreasonable. As such, what happened at Valve's headquarters, as reported by Linus, shouldn't surprise anyone, especially in light of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-rumored-memory-price-hike-could-be-a-catastrophe-for-pc-gamers/">now expected massive RAM price increase</a> that will impact a wide range of hardware, including gaming hardware.</p>



<p>However, despite Valve believing that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/">a bigger game library will ensure the Steam Machine is more successful than its predecessors</a> and that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/">it will offer a better gaming experience than 70% of current gaming rigs</a>, pricing still needs to be right for the system to be successful. While it is true <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-rely-amd-fsr-4k-60/">it may have a hard time delivering a 4K@60 FPS gaming experience even with AMD FSR</a>, those who want to have a hassle-free gaming experience in the vein of consoles won't look at the system twice if it's priced too high, especially in the current climate where the price of living continues to rise worldwide.</p>
