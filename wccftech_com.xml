<p>However, if you were thinking about experiencing the original version of the game ahead of the remaster's release and can't track down a physical copy, <strong>you may be out of luck</strong>, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>As reported by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">multiple users on X</strong> and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-delists-multiple-metal-gear-solid-titles-with-no-warning.1437856/">ResetERA forums</a></strong>, the Japanese publisher has removed both <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em></span>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</em></strong> and its H<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">D remaster</strong> from digital stores without warning, making it <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">impossible for users to purchase these games digitally</strong>.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> launched in a <strong>rough state</strong> last year, with performance issues across the board that made it difficult for many to enjoy the latest entry in the series. Following multiple updates, however, <strong>the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/">game is in a much better state</a></strong>, especially on PC, and runs way more smoothly on a bigger number of system configurations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even so, <strong>the development team is not yet done improving the technical state of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>, as tomorrow's update will introduce additional <strong>CPU and GPU optimizations</strong> to reduce load and improve the overall experience.</p>



<p>These new optimizations have been confirmed by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">full update notes</strong> for update 1.041.00.00, which is scheduled to launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Wednesday, February 18, 2026, 2:30 a.m. UTC (Tuesday, February 17th, 2026, 6:30 p.m. PT)</strong>. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced CPU/GPU processing and made adjustments to lower the load on the game.</li>



<li>Added internal Levels of Detail (LOD) for 3D models, adjusting them to display optimal quality based on the situation to reduce GPU load.</li>



<li> Optimized monster and endemic life spawn-time processing to reduce CPU load.</li>



<li>Added effect caching to decrease CPU load when generating duplicate effects.</li>



<li>Optimized rendering processes to reduce CPU/GPU load.</li>



<li> Performed other minor adjustments to lower the overall load.</li>
</ul>



<p>Besides including these new CPU and GPU optimizations, <strong>the final major <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> update</strong> will introduce <strong>Arch-tempered Arkveld</strong> via a permanent Event Quest, and new <strong>10-star difficulty quests</strong> for Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad. It will also introduce a <strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission</strong>, along with plenty of other new features. You can find all the details on the game's <strong><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-asia/Ver.1.041.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website.</a></strong></p>



<p>With the final major update launching this week, the Monster Hunter Wilds development team is likely shifting its full focus to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-iceborne-sunbreak-sized-expansion-summer-2026-capcom/">Master Rank expansion confirmed last week</a></strong>. Hopefully, it will introduce interesting <strong>new mechanics</strong> on par with those of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/"><strong>Iceborne</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><strong>Sunbreak</strong></a></em>, besides additional monsters and a higher difficulty tier to their base games.</p>

			<p>While an official confirmation has yet to be made, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></strong> is very likely going to receive <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-insiders-are-corroborating-new-the-witcher-3-dlc-as-fans-believe-dlc-for-old-games-should-happen-more/"><strong>a new DLC expansion</strong></a> later this year. <span>Reportedly intended to bridge the gap between the third and upcoming fourth entries in the&nbsp;series, this new expansion is said to feature a&nbsp;new region,&nbsp;speculated to be&nbsp;<strong>Zerrikania</strong>.</span></p>



<p>According to a <strong>known Polish insider</strong>, however, people are <em>"looking too far away,"</em> suggesting the new explorable region will be <strong>closer to the regions</strong> we already have in the game, namely <strong>Velen</strong> and the <strong>Northern Kingdoms</strong>.</p>



<p>Commenting on old map design approaches in video games in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vQ4mx6fpDeE?si=4o6J6Smtw-CK65aB&amp;t=3335"><strong>a livestream</strong></a> earlier this month, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UVograch"><strong>UV o grach</strong></a>, a former Gry-Online journalist with solid connections with the <strong>Polish gaming industry</strong>, made some comments about <strong>reusing assets</strong> and filling in the blanks on a map.</p>



<p>These statements sparked a wave of comments from <span>livestream watchers who started asking for updates on the yet-to-be-announced&nbsp;<em><strong>The Witcher 3</strong></em>&nbsp;</span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">DLC</strong>. While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">UV o grach</strong> did not confirm or deny anything outright, he suggested that people are <strong>looking at the horizon while the answer is right under their nose</strong>, essentially doubling down on an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">earlier tidbit</strong> the former journalist dropped in early December about the new region being an extension of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> the Velen region</strong>, rather than a brand new one like the rumored <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zerrikania</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-zerrikanian-dream-truly-dead">Is The Zerrikanian Dream Truly Dead?</h2>



<p>Is this the <em>"You mistake the stars reflected in a pond for the night sky"</em> moment for the <em>The Witcher 3</em> community, like <strong>Vilgefortz</strong> accused <strong>Geralt</strong> in the novels? <strong>Hard to say without an official announcement.</strong> </p>



<p>However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">creating a new region from scratch</strong> would probably be too much effort for a smaller team working on an expansion launching this long after the base game mostly meant to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">bridge the gap</strong> with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 4's</em></strong> story, which, as far as we know, will be mainly set in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Kovir and Poviss</a></strong>. These two <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Northern Kingdoms</strong> on the Continent are even more far removed from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zerrikania</strong> than the general areas where the first three entries in the series are set. </p>



<p>As such, it's more sensible both for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">lore</strong> and for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">actual game development</strong> to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">expand what is already included</strong> in the game, rather than coming up with a brand new region which may never be visited again, no matter how unique or exotic it would be.</p>



<p>As this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">new</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 3</em></strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">DLC</strong> is reportedly <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">launching in May</strong></a>, it will likely not be much longer before we hear more about it, if it is indeed real. Hopefully, it will be an expansion worthy of one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">best open-world role-playing games</strong> ever made.</p>
