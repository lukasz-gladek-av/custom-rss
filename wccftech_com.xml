			<p>As promised, during today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a></strong> event, <strong>Playground Games</strong> showed off <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, giving us our first look at the latest entry in the series as it drives across the ocean to Japan. After its <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/">new island setting leaked</a>, so <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-leak-reveals-may-19-launch-date/">did its release date</a></strong>, which was <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">corroborated by the very reliable Dealabs</a> just hours ahead of today's show, and is confirmed to be <strong>May 19, 2026,</strong> for <strong>PC and Xbox Series X/S</strong>. As for <strong>PS5</strong> players, it's not launching day-and-date, but will arrive sometime "<em>later this year</em>," when the PS5 version is ready. </p>



<p>What didn't leak, thankfully for Xbox and Playground, was the gameplay showcase we got, which, you may not be surprised to learn, was incredibly impressive. The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 event was opened with Forza Horizon 6, with design director <strong>Torben Ellert</strong> diving into one of the game's key differences from Forza Horizon 5. Instead of starting the game as a superstar of the Horizon festival, you start as a nobody - a tourist in Japan that begins by entering the festival at the bottom tier, eventually working your way up to 'Superstar' status.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s a slightly different approach compared with previous Horizon games; in </em><em>Horizon 4</em>, you’re rising through the ranks in the UK, and in <em>Horizon 5’</em>s Mexico, you’re at the apex of the career you built in the epilogue of the previous game," an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/">Xbox Wire blog post reads</a>, regarding the shift in starting position. "<em></em><em>Horizon 6</em> almost feels like a fresh start, and one designed to appeal not just to car enthusiasts, but anyone with a big goal."</p>

<p>Playground describes Japan as the largest map ever in Forza Horizon history, with more verticality, and the largest urban district ever included in a Forza Horizon game. It's "<em>a world where every road leads to discovery</em>," Playground proclaims.</p>



<p>Beyond the map, the roster of cars available at launch is also the biggest roster included in a Forza Horizon game from day one, with <strong>550 cars included at launch</strong>. The roster has also been overhauled to include a better balance across the roster.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of updates to how you build out your garage and home, with a full mountain valley for you to populate with garages and buildings to show off to your friends. Your friends will also be able to help you populate that valley, as building is now an entirely multiplayer experience in Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>There are plenty of more features yet to be shown in Forza Horizon 6, but thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer, since we know we'll get the chance to play it ourselves on Xbox Series X/S and PC this coming <strong>May 19, 2026</strong>.</p>

			<p>Before <strong>Hytale</strong> became the standalone MMO we know it to be today, it began its life as a <strong>Minecraft </strong>mod called <strong>Hypixel</strong>. Since breaking off to become Hytale, with the studio behind it taking the name Hypixel, the MMO has been on a massive journey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">one that <strong>saw the studio get acquired</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">subsequently shut down</a></strong>, only <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/">to be revived again</a></strong>, and as of last week, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">off to a stellar start in early access</a></strong>. Now, the game's latest storybook moment in a long line of storybook moments brings it back to its origins, as some truly impressive modding work adds <strong>crossplay support between Hytale and Minecraft</strong>.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Two separate (though admittedly very similar) games, not the same game on different platforms, but two separate, standalone games, can support crossplay with one another thanks to the work of modder <strong>iamcxv7</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-and-minecraft-get-crossplay-capability-thanks-to-intrepid-modder">IGN</a>, modder iamcxv7 explains their work as just "<em>Packet Trickery,</em>" but that seems to be a humble cover for what is an amazingly impressive feat. Even though the mod itself isn't publicly available yet, and iamcxv7 admits that there's still a lot of work to be done, the fact that they've proven it to be possible is an incredible full-circle, storybook moment for both Hytale and Minecraft.</p>

<p>"<em>It's all just Packet Trickery</em>," explains iamcxv7. "<em>You could say I am running a Minecraft Server in the Hytale JVM which uses the Coordinate System of the Hytale World (As its the same) As well as takes a Snapshot of the Hytale World and reconstructs it and then send it to to the Client via Packets</em>."</p>

<p>It's a Hytale mod, so when it does go live, you won't need to add the mod to Minecraft to play with your friends on Hytale. You'll just add it to Hytale and play alongside your friends in Minecraft that way. It's all still early days for this mod as iamcxv7 admits that they only started working on it earlier this week, but even just as a proof of concept, this is an amazing effort.</p>
