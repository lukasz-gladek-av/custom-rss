<p>We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/">interviewed</a> Everstone Studio in September 2022, learning that there would be separate single player and multiplayer modes in Where Winds Meet. Indeed, now the developers have confirmed that there are some MMO-style features, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Build or join a Guild to unlock a wide range of group activities—from intense guild wars to challenging multiplayer dungeons and epic raids. </em></li>



<li><em>Prove your might in competitive duels, or step into a shared, ever-evolving world with thousands of fellow adventurers.</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-cancelled-developer-the-initiative-shut-down-as-part-of-microsoft%E2%80%99s-layoffs.1234302/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative">Windows Central</a>, which has been corroborated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsypjg3yg22e">Bloomberg</a>, the latest casualty from Microsoft's massive 9,000+ employee layoff today is Xbox Game Studios team The Initiative, a team that was founded for the purpose of making a new Perfect Dark game. That Perfect Dark game is now cancelled, and The Initiative has been shuttered.</p>



<p>Windows Central had previously hinted towards this while reporting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG had been cancelled</a>, but has now confirmed the news after obtaining an email from Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. Booty's memo also confirms what had already been reported around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild being cancelled</a>, and adds that "<em>several unannounced projects</em>" have also been cancelled as part of today's layoffs. </p>



<div><p>"<em>Following Phil's note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units</em>," Booty begins, referencing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">an email sent out from Microsoft Gaming chief executive officer, Phil Spencer</a>.</p><p>"<em>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment</em>. <em>Our portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</em></p><p><em>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams. To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead</em>."</p></div>



<p>The cancellation of Perfect Dark also brings an end to the partnership Xbox had with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-being-available-for-perfect-dark-was-too-precious-of-a-resource-to-pass-on-says-xgs-head/">Crystal Dynamics,</a> who was working on the project alongside The Initiative.</p>



<p>Players who grew up with the first Xbox consoles recognize Perfect Dark as one of the series that helped make the Xbox a household name. While the last official Perfect Dark outing failed to impress, the excitement around its reboot could not have been higher for fans. The Initiative was described as a team of industry veterans, all excited to bring back the beloved stealth series. We even got to see some fairly impressive gameplay last year, seemingly indicating that the game was progressing well and that we'd see it on shelves within the next two years.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Now, we'll never know what the final product would have looked like, as the failings of Microsoft's executive branch continue to devastate thousands of people across the video game industry.</p>



<p>While there have already been major cuts confirmed today, more are still inbound. Forza Motorsport studio, Turn10, has<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l"> reportedly lost 50% of its staff,</a> and several Call of Duty studios, including Raven Software, have also suffered layoffs as part of today's cuts. We'll continue to update our stories and report on the cuts as more details are confirmed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenimax-online%E2%80%99s-new-mmorpg-has-been-canceled-too-after-7-years-of-development.1234200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's pretty much confirmed now that even ZeniMax Online's second MMORPG has been canceled amidst Microsoft's massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">wrote</a> about it on BlueSky, adding that the project had the codename 'Blackbird'.</p>



<p>ZeniMax Online is the developer behind the highly successful MMORPG Elder Scrolls Online. While continuing to update that game (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-developer-qa-theres-tons-of-exciting-stuff-we-havent-talked-about-thats-coming-to-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> a major update), though, they had also been building a separate team to create a new project. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/">reported</a> on it in November 2022, when this team had already worked for four and a half years and had swelled to over 200 developers.</p>



<p>The Creative Director was Ben Jones, who once revealed a few very high-level details about the project:</p>



<p><em>This is a considerable investment and a very large scope project.</em> <em>We're creating a new IP, so a lot of that started with a background for a world, a vision for a high-level world that we were going to create, and to a degree, a story that we wanted to tell.</em> <em>The biggest beats of that existed before my time here. My job was to take those components and to really put flesh on the bone, to create a core team that understood what my bosses were seeking to create.</em></p>



<p><em>The first two hires that we had on the team were a Lead Writer and what we call a Loremaster, someone who is responsible for the core tenants of the IP and all of the mythology that goes into the game. We work together along with our core creative team to establish what those core tenants are. We iterated on that. Our main story has changed 10 times in the last four and a half years as we evolve what the product is.</em></p>



<p>Jones has now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346203934107103232/">posted</a> his first thoughts on LinkedIn, calling Project Blackbird the 'most exciting and ambitious' one he had worked on in his career. He is credited with having previously worked on Day of Defeat, Medal of Honor: Warfighter, several Battlefield 4 expansions, the space survival simulation game Into the Stars, and H1Z1: Just Survive.</p>



<p>Now, Windows Central has <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-cancellations-july-2025">added</a> a few tidbits on the developing story from their sources. The game would have been set in a fantasy world, they said, featuring dialogue branches not unlike Star Wars: The Old Republic or ZeniMax Online's own Elder Scrolls Online. The goal was to eventually make it the studio's primary focus as ESO wound down in time, but with its cancellation, the full attention of ZeniMax Online is undoubtedly back on that game.</p>



<p>Windows Central also says that Perfect Dark might be affected as well, although that's not yet confirmed.</p>
