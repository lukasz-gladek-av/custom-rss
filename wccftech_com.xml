This update will be adding a familiar face, as well as some new features and challenges for players to take on.</p>
<p>Last making an appearance in Monster Hunter Rise, the Bubble Fox Wyvern Mizutsune will be making a return and heading into the Forbidden Lands on April 4. Players will be able to unlock the mission by speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest once they are Hunter Rank 21.</p>

			<p>Several years after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-gets-delayed-to-november-30th-on-pc-a-bit-later-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original debut on PC</a>, Warhammer 40K Darktide continues to be updated with big patches. Today's free update is called Nightmares &amp; Visions and adds a new wave-based activity, significant enhancements to the Havoc end-game mode (including four new mutators), an overhaul of the Ogryn talent tree, a timed special event, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>New game activity - Mortis Trials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Wave-based feature:</strong> upon reaching level 13, players will be able to mash through waves of enemies in visions induced by the ship’s Psyker, Sefoni. Each time they venture into the Psyker’s visions, they will be able to build new and exciting playstyles by selecting randomized abilities and buffs for the duration of the trial.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Choose Your Indulgence, Shape Your Playstyle –</strong> Before the battle begins, players select an Indulgence, each offering unique buffs that enhance combat styles. Pyrokinetic and Voltaic focus on elemental damage, Fulminator blends both, Death Dealer excels in close-quarters ranged and melee combat, and Colossus boosts survivability.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Trials of Endurance –</strong> Mortis Trials unfold in 12 escalating waves, with every third wave introducing an objective to complete. Success grants supplies and stronger buffs, culminating in a final gauntlet where players unleash their full potential.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Uncover lore and backstories -</strong> By overcoming the Mortis Trials, players will unlock memory echoes, granting them access to secret information on some of the main characters present on the Mourningstar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Havoc mode gets a refresh -</strong> The end-game experience testing the resolve of the most seasoned operative reaches a new juncture with improvements and new daunting challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Improvements:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Havoc Assignment Rank Overhaul -</strong> Fatshark made progression clearer and more rewarding for all players. Now, everyone who participates in a mission will rank up if they meet the new progression criteria, making group play more fulfilling.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Introducing Campaigns to Havoc -</strong> To keep gameplay fresh, Warhammer 40K Darktide will introduce a rotation system for mission pools and mutators in Havoc challenges, ensuring variety across play sessions. With the Nightmares &amp; Visions update, players will have their ranks reset to the nearest threshold based on the highest rank reached since the introduction of Havoc last year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>New challenges -</strong> Fresh horrors are joining the fray with four new mutators added to Havoc:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Heinous Rituals -</strong> Heretics attempt to summon a new kind of Daemonhost, disrupt their rituals, or face the consequences.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>The Encroaching Garden -</strong> Specific enemies will heal their allies. If not promptly defeated, they will rapidly regenerate the ranks of the heretics.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Rampaging Enemies -</strong> Fallen enemies empower their allies with a surge of strength, making tactical planning crucial to avoid being overwhelmed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">

</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Time-Limited Special Event “A Day At The Theatre” -</strong> Following the release of Nightmares &amp; Visions, Warhammer 40K Darktide will be hosting a special event focusing on playing Mortis Trials, taking place in the theatre of the mind of the ship’s Psyker.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Ogryn Talent Tree Rework -</strong> The Ogryn class is getting a Talent Tree overhaul, providing players with increased build opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The Ogryn talent tree has been revamped to expand viable melee builds, introduce stronger tank and support options, and improve ranged combat effectiveness. Melee builds are no longer locked into heavy attacks, with new talents supporting both light and heavy strikes. Tank-focused players now have more tools to define their play style, while ranged builds benefit from a reworked Burst Limiter Override, allowing for stronger explosive and sustained fire builds.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The Ogryn's movement and survivability have also been improved. Dodge now staggers enemies, and new passives enhance damage resistance and coherency Toughness regeneration. Additional talents allow for hybrid play styles, rewarding players who mix melee and ranged combat. Overall, this rework aims to increase flexibility, making the Ogryn class feel more impactful and adaptable.</p>
