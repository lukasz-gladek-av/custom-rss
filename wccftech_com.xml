			<p>Build a Rocket Boy's debut title, MindsEye, is likely to finish 2025 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=15">as the worst-rated game this year</a> and one of the year's biggest flops. Prior to release, there was plenty of hype around it due to former Grand Theft Auto producer and Build a Rocket Boy founder, Leslie Benzies, leading the charge at the studio alongside Mark Gerhard. But even before the game was out, signs began to appear online that things weren't going well at Build a Rocket Boy.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">Negative early previews, combined with a launch trailer that failed to impress</a>, and a lack of information on the game so close to its release, gave players waiting to grab MindsEye misgivings about the game, to say the least. Then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two chief executives at Build a Rocket Boy left the studio</a> just two weeks before MindsEye's launch, which came shortly after <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game got out into the wild early</a>, and players had begun posting clips of the severe technical issues the game had and its lacking gameplay.</p>



<p>A statement from Build a Rocket Boy claiming a day one patch would solve these issues fell on deaf ears, especially since when that day one patch came, it didn't do what Build a Rocket Boy promised, and the game was still riddled with issues. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">studio released a statement committing to fixing it</a>, saying they were "<em>heartbroken</em>" over the state of the game's launch, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation had begun giving players who purchased the game refunds if they wanted one</a>.</p>



<p>Leslie Benzies <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/">pointed at internal and external saboteurs for the poor state of the game</a> (which he had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">already done when MindsEye was getting negative previews</a>), but <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">after mass layoffs were confirmed at the studio</a> and reports that the game's flop could push IO Interactive, the game's publisher and the first game published by the Hitman devs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">to abandon its publishing arm</a>, former and current Build a Rocket Boy developers have laid the blame for the studio's struggles where it arguably should fall: with its leaders.</p>



<p>The buck has to stop somewhere, usually with the people who have the letters 'CEO' in front of their name, and according to <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">93 former and current Build a Rocket Boy developers in an open letter</a>, that's exactly who is to blame.</p>



<p>"<em>Employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy (BARB), together with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB), are writing to address the longstanding disrespect and mistreatment of your staff</em>," the letter, which is titled 'Open Letter to the Executive Leadership at Build a Rocket Boy', begins.</p>



<p>"<em>For years, you have expected them to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside. We estimate a UK-majority of the 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods. These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.</em>"</p>



<p>The letter goes on to directly call out three key faults in leadership, including "<em>lack of transparency and communication,</em>" "<em>unbearable levels of overtime</em>," and "<em>disastrous handling of redundancies</em>," before continuing that these are just some of the more public faults.</p>



<p>"<em>Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BARB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead</em>."</p>



<p>The developers also name four demands they have of leadership:</p>



<ol>
<li>A public apology for this mistreatment of employees and proper compensation for laid-off employees</li>



<li>The option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work their notice period or take Payment in Lieu of Notice (PILON)</li>



<li>A concerted, meaningful, and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company, including the acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union</li>



<li>A commitment to use official external partners to action any future redundancies and prevent unfair treatment</li>
</ol>



<p>The developers close off the letter by saying, "<em>Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family.' But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?</em>"</p>



<p>Way before any of this happened, when Build a Rocket Boy was in its earliest days, Leslie Benzies and the studio's leadership <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-series-former-producers-build-a-rocket-boy-completes-110-million-series-d-fundraising/">secured $110 million in funding for the studio and its debut projects</a>. With Benzies name attached to the studio, and the promise of a new Grand Theft Auto-sized game, there was a lot of excitement around what Build a Rocket Boy could become.</p>



<p>Now, it seems like the only thing it'll become is another failed studio, unless something drastically changes. </p>

			<p>Glenn Israel has worked on the Halo franchise for 17 years, joining Bungie back in 2008 when the studio was known for Halo, and stayed with the series by following it to 343 Industries (now Halo Studios) where he has been since. He is no longer working on the series that he spent nearly two decades with, however, as he announced with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/">a statement on his LinkedIn</a> that he has left Halo Studios, though the statement leaves plenty of questions as to the circumstances under which he is leaving.</p>



<p>"<em>As of today and after seventeen long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe</em>," Israel wrote. "<em>There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year</em>. <em>In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I know that</em> <em>the state of our industry seems dire but never forget that you are free to choose. No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values - and no one can force you to. Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong. As always, I'll be here if you need to talk</em>."</p>



<p>As Israel mentions, he'll share more about the details of his departure at some point in 2026, but his statement also seems to suggest he's not leaving amicably.</p>



<p>It's no secret that 343 Industries/Halo Studios has had its struggles in the last few years, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-joe-staten-joins-netflix-343-creative-director-frank-oconnor-leaves/">key members of the team leaving</a> before Israel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">layoffs and allegations towards parent company Microsoft for the studio's internal issues</a>, and fans turning on the studio for decisions <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-halo-devs-blame-microsoft-343-industries/">like leaving behind couch co-op on Halo Infinite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-microsotrancation-plans-abandoned/">almost including microtransactions in the Master Chief Collection</a>.</p>



<p>The future of the series has been unclear amidst all of this, particularly since Halo Infinite <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-team-fell-short-on-post-launch-plan-retrenched-now-booty/">didn't exactly hit its mark at launch</a>. As far as what we know is next for the series, Halo Studios has committed to sharing more at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo World Championships taking place later this month on October 24</a>, which could also be where <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">a rumoured remake of Halo Combat Evolved is first revealed</a>.</p>



<p>Whenever Israel is able to share more about his departure, it'll be interesting to see what he touches on and how the changes to the studio and its struggles impacted his decision to leave Halo behind.</p>
