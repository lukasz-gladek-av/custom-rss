            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of a world tour leading up to the launch of their latest entry in the zombie survival/parkour action series, Techland recently invited Wccftech and a small number of other content creators and journalists out to California to go hands-on with the opening hours of Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While our earlier preview was focused on the protagonist Kyle Crane coming to terms with his newfound Beast powers, this session was more intimate, instead centered around the opening hours of the adventure in Castor Peaks (minus the introductory moments where Kyle breaks free from his decade-long captivity). You could consider these where Kyle Crane slowly gets his groove back, returning to the freerunning zombie slayer he once was.</p>



<p>Castor Peaks represents a much needed change in scenery from the concrete jungles of prior Dying Light games. While there are still scattered settlements with tightly clustered buildings to parkour across, much of the landscape is filled with nature and untouched areas free from human influence. Given Castor Peaks’ status as a nature conservation, this fits the setting and builds out the world into more of a playground where Kyle Crane can let his inner beast truly run wild.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Given that Dying Light: The Beast carries off a decade from the original Dying Light, there has clearly been the passage of time where the protagonist wasn’t working on his wallclimbing or hammer throwing. In proper open-world gameplay fashion, this leads the player into a series of tutorial segments meant to both onboard the player and return Kyle Crane back to fighting condition. This means the usual gamut of learning how to wield a melee weapon as well as where and how to climb around the environment. White paint splashed across ledges and open windows serve as pathways for the player to traverse and thankfully they blend well enough into the backdrop of Castor Peaks that one might not even notice they’re present unless actively looking for them.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast’s parkour system still takes some getting used to the intricate jankiness to truly appreciate. While it’s true that Kyle Crane can climb up and mantle over just about anything with a flat surface, some of the more puzzling sections can be an exercise in patience. Rather than moving and clamboring at the speed I’d want to move, sometimes I found myself needing to stop and look over at the ledge I wanted to mantle over to and wait for Kyle to stretch his arm out and indicate that he was locked onto the ledge and by jumping, he would automatically reach for it. There were a number of high stakes moments where the sense of urgency was pulled back by needing to wait for the precision to climb above. Given that Dying Light: The Beast is still an RPG at its core with a robust skill tree, I anticipate seeing some new abilities pop up that will mitigate my concerns with the traversal.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At the same time, combat is the other key pillar to what makes the Dying Light series. Played out entirely in first-person (minus the third-person cutscenes and menus), players will experience the visceral combat through the eyes of Kyle Crane. Whether wielding a one- or two-handed weapon or firearm, zombies are constantly on the move for the protagonist’s flesh and won’t stop until their head is knocked clean off. Dying Light: The Beast features an overhauled dismemberment system and there is a gratuitous amount of gore as Kyle swings away with any implement he can get his hands on. And yes, once again, weapon durability is a constant stuggle to maintain but now that Kyle Crane has been around an apocalypse or two before, he’s skilled enough to repair his weapons on the go with a fair bit of scrap metal and other materials he’s scavenged up. No more having to trade out broken pipes every 90 seconds just because you tried to take on an entire zombie horde instead of taking the high road to run away.</p>

<p>As this session of Dying Light: The Beast was focused on the early hours of Kyle Crane’s revenge story, many of the more interesting upgrades and Beast powers were locked away for players to rediscover. One thing’s for certain though: years of captivity have turned Kyle Crane into a raging beast.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will launch on August 22nd, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X and PC for $59.99/$69.99 or as a free standalone DLC for those who purchased the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VOID Interactive's Ready or Not has surpassed 1 million copies sold on consoles, just four days after its console launch, which brings the game's total sales past 10 million, after it hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/">9 million copies sold on PC earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>When we launched Ready or Not on PC, it took about 36 days to reach 1 million units sold. On console, it took about 3.6 days. I’m incredibly proud of the team and what we’ve accomplished together. It’s a huge moment — and one we don’t take for granted,</em>" said developer and publisher VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, in a press release. "<em>Game reviews are holding strong as we head into our first weekend, and the team is already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience. To our players, partners, and everyone who believed in the project — thank you.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ready or Not passes 1 million copies sold on consoles. Image credit: VOID Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>VOID Interactive's chief operating officer and creative director, Stirling Rank, added, "<em>The response from console players has completely blown us away. Going from the days of excitement from our Early Access trailer blowing up on PC to seeing the community grow globally so much across platforms &nbsp;is humbling, but &nbsp;testament to the incredible dedication of the entire VOID Interactive team to make this vision a reality for Ready or Not.</em>"</p>



<p>While the console launch has quickly been the next chapter of success in Ready or Not's story, it's also been another chapter marked with controversy. The console release came with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english">update and changes</a> that some players considered to be censorship, with certain aspects of gore, nudity, and violence changed in both the console and PC versions of the game. VOID Interactive maintains that the changes were "<em>to support stability and align with policies enforced by global platforms and age rating bodies."</em></p>



<p>VOID Interactive has always emphasized that Ready or Not is a "<em>hyper-realistic tactical FPS,"</em> and the changes ranging from victims in one level being nude, to now being partially clothed, to a child no longer appearing as having been dismembered post-mortem seem to clash with what players believed the original vision of the game to be. </p>



<p>While players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash">Steam have taken to review-bombing</a> the game to show their displeasure, it's clear that this uproar hasn't had an overtly negative impact on sales. If you're also dissatisfied with the changes, a player released a mod that reverts the changes to how the game was pre-console launch just <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ready-or-not-modder-retcons-censorship-changes-within-an-hour-of-new-patch-going-live">20 minutes after the update went live</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever.1248690/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot answered several questions during the company's General Meeting 2025 held earlier this month (a recording is available <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zzxygofu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, though you'll have to register first to access it).</p>



<p>The executive addressed hot topics related to Ubisoft, such as the commercial failure of Star Wars Outlaws, which he blamed largely on the IP's current woes:</p>



<p><em>For Star Wars Outlaws, we didn't reach our sales targets. The game suffered from a number of items. First, it suffered from the fact that it was released at a time when the brand - the brand that it belonged to - was in 'choppy waters'. And the game had a few items that still needed to be polished, and they were polished and debugged in the early weeks after release, but it did affect sales volumes. We did heavily improve the game after those early weeks, and when it will be released on upcoming consoles such as the Nintendo Switch 2, it will have a new version of the game.  </em></p>



<p>Guillemot refers to the fact that some Star Wars products that were released immediately before Star Wars Outlaws did not perform well. Chiefly, he might be referring to The Acolyte, which aired between June and July 2024 and was already canceled in August due to low viewership.</p>



<p>It's hard to imagine The Acolyte having such a big impact on Star Wars Outlaws sales, though. After all, other live action TV series like The Mandalorian, Andor, and Ahsoka had much better reception among fans. Much more accurate is the other half of Guillemot's statement, where the Ubisoft CEO admits that the game launched with several problems that were only ironed out over the course of the following months. Perhaps the game, in its current, improved state, will find a new audience on the Nintendo Switch 2, where it is scheduled to launch on September 4.</p>



<p>In the General Meeting 2025, the Ubisoft CEO also commented on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop Killing Games initiative</a>:</p>



<p><em>Regarding the petition, we operate in a market and whenever we release a game, we provide a lot of support for that game. We also provide a lot of services to make sure that the game is accessible and remains playable 24/7. So, we provide information regarding the game and how long the game can be played. Players and buyers are forewarned that the game may be discontinued. </em></p>



<p><em>[...] This kind of issue is not specific to Ubisoft. All video game publishers are faced with that issue. You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. We are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players, because obviously, support for old games cannot last forever. But that's an issue that we're working on, and it's something that the industry at large is working on to minimize impact on players. But clearly, it's something that you need to factor in. The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there is a service component, eventually the services may be discontinued because the software may become obsolete over time. </em></p>



<p>What do you think about the comments made by the Ubisoft CEO? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-open-beta-is-scheduled-to-go-live-in-early-august-expected-to-have-improvements-over-latest-battlefield-labs-build-%E2%80%93-rumor.1248688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 open beta may go live in around two weeks, judging from some recent discoveries shared online today.</p>



<p>As reported on the Battlefield series subreddit, members of the 1BF Telegram group discovered via the API of EA's backend services that the publication of the Battlefield 6 open beta build spotted earlier this month is scheduled for August 4. The open beta itself may not become available on the same day, but the fact that it is being published suggests that it should go live not too long after its publication. In addition, it has been discovered that this open beta build is five numbers ahead of the latest Battlefield Labs beta, meaning that it should sport plenty of improvements and possibly some new features not found in the latest testing build. The launch of the open beta will likely be preceded by the announcement of the game's release date and opening of pre-orders, as, according to another redditor, an <em>"early open beta access"</em> line has been discovered in the API, continuing the trend of pre-orders granting early access to beta tests.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 open beta becoming available in early August also falls in line with rumors of EA hosting a three-day event later this month for media and creators. The event is said to also feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-rumored-unveil-3-day-event/">live reveal</a> in the vein of the Battlefield 1 reveal, which also included live gameplay besides the official announcement. As such, it looks like it won't take long to finally see more of the next entry in the long-running series and how it will attempt to achieve its ambitious target of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">100 million players.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-will-run-pure-pool-pro-at-native-8k-resolution-60-fps.1248680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another game is soon joining the small lineup of PlayStation 5 Pro targeting native 8K resolution and 60 frames per second gameplay.</p>



<p>Pure Pool Pro, sequel to 2014's Pure Pool by Ripstone Games revealed today with a new trailer, will reportedly run at native 8K resolution and 60 frames per second on Sony's mid-generation refresh system, and at native 4K resolution and 120 frames per second on the base model. In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/ps5-pro-pockets-a-native-8k-60fps-game">Push Square</a>, Ripstone Games' George Holland provided some additional information on the matter, saying that the nature of the pool being fixed around the table, their relatively lightweight proprietary engine and their initial pre-alpha testing before any optimization led the team to believe that 8K@60 FPS on the PlayStation 5 Pro is achievable.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pure Pool Pro - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | New 8K Native Cue Sports Sim - Coming 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aXyjAT5pvs?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, Pure Pool Pro will be joining a small lineup of games targeting 8K resolution on the system. Among them are <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-gran-turismo-7-pssr-8k/">Gran Turismo 7</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/">No Man's Sky</a>, but neither of them can run at native 8K resolution on the system, instead taking advantage of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler to reconstruct a lower resolution, usually in the ballpark of 4K resolution, to 8K. Considering how 8K displays aren't widespread, not too many players are able to enjoy these few PlayStation 5 Pro games at 8K resolution, but having more options is never a bad thing.</p>



<p>Besides allowing developers to implement 8K modes in their games, the PlayStation 5 Pro has a lot to offer over the base model, as its higher specs than the base model can offer the same image quality seen in Quality display modes at 60 frames per second.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-nintendo-switch-2-fire-emblem-game-may-be-in-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1248666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new entry in the Fire Emblem series may be in the works for Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a recent online discovery.</p>



<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAPgmb2p7L8">Doctre81</a>, a veteran Japanese 3D character modeler who has worked with Square Enix, SEGA, and Cygames, among other publishers, revealed on LinkedIn that they have worked from January 2025 until April 2025 on the "sequel of Nintendo's SRPG (tactical role-playing game) on Switch 2". While the 3D character modeler hasn't mentioned the name of the game, or the series it belongs to, there's a very good chance this sequel is a new entry in the Fire Emblem series, as the other notable tactical role-playing series by the Japanese company, Advance Wars, hasn't seen a new entry in a very long time, and it may not be as popular nowadays as to warrant a sequel, considering how Advance Wars 1+2: Re‑Boot Camp did not set the sales charts on fire. The fact that the 3D character modeler only worked for a few months in the game may also suggest this isn't a new entry in the series, but possibly a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for one of the Fire Emblem games released on the original Switch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Is this sequel a new Fire Emblem game for Nintendo Switch 2?</figcaption></figure>



<p>It has been some time since we saw a new entry in the Fire Emblem series, so a new game launching on Nintendo Switch 2 would make many fans quite happy, especially those who didn't exactly like the latest entry in the franchise, Fire Emblem Engage. The game launched in 2023 features very solid gameplay, bringing back some classic mechanics, but its mixed bag of character designs, disappointing storyline, and trite social elements left something to be desired. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fire-emblem-engage/">review.</a></p>
