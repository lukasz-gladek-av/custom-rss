			<p>It's pretty safe to say that the video game industry has been in a weird place for several years now, but for <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, who has been at this for a long time, the state of the video game industry is in an unprecedentedly poor place. Founder of <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong> and creator of <strong>Just Cause</strong>, Sundberg is getting ready to release his next major game with his new studio he founded in 2020, <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, which'll release <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong> this coming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-release-date-liquid-swords/">April 8, 2026</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Ahead of Sundberg and Liquid Swords showing off their new title and announcing its release date during today's IGN Fan Fest, I got the chance to attend a presentation about Samson along with a few other members of the press, before spending some time playing the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale/">You can check out my impressions on all of that here.</a></p>



<p>Afterwards, I also got the chance to ask Sundberg and Liquid Swords' senior game designer and mission designer for Samson, <strong>Donald Young</strong>, a bunch of questions about the upcoming game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">Within that interview</a>, I also asked a more pointed question about the realities of the modern video game industry, and how Liquid Swords is set up for the long term. That's when Sundberg laid into his thoughts on the current market and how he sees things.</p>



<p>"<em>I’ve been making games for over three decades and&nbsp;<strong>never experienced such a desperate, cowardly (they call it 'risk averse') and confused state of the business</strong></em>," Sundberg said. "<em>After the acquisition / over-investing party during ‘21-’23, we are dealing with the hangover and it’s been going on for three years.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Sundberg continued by explaining how he has personally invested in the foundation of Liquid Swords, so not only does he have his personal finances at stake, but he also understands the more important factor is the future of the studio and its ability to keep a team of developers together.</p>



<p>He also cites <strong>NetEase</strong>, which invested in Liquid Swords in 2021, as a partner that has significantly helped Liquid Swords get to the point it's at now, where it is inching closer to releasing its debut game. But the studio isn't taking anything for granted, and is doing what it can to keep the lights on, which Sundberg admitted also included laying off <strong>half</strong> of the team at Liquid Swords to make sure they could get Samson out the door.</p>



<p>"<em>We have very careful cash-flow planning as we are on a limited budget. Last year, we made the tough decision to lay off (I don't call it 'restructuring' or any other BS term for what it actually is) <strong>half the team,</strong> to buy us a longer runway into 2026. We made a bet, and we do everything we can to deliver a fun $25 experience to lay the foundation for the future. I hope our future players will see the potential in our work and follow us on our journey to make something bigger</em>."</p>



<p>We can't know when the industry will get over the "<em>hangover</em>" it's been dealing with, which has resulted in countless <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">studio shutdowns and thousands of developers losing their jobs</a> over the last few years, but Sundberg is right on the money with how the industry is incredibly 'risk-averse' right now. One of the key takeaways from <a href="https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/">Matthew Ball's State of Video Gaming 2026 report was how private investment in the industry continues to decline.</a></p>



<p>Even though we're still getting some great games to play, the best gaming experiences always come from creators trying something new, and that means taking risks. Creatives understand how important it is to take risks. Hopefully, the bean counters of the industry will start to understand that more as well.</p>

			<p><strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong>, the debut project from <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, the team founded by <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong> (that's the <strong>Just Cause</strong> and <strong>Mad Max</strong> people, not the <strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong> studio <strong>Avalanche Software</strong>) founder, <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, finally has a release date. It'll arrive on PC first on <strong>April 8, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After being founded in 2020, the studio is now only weeks away from releasing its debut title, six years later. The game stars Samson McCray, a classic tough guy and driver who returns to his home town of Tyndalston with a heavy debt to pay on his shoulders. He'll have to take jobs each day to try and pay off that debt, while also trying to reluctantly make Tyndalston home again, not just for his own survival, but for his sister, who put everything on the line to make sure he got to keep breathing.</p>



<p>The game kicks off with Samson returning to the city after a job in St. Louis goes south, and as you'll see in the gameplay trailer below, he'll have to work off his debt by breaking plenty of skulls for anyone who'll pay him.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've spent a large part of my career building massive games,</em>" said Sundberg in a press release. "<em>With Samson, we knew that bigger doesn't always equal better and had to be extremely deliberate in what we built. Samson is the result of our team's work, tirelessly fine-tuning what our players expect, and more importantly, what makes games fun."</em></p>



<p><em>"<strong>It's not bloated, it's all about focus, and we keep players at the center of every decision</strong>. Fans of gritty 90's action flicks have something to look forward to when Samson releases on April 8th. Buckle up, because <strong>you're in for a ride</strong></em>."</p>



<p>For more on Samson, you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale/"> check out our hands-on preview with the game</a>, where I got to spend some time playing it after hearing directly from Sundberg and senior game designer <strong>Donald Young</strong>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">You can also check out my interview with them</a>, where they dug more into the kind of game they're building, while Sundberg also shares some of his thoughts on the video game industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>All the way back in 2020, <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, the founder of <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong>, established a new video game studio after taking some time off once he left Avalanche after it was acquired in 2018. That studio was (is) <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, a new studio that, six years since its founding, is inching towards releasing its debut project: <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong>.</p>



<p>Last week, ahead of Liquid Swords announcing Samson's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-release-date-liquid-swords/">April 8, 2026</a>,</strong> release date, I got to spend some time hearing from Sundberg and the development team about Samson before going hands-on with the game myself. I also got to ask Sundberg and mission designer <strong>Donald Young</strong> a bunch of questions I had about the game, and about Liquid Swords. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">You'll be able to read that interview here.</a></p>



<p>For now, I have a bunch of thoughts about what I played, which was a little more than an hour into the game and its first couple of story missions before the end of the preview session.</p>



<h2 id="h-samson-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale">Samson Hands-On Preview - "Intensity Over Scale"</h2>



<h3 id="h-samson-is-not-gta-and-it-s-not-aaa">"Samson is Not GTA, and It's Not AAA"</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_City_06-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The quote in the headline of this preview, "<em>Intensity over scale</em>," comes directly from Sundberg, who said it while he was delivering what he prefaced as a bit of a disclaimer. When Samson was first being showcased, even from its first in-game screenshots that the studio showed off, players immediately began comparing it to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/">Grand Theft Auto</a></strong>, a comparison that the studio had not made itself, according to Sundberg, nor was it one the studio wanted.</p>



<p>"<em>Since this has been a hot topic ever since we showed that 10-second video of the city, we have been constantly compared to GTA, and we have never compared ourselves to GTA. Never ever. <strong>Samson is not GTA, and it's not AAA.</strong> It's a focused, mid-budget game built for <strong>intensity over scale</strong>, and priced accordingly, and it's designed around tight systems instead of endless content sprawl. So our ambition is different, our scope is different.</em>"</p>



<p>It was a significant way to start the presentation, but while its intention was to try and get me and the rest of the attendees not to compare Samson to GTA, while I can't speak for everyone else who was there, it definitely made me do nothing but constantly think of GTA while I was playing Samson.</p>



<p>And I know I probably won't be alone in that. I mean, GTA is such a dominant force in the industry and is a franchise that hundreds of millions of players have deep memories and connections to. A game just has to be set in a big city where you play as a criminal who can drive around and steal other cars to be reminiscent of GTA for most people.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_10-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though, as you might expect, the creative director talking about the video game he is leading a team to build knows what the game they're making is and what it isn't. It's definitely not GTA, and for my money, it's all the better for it.</p>



<p>You'll step into the shoes of Samson McCray, the best getaway driver Tyndalston has ever seen, who took a job in St. Louis that he probably would have driven in the opposite direction of, if he knew it would end with him in prison, and while stuck there, his sister is forced to make a bad deal with worse people just to keep her brother breathing.</p>



<p>But Samson isn't prescient, so after the St. Louis job goes south, he winds up back in Tyndalston, appropriately in the city's South End district, and by the terms of the deal that was cut, he's got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/">massive debt he needs to work off</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_05-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That's the narrative establishment for the gameplay loop, which sees you get in your car (which Liquid Swords calls the <strong>'Magnum Opus</strong>'), and drive across Tyndalston to one of eight job types each day, trying to earn enough to pay your daily dues and keep debt collectors off your back. I got to experience a few different job types in the time I played, jumping between jobs that got me behind the wheel and ones that called for fisticuffs.</p>



<p>I much preferred how the brawling hand-to-hand combat felt over the driving missions, though I chalk some of that up to the technical issues I had. Myself and the rest of the press that attended this preview were playing an early build, with plenty of known bugs, and even though the release date isn't too far off, I'm not going to knock a version of the game people will (hopefully) never see on their devices. That said, I'll be looking forward to getting a better feel for the driving when the game is actually out.</p>



<p>Even with my issues, the missions I played did make me understand what Young and Sundberg are talking about when they say Samson is about "<em>Intensity over scale</em>."</p>



<h3 id="h-a-story-split-by-action-points">A Story Split by Action Points</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_CarBrawling_05-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Part of why I got that comes from Samson's visuals. It's a very good-looking game for such a grimy-looking city, and its action sequences have a great cinematic feel to them with the way the camera zooms in when Samson gets into a fight or how the action slows down when you take out another car in a huge crash.</p>



<p>Moving through all of your missions in a single in-game day will have you go back-to-back with those kinds of moments, which, as long as missions can keep an element of variety to them, probably won't get old very quickly. Or, at least, even if it does, as we learned from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-will-feature-elements-mad-max-just-cause-main-story-10-hours-bump-to-25/">FAQ that Liquid Swords put out in December 2025,</a> the main story should only take you about <strong>10 hours</strong> to finish up. You can more than double that game time with side content, but it can be a shorter, action-packed experience if you want it to be.</p>



<p>Especially with how the choices you make in each in-game day really dictate the kind of experience you get. Each day in Tyndalston is broken up into three sections: <strong>Noon, Evening, and Night</strong>. Each of those sections includes two <strong>Action Points</strong>, and accepting missions consumes Action Points. If each mission requires two APs, you'll do three missions that day.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_City_03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Every new day moves the story forward, and every choice you make - or don't make - impacts how South End sees your Samson McCray. The missions you'll see pop up on your map each day that'll pay enough to help you square away your debt seem to consistently consume two APs, but they're not the only source of missions in Tyndalston.</p>



<p>You'll also be able to find missions to go on throughout the city, just by paying attention to what's happening around you and what NPCs are saying. Liquid Swords calls it the game's "<em>Story Deck system</em>," which spawns small events across the city for you to happen upon.</p>



<p>Granted, this was not an element of Samson I got to play around with in this preview; I only had so much time to play the game, and I was trying to get a handle on the game's core content, so I really only played more campaign-focused missions. But what makes these 'story deck' missions intriguing is the possibility of where they'll take you. I stopped and listened to plenty of NPC chatter when moving from mission to mission, and I'm looking forward to pulling at those many threads in the full release.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_09-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In my interview with Young and Sundberg, Young used the example of Story Deck missions as to how your daily choices impact your experience. Stopping to help someone might mean you don't get the chance to take on a different mission that day, causing you to be short on your daily debt payment. But helping that person will have an impact on how the people of South End and Tyndalston see you, just like not making that choice will also have an impact.</p>



<p>Ultimately, we won't know how much of an impact those choices will really have until playing the full game, but the impression I got was that you can ignore those smaller events without little consequence beyond missing out on that section of the game. But again, that's only after spending a little more than an hour with the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-kiss-action">'KISS' Action</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_CarBrawling_07-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like some of the best action movies ever made, Samson <strong>doesn't try to fix what isn't broken</strong>. Its brawling hand-to-hand combat follows simple rules. You have a light and heavy punch, you can dodge, you can parry, but most importantly, you can smash up the environment around you with your enemies' faces.</p>



<p>Creatively using your environment to dispatch your foes one-by-one is something that will never get old for me, and it's an element of close-quarters combat design that is a true art when it's done well. Again, these are all just impressions based on a short time with it, but what I saw is that Liquid Swords is doing its best to put you in a variety of situations with more than just the same few set pieces around you repeated across the city.</p>



<p>It's car combat also follows a similar 'KISS' mantra, because when you're in the heat of a chase, landing a solid blow that sends the car you're chasing flying into the air off the curb is always cool. You do have to take proper care of your car; it won't repair itself after you toss it around trying to hit other cars. But how that impacts the game's pacing is another element I couldn't try due to my limited time with the game. Still, it's an interesting element to note that has plenty of potential for what it could add.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-bang-for-buck-approach-that-i-hope-pays-off">A Bang for Buck Approach That I Hope Pays Off</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_HandtoHandCombat_01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As Sundberg clearly stated, Samson: A Tyndalston Story isn't trying to be a big AAA game. It's a smaller scale, AA game, focused on deep exploration within a specific setting, intense vehicular and hand-to-hand combat, with a grounded and gritty story.</p>



<p>I'm not so sure it'll be able to execute on the story front. For what it's worth after playing so little of it, I'm not immediately impressed by any of the writing or performances so far. That could change of course, and I hope it does, because if Samson can deliver a story that's on par with the gameplay experiences it has on offer, this could easily be one of the best games in 2026.</p>



<p>Especially when you add that this game is only coming in at <strong>$25.</strong> Sundberg has been clear on his personal <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/2026279277214208501">X (formerly Twitter) account that he'd rather overdeliver at a lower price</a>, and it seems like he and the team at Liquid Swords are on the right path to achieve that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The beginning of a new calendar year in the video game industry has, unfortunately, once again been marked by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">mass layoffs</a></strong> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/"> <strong>studio shutdowns</strong></a>. And while last year was kicked off by a brand new free-to-play game <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">becoming a smash success,</a> this year is marked by the exact opposite. <strong>Highguard</strong>, the latest free-to-play game on the market from former <strong>Apex Legends</strong> developers at <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, is the first major misfire of 2026.</p>



<p>After it was debuted at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong>, a lot was said online about a game that no one had played, while Wildlight kept its head down, preparing for its impending launch on <strong>January 26, 2026</strong>. Then it arrived, and despite hitting <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/"><strong>97K concurrent players</strong> on Steam</a>, it couldn't keep those numbers. Players started <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">ripping the game apart in user reviews</a>, and just two weeks after launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">Wildlight laid off <strong>"<em>most</em></strong>" of the development team</a>.</p>



<p>One of those laid-off developers has <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/">given their version of events</a> as to how Highguard's failure transpired, but now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has provided a bit more insight into what happened with the studio after speaking to several of the former Wildlight Entertainment developers.</p>



<p>The short version of the answer, according to the developers Schreier spoke to, is that Highguard failed because of the "<em><strong>hubris</strong></em>" of its leadership team, who believed they could recreate the kind of instant success that Apex Legends had when it was shadow-dropped in 2019. That's also part of the long answer, but the long answer also includes a fairly big hole that was missed during the game's testing.</p>



<p>In the report, it's pointed out that Wildlight never properly addressed the fact that when they tested the game with external players and turned their microphones off, it created a drastically different experience compared to when players could vocally communicate with each other. There are a lot of systems to learn in Highguard, and without being able to talk it out with other players, the testing results were more negative than positive. It also didn't help that having members of the Wildlight team on hand to aid players who were confused about what to do didn't provide accurate playtesting conditions for their results.</p>



<p>Having a hole or two in its testing process ultimately wasn't the sole reason for Highguard's downfall, but it does feel like a significant component that explains a bit about why it launched as such a mish-mash of genres.</p>



<p>As for those remaining at Wildlight, the report confirms that there are "<em><strong>less than 20 people</strong></em>" left at the studio, trying to salvage the shooter. If it's able to pull off a comeback, it wouldn't be the first game to beat such high odds, and it's always better to see a studio beat the odds instead of succumbing to them. But laying all your hopes in slim chances like that is its own kind of hubris.</p>
