			<p><strong>Nintendo</strong> is due to have its third <strong>Nintendo Direct event</strong> of the year <strong>next week</strong> on <strong>Thursday, February 5, 2026</strong>, and it'll be a <strong>Partner Showcase Direct</strong>, if multiple reports surrounding this rumour are to be believed.</p>



<p>After first coming from known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c">NateTheHate</a> (who has also predicted that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/"><strong>PlayStation State of Play</strong> is on the horizon for <strong>February</strong></a>), their report about a coming Nintendo Direct was corroborated by <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">GameXplain</a>, who then added that it would be a Partner Showcase, which was corroborated by NateTheHate, and as of today, both rumours have been corroborated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a>.</p>



<p>Next Thursday is the predicted date, and if it is indeed a Partner Showcase, that means we can only expect to see <strong>third-party related</strong> announcements, which means we likely won't get any news at all regarding what Nintendo has coming. Instead, it'll be about what the rest of the industry is bringing to the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If this Direct event does happen next week, it'll already be the <strong>third</strong> Nintendo Direct event of 2026, after the year began with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-nintendo-direct-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</a></strong> that revealed a first proper look at <strong>Yoshi</strong> in the film, followed by a Direct event dedicated to <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a></strong>.</p>



<p>But if you're not looking forward to either the film or Tomodachi Life, then next week's rumoured Direct is likely the first one you might actually tune in for. We could get another look at Switch 2 exclusive titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">The Duskbloods</a></strong>, and upcoming Switch 2 ports like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-into-2026/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Borderlands 4</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">007: First Light</a></strong>. </p>



<p>This may even be the event where we finally see <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/"><strong>Call of Duty</strong> announced for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and those are just some guesses at some of the bigger announcements we could see. There are also scores of potential indie game reveals that could happen at this rumoured event.</p>



<p>But Nintendo has to confirm it's actually happening before we can really start to speculate at what will be there. The last Partner Showcase Nintendo hosted <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">was in <strong>July 2025</strong></a>, and it announced the event the day before it happened. If Nintendo sticks to that same strategy, then we should expect a reveal next <strong>Wednesday</strong>. </p>

			<p>Japanese game developer <strong>Comcept</strong>, known for the games <strong>Mighty No. 9</strong> and <strong>ReCore</strong>, has shut down, <a href="https://gamebiz-jp.translate.goog/news/420020?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Japanese website GameBiz</a>, which spotted a Notice of Dissolution in yesterday's Official Gazette. </p>



<p>The studio was founded by <strong>Keiji Inafune</strong>, a former <strong>CAPCOM</strong> producer who co-created series like <strong>Mega Man</strong>, <strong>Onimusha</strong>, and <strong>Dead Rising</strong>, in 2010. Aside from the small free-to-play mobile game The Island of Dr. Momo, Comcept's debut title was 2014's <strong>Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z</strong>, an action/adventure spin-off in the Ninja Gaiden series for which the studio worked alongside <strong>Spark Unlimited</strong> and <strong>Team Ninja</strong>. Inafune and his team also worked with <strong>Sony's Japan Studio</strong> on the design of the PlayStation Vita exclusive game <strong>Soul Sacrifice</strong>.</p>



<p>Their first brand new project was Mighty No. 9, which Inafune presented as a spiritual successor to Mega Man. The action platform game sought funding on Kickstarter, where it gathered $3.8 million in pledges. Comcept developed Mighty No. 9 with the help of <strong>Inti Creates</strong>, another studio composed of ex-CAPCOM employees. The game was eventually published in late June 2016 by <strong>Deep Silver</strong>, but it wasn't well received at all. On Wccftech, Mighty No. 9 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mighty-9-review-nostalgia-cynic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>was rated just 4 out of 10</strong> by Chris Wray</a>, who summarized his experience with the following words:</p>



<p><em>Mighty No. 9 was designed to be a spiritual successor to Mega Man. If any of that spirit was ever here, it's long since decayed. The game is incredibly frustrating, suffers from bad design choices throughout and offers only middling enjoyment.</em></p>



<p>In the same year, Comcept also released ReCore, which it created in collaboration with the Texan developer <strong>Armature Studio</strong>. This game was received a bit better than Mighty No. 9 (at the time, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/recore-review-eden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it earned an 8 out of 10 from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a></strong>), but it still wasn't enough to get publisher Microsoft Studios to give the green light for a sequel.</p>



<p>The following year, Comcept was acquired by <strong>Level-5</strong> and became a subsidiary, helping Level-5 develop games such as <strong>Yo-kai Watch Jam: Yo-kai Academy Y</strong>, <strong>Megaton Musashi</strong>, <strong>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</strong>, and <strong>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</strong>. Now, all its assets will be transferred to the main Level 5 studio.</p>
