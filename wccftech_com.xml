			<p>Almost five years after its debut on PlayStation 5, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</a></strong> is finally hitting other consoles next month with a release on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S, allowing more users to enjoy the first entry in the trilogy. Ahead of the new ports release, Square Enix has released a playable demo today, which also serves as yet another great showcase of what the Nintendo Switch 2 can do with dedicated optimization taking full advantage of the system's capabilities.</p>



<p>The demo allows players to experience the iconic bombing mission, accompanying Cloud Strife and Barret Wallace as they set out to destroy one of the Mako reactors powering the city of Midgar, ruled by the Shinra Electric Power Company. Any progress made in the demo on both <strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.xbox.com/it-IT/auth/msa?action=logIn&amp;returnUrl=%2Fit-IT%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-demo%2F9NFTWDJKGSBF&amp;prompt=none">Xbox Series X|S</a></strong> can be transferred to the full game when it launches next month, and all those importing a demo save file can claim the bonus items <em>"Revival Earrings"</em> and <em>"Survival Set"</em>.</p>

<p>With so many multiplatform games targeting both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there's little doubt that Microsoft's consoles should be able to handle Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade well. As such, there's obviously more curiosity surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 version, and the demo confirms that the new generation Nintendo console will deliver a more than playable experience, featuring great image quality that's almost on par with the PlayStation 5 release, judging from the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976008"><strong>first screenshots</strong></a> shared on <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976341">ResetERA</a></strong> by user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/often-ignored-bear.51892/"><strong>Often Ignored Bear</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With such outstanding image quality on display, the community consensus on this port is unanimous. "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Played through it just now in handheld. This looks nearly identical to how Intergrade looks on a base PS5 in Quality Mode. The hair has some dithering at times but looks fine overall. This is an INCREDIBLE port," </em>said ResetERA forums member <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148978135">Neiteio</a></strong>, echoing a widespread sentiment among fans.</p>



<p>The launch of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S will mark the beginning of a year very likely filled with Final Fantasy VII news. According to director Naoki Hamaguchi, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a name for the final entry in the trilogy will be decided before the end of the year</strong></a>, suggesting that the game's first reveal has a very high chance of happening in 2026. </p>

			<p>A few months ago, developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-20-million-players-dead-island-3-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of Dead Island 3 as they celebrated the second installment reaching 20 million players (including those who played through subscription services and even those who <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grabbed it for free from the Epic Games Store MEGA Sale</a> earlier this year).</p>



<p>Now, though, Internet spotter extraordinarie Timur222 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pucmqonvvkskre2rhfmckaob/post/3ma3mavhny225?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncovered</a> from Dambuster's financial statements that the UK studio is targeting Q1 or Q2 2028 as the launch window for Dead Island 3. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>Dambuster Studios is a AAA video game developer based in Nottingham which has 194 employees (as of March 2025). 93% are working in development and the remaining staff are studio management and administrative support. After the release of Dead Island 2 Ultimate Edition in October 2024, the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3. All developers are assigned to the project, and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete, all of Dambuster's QA team will also be assigned to Dead Island 3. Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace. The current predicted release window for the project is Q1/2 2028.</em></p>



<p>Dead Island 2 launched on April 21, 2023, which means that Dead Island 3 will be out in less than five years, provided there are no delays on the schedule.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 took a long time to be released. It was first in development by Yager, which showcased the game with a playable demo at Gamescom 2014. However, publisher Deep Silver was not satisfied with the developers' direction for the project and removed Yager from it. In March 2016, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Sumo Digital would make the game. Three and a half years later, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassigned</a> to Dambuster Studios, an internal Deep Silver studio.</p>



<p>With so many developer changes, there was widespread skepticism about the final game's quality, but Dambuster <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a fun experience</a> that resonated with fans, convincing Deep Silver to assign Dead Island 3 as the studio's next project.</p>
