			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-qa-torn-banner-talks-permadeath-roguelike-and-sandbox-ish-elements/">Torn Banner Studios</a>, the developer behind Chivalry 2, has just announced that the first Early Access update for No More Room in Hell 2 has been released. This update is called Reinforcement and is currently available for players to explore. No More Room in Hell 2 is an eight-player, co-op horror shooter that just launched into early access and is already doing pretty well for itself. The Reinforcement update adds a number of quality-of-life fixes, new weapons, a new ending scenario, and additional skills for players to utilize. A montage of some of the features has been created and uploaded to the YouTube channel for No More Room in Hell so you can see what to expect from this update.</p>

<p>As with any update, the Reinforcement update will also fix a number of bugs and provide a well-needed balance across all difficulties. This will mean that the harder difficulties will be more challenging and will be a lot harsher on the player than they previously were. Additionally, the UI and UX has been improved for easier viewing and navigation, as well as allowing players to remove HUD elements should they feel the need to.</p>
<p>In this update for No More Room in Hell 2, Zombies will now have more natural reactions to damage, as well as improved hit responses to make the combat a smoother experience. As stated above, a new alternate ending scenario has been added to the game. This ending scenario is specifically for the Power Plant map and helps provide more variety for those who have a lot of experience with the game thus far.</p>
<p>The Reinforcement update also adds new weapons for players to experiment with, including the M7A1 Assault Rifle and the M1911A1 Pistol. Alongside this, players will have access to new skills to play with, as well as character generator rules.</p>
<p>On the official X account for this game, they have shared their <a href="https://x.com/nmrih/status/1848433282918322431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access Roadmap</a>, which includes some of the features that have been added or updated in today's update. They still have a ton of plans for what will come next in the game, such as the infection system. There are also concept ideas that they are toying with, including new maps, weapon attachments, and alternative game modes for players to dive into.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/292000/view/4452465569899216931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full blog post here</a> to find out all of the little tweaks they've done in the Reinforcement update so you know what to expect when you next play No More Room in Hell 2.</p>

			<p>If you've been getting stuck into Bellwright, the title by <a href="https://wccftech.com/bellwright-launches-later-this-month-in-early-access-heres-a-lengthy-qa-with-the-devs/">Donkey Crew</a>, then you'd better prepare for the latest update to come to the game. The Villages 2.0 update has gone live today, adding a ton of new content and quality-of-life updates for the game. If you've been eyeing up this game, Bellwright will be discounted during the Steam Autumn Sale, which begins today. To celebrate the update, a new trailer has been released to showcase some of the changes and new features that have been added to the town-building survival RPG. During the Steam Autumn Sale, Bellwright will have a 10% discount, bringing the game's cost down to $26.99. This discount will be running from November 27 through December 4</p>

<p>One of the most significant changes in the Bellwright update is how you can interact with villages once you've liberated them. You are now given the ability to call militia from the village to your aid, which can prove to be beneficial if you are fighting against stronger enemies. In addition, villages now have a prosperity level, which affects the population, the strength of the militia, and the realm of possibilities for expanding it.</p>
<p>With this update, town customization has now been improved. You can now add buildable roads, which will help provide more realism to your settlement and help plan the layout of the village. There are also new decorations you can add to make your town stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>While these are the main key features, there is a lot of quality-of-life updates that are key to making a difference to Bellwright and making the experience more enjoyable. This includes the ability to set up structure settings before the construction is finished, as well as fast traveling with companions along the rivers using the River Dock structure.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1812450/view/4472732402493426308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full list of patch notes</a> is available to read on Steam, where you can find out more about the bandit migration system, as well as the tweaks made to the strategic overlay on the map. The patch notes are quite extensive, and you can tell that Donkey Crew has put a lot of work into the game.</p>

			<p>In an official PlayStation podcast interview, Shuhei Yoshida made the announcement that he will be leaving Sony Interactive Entertainment after working there for 31 years. His official leaving date is January 15, 2025. He has had some truly <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-games-becoming-live-service-games-would-be-boring-sonys-shuhei-yoshida-says/">iconic moments</a> throughout his time at PlayStation. From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUY6qXiLFXA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling asleep during a monologue from David Cage</a> in 2013 to the iconic video demonstrating how to share games on PS4 right after Microsoft's failed Xbox One announcement. Throughout the years, he's become a very well-known face at the company, and in 2019, he made the decision to encourage indie developers to publish their games for PlayStation. As a result of his major contributions to the gaming industry, he was awarded the BAFTA Games Fellowship in 2023.</p>
<p>In the official PlayStation Podcast interview, he explained his decision to leave the company and some of the best moments he's had while working there.</p>
<p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation. When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company's been doing great. I love PlayStation 5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time."</p>
<p>At the moment, Yoshida has said that he has no plans for what's next, but that he would like to stay in the industry to continue to help independent game developers. For now, though, he has been traveling a lot, meeting with developers, and attending game events. He's also been looking at new and upcoming games while making sure to post about games that he has enjoyed throughout the year.</p>
<p>Yoshida originally joined Ken Kutanagi's team in February 1993 when they were still developing the original PlayStation. The team consisted exclusively of engineers, and Yoshida joined as the first person who wasn't in a technical role. In this role, he was in charge of talking to publishers and developers in Japan to try and get them to create games on PlayStation.</p>
<p>If you want to hear everything that Shuhei Yoshida has to say about his 31 years at PlayStation, you can listen to the podcast on Apple or Spotify. Alternatively, you can read the transcript between Sid Shuman and Shuhei Yoshida on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation blog</a>.</p>
