			<p>Over 20 games are being removed from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-lost-48-of-player-count-in-july-2024/">PlayStation Plus Extra</a> and Premium games catalog, including some first-party PlayStation games that can only be played on PS5 through the PS Plus Classic's catalog.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/several-playstation-exclusives-are-leaving-ps-plus-on-playstation-5-soon/">VGC</a>, games like Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2, which are only playable on PS5 through the PS Plus Premium Classic catalog, will be exiting the service. Infamous Second Son is the other first-party title that will also be exiting the service.</p>
<p>The rest of the list includes big titles like Grand Theft Auto V and Batman: Arkham Knight, along with indie hits like Ghostrunner and Enter the Gungeon. The full list is below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>MotoGP 24</li>
<li>The Sims 4 Island Living</li>
<li>Resistance Fall of Man</li>
<li>Resistance 2</li>
<li>Walkabout Mini Golf</li>
<li>Synth Riders</li>
<li>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord - Frozen Empire</li>
<li>Before Your Eyes</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners - Retribution</li>
<li>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2</li>
<li>Stranded: Alien Dawn</li>
<li>The LEGO Movie 2 Video Game</li>
<li>Ghostrunner</li>
<li>Payday 2: Crimewave Edition</li>
<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</li>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet</li>
<li>Portal Knights</li>
<li>Enter the Gungeon</li>
<li>Batman Arkham Knight</li>
<li>Infamous Second Son</li>
</ul>
<p>Games are added and removed from subscription services like PS Plus all the time, but these removals especially sting as they recently follow the news of a price hike for all three tiers of PlayStation Plus in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">over 20 countries</a> around the world, including Canada, Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Colombia, and Chile, to name a few.</p>
<p>Removing games like the Resistance titles also feels especially egregious. The Resistance series is beloved by veteran PlayStation fans, many of whom feel like we should have had remasters of the whole series long ago. Short of having a working PS3 with copies of the games, once those games are removed from the service, there will be no legal way to play two games from a series that was once as important to PlayStation as Horizon or God of War is to them today.</p>
<p>If players can't access a full lineup of first-party games in these services, it won't be surprising when more players start to consider what they're actually paying for. Especially regarding the top level of PlayStation Plus's tiered service, since the classics library is what really separates PlayStation Plus Premium from the rest.</p>
