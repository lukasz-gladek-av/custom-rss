			<p>As of today, the co-op update for Forever Skies is officially out and will allow players to group up in teams of four to explore the vast world that the game has to offer. All PC players will be able to play together with the co-op update, where you can work together to gather supplies, fight for survival, and help build up a fully customizable airship to help each other survive on the toxic, post-apocalyptic Earth. For those interested in the game, Far From Home is offering a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> limited-time discount</a> on Forever Skies on Steam until January 2.</p>
<p>Of course, co-op is not the only thing that has been added to this game, as they have taken player feedback to heart and have reworked some of the key elements in the game, as well as added new content to keep it fresh and exciting for anyone who is joining the game in Early Access. As Early Access continues, new features will be added to the game. For the latest update, that, of course, includes co-op. Also, the gameplay loop has been overhauled in terms of survival, progression, and exploration, allowing players to get a fresh experience that doesn't cause them to feel too samey after playing the game for a while.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies | World Evolved &amp; Co-op Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHq8D-gxoWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To make that possible, they have made substantial world layout redesigns, including overhauled location designs. There will now also be dynamic random encounters to keep you on your toes, whether you're surviving by yourself or teaming up with friends. There are now new additional enemy threats as well that you will have to learn to fight off to keep yourself safe.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy easter eggs from other games, you'll be able to discover new artifacts that have themed items from Planet Crafter, Pacific Drive, Frostpunk 2, and Medieval Dynasty as a fun little addition to the game.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't all that has been added to the game, as there are also new tools and devices that the players can research and build for themselves, which will allow new ways to progress through the game. This includes new resources that you'll be able to utilize in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>"Launching co-op mode is a huge milestone for us. Forever Skies was built with an emphasis on immersion and exploration, and we believe that experiencing this world with friends adds a new layer of excitement and depth," says Andrzej Blumenfeld, Creative Director at Far From Home.</p>
<p>Forever Skies is currently available on PC, with a single-player demo available to play now on PlayStation 5. Forever Skies is s<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/">et to launch from Early Access in early 2025</a> on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Randy Pitchford's social tease that the Borderlands 4 reveal would be coming soon, the official franchise page on X has now <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1866166006353449188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1866166006353449188%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game will be shown at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2024 show. The tweet also boasts how it will be the franchise's most ambitious installment to date.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom this year for a generic 2025 release window. Other than the confirmation that it will take place on a brand new planet, not much has been shared so far. The studio did provide fans with a few concept art <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-concept-art-revealed-at-pax-west-202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during a panel at PAX West 2024</a>, but those were mere tidbits.</p>
<p>The series certainly needs a bit of pick-me-up following the disastrous launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live action adaptation.</a> Despite the presence of actors like Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Édgar Ramírez, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart, the film was a massive box office bomb (making only about a quarter of its $120 million budget back), receiving equally devastating reviews from critics and fans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the previous game in the series sold extremely well, surpassing 18 million units last year. Undoubtedly, Gearbox owner Take Two (following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-buys-gearbox-for-460-million-confirms-new-borderlands-game-among-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$460 million acquisition from Embracer Group</a>) will try to match or even exceed those financial results with Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It seems like they're going all-in with The Game Awards 2024, anyway, as another heavy hitter of their 2025 lineup <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will also show a new trailer at the show. We're referring to Mafia: The Old Country, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. Developed by Hangar 13, it will function as a prequel, delving into the origins of the Mafia in the fictional Sicilian city of San Celeste.</p>
<p>Those rumors about a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2024-will-have-big-news-says-vgcs-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big The Game Awards 2024 show</a> are taking shape. As a reminder, the show will go live on Thursday, December 12, at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>
