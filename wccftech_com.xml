			<p>A Dark Souls 3 official remaster isn't getting developed anytime soon, but from today, PC players can enjoy playing the third entry in the series by FromSoftware with some amazing visual improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster.</p>
<p>The Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1849?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, has been developed by fromsoftserve, the same modder behind the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, and packs many of the same visual improvements, which include modified reflectance maps to fix an overly metallic look, improved SSAO, improved pointlights, dynamic shadows, removed hero lights from the player and enemies, introduces TAA via Reshade while disabling in-game AA and more. Also, these improvements are only the beginning, as the modder has plans to upscale all textures and add parallax occlusion mapping to more surfaces in the future.</p>

			<p>Sony angered a lot of PC gamers when it demanded that players register for a PlayStation account in order to play some of their ports, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-will-soon-require-a-psn-account-even-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarok</a>, just to name a few. It wasn't just a matter of not wanting to create another account beyond those required to actually purchase the game on Steam or the Epic Games Store; there's also the simple fact that some countries aren't even supported by PlayStation Network accounts, which made those games impossible to get there.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it appears that Sony has finally heard all the negative feedback on the subject. Four big single player games, two already released, one just released, and another due soon, won't require a PSN account on PC anymore. Instead, Sony is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implementing</a> some exclusive bonuses for those who choose to connect their PSN accounts anyway.</p>

<p>As a reminder, The Last of Us Part II Remastered is slated to launch for PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on April 3</a>, just a few days ahead of the debut of the second HBO season that will narrate the same storyline on the small screen.</p>
<p>However, it remains to be seen whether the new policy will also apply to <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, the indie action game published by PlayStation and scheduled to launch later this year on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
