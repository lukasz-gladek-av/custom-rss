			<p>On the onset of this year's edition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CES</strong>, NVIDIA took advantage of one of the key tech shows of the year to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">introduce NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a> which, in its early iteration, left pretty much everyone <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stunned</strong>, delivering in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/"><strong>Quality mode better than native resolution quality in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/this-really-puts-a-nail-in-amd-fsr-redstones-coffin-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nvidia-dlss-4-5-performance-mode-stuns-with-image-quality-close-to-native-4k/"><strong> close to native resolution image quality in Performance mode in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></strong></a></p>



<p>The impressive image quality, however, comes at a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">performance cost</strong> on previous-generation <strong>RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs</strong>, as older-generation cards lack <strong>FP8 support</strong>, which NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 leverages to deliver its stunning results. However, the performance hit may not be as severe as expected on some older GPUs, such as the RTX 3080.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmark PC</strong></a> compares <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em> running at 4K, 1440p, and 1090p resolutions at Ultra Settings and with ray tracing with Ultra Performance mode at 4K resolution, Balanced mode at 1440p resolution, and Quality mode at 1080p resolution using the following presets:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DLSS 3 - Preset E</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4 - Preset K</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4.5 - Preset L for Ultra Performance and Preset M for everything else</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The results are, as YouTube user darknuance_ix put it, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"not bad at all."</em> While the <strong>performance hit is noticeable</strong>, it's, on average, <strong>lower than expected</strong> - in the <strong>8, 12 FPS range at all resolutions</strong> from NVIDIA DLSS 3 to DLSS 4.5. </p>



<p>As such, the latest version of the upscaler powered by the 2nd-generation Transformer model may still be a viable option for those still rocking RTX 20 and 30 series cards, who also have the option of setting a lower base resolution and still enjoy excellent image quality to offset the performance loss, although how effective this will be will obviously vary depending on the game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gryphline-announces-arknights-endfield-pc-beta-test-system-requirements-revealed/">After multiple beta tests</a>, publisher <strong>Gryphline</strong> and developer <strong>Mountain Contour's</strong> action RPG and factory management game, <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, is finally due to launch globally next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> and over <strong>35 million players are pre-registered</strong> and ready for its arrival.</p>



<p>The news came along with a new launch trailer that you can see below, which, based on its comments, is more than successful at getting players hyped up for next week's launch. While the release date was initially revealed at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a></strong> with a live performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xm45NwWOlo">from <strong>One Republic</strong> performing the song featured in the trailer below,</a> at the time of that performance, the game only had 30 million players pre-registered.</p>



<p>This means the game received another <strong>5 million</strong> pre-registrations over the holiday period, which also unlocked the final tier of community rewards for players, <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us#milestone">per the game's official website</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the hype trailer above, Gryphline and Mountain Contour also released two more trailers. An Operator story trailer titled "<em>The Five: Sparks that Shatter the Darkness</em>," and a gameplay trailer that shows off a bit of the action and environments players can expect when they jump into the free-to-play action RPG next week. Here's the story trailer:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After Arknights: Endfield's last beta test, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto not only got a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming action RPG, but he also got to speak with the game's lead designer and producer. In his preview, Kai wrote, "<em>Being an entirely new genre and set in the far future from the original game, Arknights: Endfield aims to be something that can draw brand new players in that might have otherwise overlooked the original tower defense game. The gacha action RPG genre has become competitive in recent years, but Endfield’s AAA presentation and emphasis on base building might do well to set it apart from the competition</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Julian Gerighty</strong>, series producer on <strong>The Division</strong> at <strong>Ubisoft</strong> and <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong>, has left the French company to join <strong>EA </strong>and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, Massive <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">announced this morning</a>. Despite the fact that Gerighty's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">return to The Division and his appointment as the series lead were supposed to be votes of confidence in Ubisoft's favour for <strong>The Division 3</strong></a>, now that he's leaving, Ubisoft doesn't want The Division players to be concerned.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">short post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Ubisoft Massive account, which says of Gerighty, "<em>Once an Agent, always an Agent.</em>" </p>



<p>"<em>Today, we want to share that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on the Tom Clancy's The Division franchise is heading off to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios</em>," the statement reads. "<em>While we'll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we'll continue to bring the world he's been part of creating to our players for years to come</em>."</p>



<p>After thanking Gerighty, the post continues by addressing players, saying, "<em><strong>For our players, don't worry, Agents.</strong> Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For Gerighty's part, on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, he wrote, "<em>It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. Long live The Division and Godspeed!</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Agents! <br>Quick update from the Base Of Operations:<br>It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure.</p><p>The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on.</p><p>Long live The Division…</p></div>— Julian Gerighty (@jgerighty) <a href="https://twitter.com/jgerighty/status/2012156450039033939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The messages from Massive and from Gerighty are meant to try and calm any concerns players might have about his departure, but it's doubtful they've succeeded. Several of the comments under Massive's announcement are players sharing concerns for the future of The Division franchise and, most importantly, The Division 3, and you can't exactly blame them.</p>



<p>Not only does this news come days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/"><strong>Ubisoft laid off 55 developers</strong> from Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm</a>, but it also arrives at a time when, for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">all the recent talk about The Division 3 (talk that was coming from Gerighty)</a>, we've still not seen anything from the game as we come up on three years since its official announcement.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2 will be seven years old</a> this coming <strong>March 12, 2026</strong>, and players have wanted nothing more than a proper sequel for at least the last four years, and outside of The Division, Ubisoft doesn't exactly seem to be in a particularly strong place.</p>



<p>The company is currently embroiled in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">a battle with the <strong>CWA Canada</strong> after suddenly shuttering the <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> studio, three weeks after the majority of the branch voted to unionize</a>. It also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">recently laid off staff at its <strong>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</strong> team</a>, and the company is still seemingly in the midst of a restructuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">following the establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Gerighty's departure is also the second time in the span of a year that the series lead for one of the company's major franchises left shortly after layoff announcements, the first having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <strong>Marc-Alexis Côté</strong>, leaving amidst layoffs and restructuring due to Vantage Studios being established</a>. A departure that was also marked by Ubisoft seemingly trying to spin it as Côté choosing to leave, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">when in actuality, Ubisoft asked him to "<em>step aside</em>."</a> </p>



<p>When you look at the broader picture of the current state of Ubisoft, if you're a fan of The Division, it's pretty impossible for you not to be concerned about where the franchise will go from here. Yes, Gerighty is just one person, and it's not as if his sole contributions to the franchise were what made it the third-person shooter you love, but you have to wonder what it says about the state of a company when it has lost yet another veteran developer in a lead role on one of its major franchises.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/first-two-styx-games-are-free-on-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>1408267</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This week, the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> is giving away two games in the same franchise: <strong>Styx</strong>. Both the first entry, 2014's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/styx-master-of-shadows-4d9ab3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Master of Shadows</a>, and the more recent installment, 2017's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/styx-shards-of-darkness-77c030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shards of Darkness</a>, can be permanently added to your library on PC, provided that you do so before Thursday, January 22, at 5 PM. Shards of Darkness is actually being gifted with the Deluxe Edition, too.</p>



<p>Obviously, it's a way for publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Cyanide Studio</strong> to increase exposure to the stealth game series in advance of the new game, <strong>Blades of Greed</strong>, which will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>. You can now play the two entries of the sneaky goblin's adventures before checking out the limited-time demo that <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-demo-out-now-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released on Steam earlier this week</a>. The Styx games aren't masterpieces, but they're still pretty fun, and it's not like there's a ton of new stealth games on the market anyway.</p>



<p>The upcoming Blades of Greed will offer even more options for approaching stealthy missions. In Wccftech's hands-on preview, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Taking advantage of the map's verticality, I climbed the tavern from the outside, making sure to crouch under windows to avoid enemies spotting me. This approach provided not only a different experience but also highlighted how the sandbox design of Styx: Blades of Greed will allow players to complete missions in any way they like.</em></p>



<p><em>The second part of the mission, which involved taking down all enemies in a somewhat closed-off location with an intricate design with multiple passages between rooms, likewise showed how many options are at Styx's disposal to take enemies out, even without using any of the special abilities that can be learned via the different skill trees or new tools like the grappling hook and the glider. One option I didn't see back in the Gamescom 2025 build is the ability to poison food, which highlights once more how varied the player's approach can be to clear missions.</em></p>



<p>Stay tuned for our full review of Blades of Greed.</p>
