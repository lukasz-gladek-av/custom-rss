			<p>A new look at the yet-to-be-officially revealed Nintendo Switch 2 has come today, thanks to the renders put together by a well-known tech leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OnLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnLeaks</a>, who has previously put together accurate renders for tech products before their official reveal, created these new renders on behalf of <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">91mobiles</a> which are based on new data, including the supposed dimensions of the real console. A 360-degree video, which can be watched below, provides another great look at the system, the U-shaped kickstand, and the Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 | First Look | 360 Degree Video | Exclusive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KAbXItlrUnQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides the new look at the console's design provided by OnLeaks' renders and 360-degree video, today we have learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 may indeed use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/">microSD Express format</a> as <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-storage-samsung-sd-express-micrso-sd-cards-800-mb-s/">previously rumored</a>. This new standard can reach a sequential read speed of up to 800MB/s, four times faster than traditional UHS-1 memory cards, whose read speed is capped at 200 MB/s. The console adopting this new standard is hardly surprising, considering how multiplatform games are nowadays developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S SSDs.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but with leaks coming in daily, there's no doubt that the reveal is imminent. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds footage was shared online, providing a new look at the upcoming entry in the series, which will launch next month on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new 4K resolution footage, which was shared online by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, focuses on Ajarakan and Rompopolo, which will be found in the Oilwell Basin, an area that was previously announced but that was never shown in any previous footage. Besides highlighting how these two monsters will challenge players, the new footage also shows considerably improved performance over the open beta conducted last October, although it hasn't been specified which version of the game was used to capture the footage.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Ajarakan Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX0wxnX6WDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Rompopolo Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yp-28fhhOs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the performance improvements showcased in the new Monster Hunter Wilds footage will not be present in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-a-second-open-beta-test-soon/"> second open beta</a>, which will be held in two rounds in the first two weeks of February. This new testing version will essentially be identical to the first one, with the addition of some content, such as the returning monster Gypceros.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th. You can learn more about one of the most promising games launching this year in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom 2024 hands-on preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't revolutionize the series' formula in any way, it competently continues to smooth out some of the formula's rough edges to present a more engaging experience. This little taste of the experience left me hungering for more, and I really cannot wait to see what surprises the game has in store for hunters when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S next year.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format.1077828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the daily Nintendo Switch 2 rumor mill is focused on a screenshot reportedly grabbed by a GameStop employee from the internal list of upcoming product releases. The screen grab, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a few hours ago on the Switch subreddit, shows a JoyCon Charger Grip for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The most interesting tidbit is, however, the confirmation that the new console will use Samsung's microSD Express format. As you can see in the screenshot, the internal SKU list shows Switch 2 microSD cards of 256GB and 512GB cuts, priced at $49.99 and $84.99, respectively.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">Switch 2 SKU’s found in system today!!</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Opposite-Chemistry96/">u/Opposite-Chemistry96</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/">Switch</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We first&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-storage-samsung-sd-express-micrso-sd-cards-800-mb-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in February 2024</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 might use the microSD Express format. Back then, Samsung boasted that this was an industry-first product whose development resulted from</span> a collaboration with a mysterious 'customer' to create a custom product. That product might very well be the Nintendo Switch 2 game cards.</p>
<p>Hangu Sohn, Vice President of the Memory Brand Product Biz Team at Samsung Electronics, said at the time:</p>
<p><em>With our two new microSD cards, Samsung has provided effective solutions to address the growing demands of mobile computing and on-device AI. Despite their tiny size, these memory cards deliver powerful SSD-like performance and capacity to help users get more out of demanding modern and future applications.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Samsung's microSD Express cards can reach a sequential read speed of up to 800MB/s, or 1.4 times faster than SATA SSDs (which can reach up to 560 MB/s) and more than four times faster compared to traditional UHS-1 memory cards (capped at 200 MB/s).</p>
<p>Nowadays, games require an SSD, whether on consoles or PCs, due to the high data streaming needs of large virtual worlds. While the Nintendo Switch 2 won't focus on high-end technical advancements, it couldn't be left behind if it wanted to get as many ports as possible from third-party developers.</p>
<p>It's another small piece in the Switch 2 puzzle. Nintendo is still holding off on the official reveal, but they promised it will happen within this quarter.</p>

			<p>Shadow of the Colossus is a name we haven't heard in a long time. The PlayStation 2 action/adventure masterpiece originally developed by Team Ico was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-colossus-a-classic-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remade for the PlayStation 4 in 2018 by Bluepoint</a>, but beyond that, the PlayStation IP has lied dormant. Team Ico is no more; Lead Game Designer Fumito Ueda left after The Last Guardian to found genDESIGN, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased their new project</a> at The Game Awards 2024.</p>
<p>Not many of you may remember that a film adaptation was announced all the way back in April 2009 by Sony Pictures. In 2012, news broke that Josh Trank would direct the movie, but that changed in September 2014, when it was shared that 'Mom' director Andrés Muschietti would direct the film instead.</p>
<p>For over ten years, there's been no news at all, leading many to assume the Shadow of the Colossus adaptation was essentially dead. However, Muschietti has finally provided an update in an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tugk5mzMHqM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Argentinian YouTube Channel Radio TU</a>.</p>
<p>The director, who has since released the acclaimed horror movies It/It Chapter Two and the way less successful The Flash, said he loves the franchise and is still working on the project. Muschetti also confirmed there's a script he likes and did not hide the reality that the budget still needs to be secured. He'd like to get a big budget to make the Shadow of the Colossus movie as immersive as possible, but a film production studio needs to be convinced first. Here's the full translated quote:</p>
<p><em>Well, Shadow of the Colossus is a game that I absolutely loved when it came out, and I played it several times. Plus, it's one of those things that I keep going back to. I'm not really a big gamer, especially since I started working, you know? The free time you have shrinks, so there have been only a few games that I've really gotten into since then.</em></p>
<p><em>I started making movies, but Shadow of the Colossus feels like a masterpiece. It's a project we've been developing for over 10 years. After 'Mom,' I kept busy too, you know? It wasn't a film that came out right away because of everything going on in Hollywood. Basically, you start developing a project, and for some reason, it gets delayed, or something pops up in the middle. It's like juggling plates to stay afloat in that industry; you have to keep a few spinning at once.</em></p>
<p><em>People don't really see it that way because they get hooked right away when they hear it. They think, "Oh, it's coming soon!" But actually, going public with a story like this has more to do with the whole vibe around the movie's release than with the actual chance of it getting made. So yeah, it's in development, and in the meantime, I did some stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>It's a project that's been in the works for years, and now there's finally a chance to make it happen. It's still in development, but I really love this movie. There's a script I really like, and we'll see if it ends up being the next project. It's definitely not abandoned; it's still alive and kicking. Plus, you have to keep things in perspective, you know? The realism of a project really depends on how much money a studio can give me to make this movie. Unfortunately, there are factors that aren’t about your passion or desire to make it; it’s about how many people are going to watch this film and how popular a property like this is today. </em></p>
<p><em>Sure, Shadow of the Colossus is definitely a cult classic, but to make a good movie, there’s a studio that looks at the numbers and says... Well, how much interest is there in making a movie like this to give the director 200 million dollars or 150 or 100? There are different versions of this film. Personally, I want 200; I'll make it right! But that's just one of the factors to consider, and it's something that keeps fluctuating and being tested. It's still in development, and I'd love to work on it.</em></p>
<p>As we've been covering, gaming IPs are a prime target for both movie and TV adaptations. Sony itself, owner of the Shadow of the Colossus franchise, is leading the charge; earlier this week, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-to-adapt-horizon-and-helldivers-to-film-the-last-of-us-tv-season-2-launches-in-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two new films based on Horizon and Helldivers. However, those are hot intellectual properties that have just received new games; the world crafted by Team Ico, on the other hand, hasn't had a new installment since twenty years ago. As such, Sony might not be willing to bet big on it, which is why Muschietti is still having challenges with securing the budget for his vision.</p>
<p>We'll definitely keep an eye on any potential updates on the project, though. Stay tuned.</p>
