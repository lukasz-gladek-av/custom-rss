			<p>The new year has just begun, and unfortunately, there has already been some bad news. Splash Damage has <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a> that they have made the decision to end development on Transformers: Reactivate. Along with this means that there will also be a number of staff being made redundant, as they are reshuffling their studio and refocusing on other projects within the studio. Transformers: Reactivate was <a href="https://wccftech.com/transformers-mmo-by-certain-affinity-moved-to-splash-damage-report/">first announced in December 2022</a>, with minimal news coming out about it after the initial announcement.</p>
<p>The title was set to be a 1-4 player online action game that would be on PC and consoles, where you would have to reassemble the Autobots that were left in pieces in the debris. It was created in collaboration with Hasbro, Inc. The cinematic trailer for this title seemed promising, and had a lot of Transformers fans excited. Splash Damage is the studio behind Dirty Bomb, Gears Tactics, and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.</p>
<p>The full announcement from Splash Damage reads as the following:</p>
<p><i>Today, we have some very difficult news to share, the decision has been made to end the development of Transformers: Reactivate.</i></p>
<p><em>This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy.</em></p>
<p><em>This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people. We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on Transformers for their dedication and passion.</em></p>
<p><em>Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.</em></p>
<p><em>While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your compassion and understanding.</em></p>
<p>While they will no longer be working on this title, they announced in March 2023 that they are creating a new project called "Project Astrid" alongside streamers Shroud and Sacriel. The game is set to be an open-world survival game. Hopefully, those who were working on Transformers: Reactivate will be given the option to stay at the company, working on Project Astrid.</p>

			<p>Smite 2 has been in Alpha for a little while now, with new Gods being added pretty consistently to the game. At the moment, there are only two modes available, with players having the choice between playing Arena or Conquest. However, the MOBA is now set to enter Open Beta, allowing any who are interested to start playing it as of January 14. So, for those interested, you won't have long to wait.&nbsp; The game has been progressing at a steady rate, with most of the team at Hi-Rez swapping working on Smite to Smite 2. For those who haven't had access to Smite 2, there was a confirmed skeleton crew to be working on Smite just for small updates.</p>
<p>However, as they rearranged the team working on Smite, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/">led to layoffs</a> at the company that was not disclosed in the statement that Stewart Chisam wrote, but that the changes were "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was originally released in 2014, with its successor announced 12 months ago. This came after Hi-Rez celebrated 10 years of Smite, and now they are working on a new and improved that comes with multiple new Gods and plans to keep the game in action late into the 2030s.</p>
<p>At the moment, those who have wanted to play Smite 2 will have had to get a key for the Alpha via Smite 2 streams or purchase <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Founder's Pack on Steam</a>, which would give them extra bonuses in addition to access to the game as it develops.</p>
<p>With the release of the Free to Play Open Beta, it means that all of the pre-existing players and those who are just joining will get access to a ton of new content that will become available during this period specifically.</p>
<p>This includes five new Gods that will be added to the game, including Aladdin. Along with the variety of Gods in the game, there will also be three new game modes to jump into. These are Joust, Duel, and Assault, offering plenty of options for players who don't get on with the Conquest and Arena game modes that were already in the game. You can check out the Aladdin gameplay in the video below.</p>

<p>Will you be picking up Smite 2 in the Open Beta? If so, what Gods do you plan on playing?</p>
