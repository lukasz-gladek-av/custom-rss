			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 set in the Ultra Quality mode via the NVIDIA App can deliver better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality, as highlighted by a new comparison video.</p>
<p>The comparison video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, STALKER 2 and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running at 1440p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS 4 in DLAA, Ultra Quality Mode, and Quality Mode side by side, highlighting how Ultra Quality Mode, which can be used in any supported game by using the DLSS Override - Super Resolution option and setting it to 77% input resolution, delivers better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality that is definitely hard to notice in motion in all the game featured in the comparison. The fact that Ultra Quality mode seems to work so well makes it baffling that it isn't an official option available in games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DLSS 4 Ultra Quality Mode vs DLAA - Same Image Quality as DLAA but More FPS? | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UY67EY50nGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After its launch earlier this year, NVIDIA DLSS 4 has been implemented in over 125 games and apps, and the list is expanding every week with new games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-other-rtx-updates-shown-off-for-upcoming-and-existing-pc-games/">In the coming weeks</a>, F1 25, Dune: Awakening, MindsEye, and FBC: Firebreak will launch with NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, followed by the Soulslike Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, which launches on July 24th.</p>
<p>The release of NVIDIA DLSS 4 coincided with the launch of Multi Frame Generation, which is exclusive to the RTX 50 series cards, and the new AI Transformer Model, which delivers better image quality than the previous CNN model in the same modes. More information on the latest iteration of the upscaler can be found on its <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> is getting a sequel, developer Shift Up has confirmed. In the company's latest<a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng"> investor relations presentation</a>, a chart showing how the studio plans to grow going forward confirms plans for a Stellar Blade sequel, seemingly set to release sometime before 2027.</p>
<p>The chart also confirms plans for Shift Up's next game, an action RPG currently codenamed Project Witches, and plans for Stellar Blade's "platform expansion," which, if Xbox owners want to keep pie-in-the-sky hopes, could mean an Xbox version. But it is likely just referring to the PC version that is due next month.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>No Xbox version aside, a sequel is exciting news for fans of the 2024 action hit, especially if the studio is able to complete the game and release it sometime before 2027. Though that release window should be taken with a grain of salt for now, seeing as how there's always the chance for things to change or slow down development, no matter the studio or the project.</p>
<p>After being one of the most popular games in 2024, Stellar Blade will continue to be a part of the conversation with its PC launch this coming June 11, 2025. Though not for entirely positive reasons, unfortunately, as its release is currently marred by the fact that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/">not available to purchase on Steam in 130 countries</a>, despite not having any PlayStation Network sign-in requirements.</p>
<p>Shift Up has released a statement saying <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-dev-is-working-with-sony-to-resolve-pc-region-locking-claims-denuvo-doesnt-impact-frame-rates/">it is working to fix the issue as soon as possible</a>, though it's unclear if the problem will be resolved by launch.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-more-vertical-and-lets-you-go-anywhere-and-thats-why-it-doesnt-have-a-minimap/">Borderlands 4</a> doesn't have an official price yet, but there's plenty of speculation that it will go the way of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World</a> and sport an $80 price tag. When asked about the price at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-announces-new-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-and-digs-into-more-details-on-borderlands-4-at-pax-east-2025/">PAX East,</a> Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford gave a long answer about why pricing isn't his call to make, and how those on the publishing side are weighing all the options when it comes to pricing.</p>
<p>Pitchford was much more curt when responding to a fan on X, though. He reiterated to someone pleading with him not to make Borderlands 4 $80 that the price was not his call and that a "<em>real fan</em>" would find a way to buy it, even if it ends up being $80.</p>
<p>Commenting on Pitchford's post about the Creator's Voice video for Borderlands 4, <a href="https://x.com/oldgoldsot/status/1922412081023783167">X user oldgoldsot wrote</a>, "<em><span>Randy, this game better not be 80 dollars. Don't take that risk, alot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher</span></em>."</p>
<p>Pitchford's response boiled down to telling users to pull up their bootstraps if the $80 price tag is too high for them.</p>
<p>"<em><span>A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it</span></em><span><em> happen</em>,</span><span>" <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">Pitchford wrote</a>. "</span><em><span>My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.</span></em><span>"</span></p>
<p>It's not the best reply, if only because Oldgoldot's original complaint is more to do with the idea that players, like themselves, will vote with their wallet against games jumping up to $80. Whether they were a 'real fan' had nothing to do with it, and they didn't believe that Pitchford had absolutely no say when it came to pricing, as the chief executive officer at Gearbox.</p>
<p>Nintendo was the first to break the $70 ceiling by bumping up Mario Kart World to $80, followed by Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">increasing the price of its games and hardware</a>. PlayStation has bumped up the price of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">services and hardware across the world</a>, and while it hasn't seemingly done the same with its games, keeping <a href="https://wccftech.com/pre-order-the-ghost-of-yotei-from-amazon/">Ghost of Yotei at $70</a>, it's realistically only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Take-Two might have held back with <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> with a much lower-than-expected price of only $50, and it might hold back again with Borderlands 4, opting not to jump up to $80 but stay at $70. Regardless, it's unlikely that it will cost less than $70. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-3-leaked-september-13th/">Borderlands 3</a> launched in 2019, it did so at the then-standard $60 price. So players should expect to pay at least $70 for Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>But they shouldn't have to expect to be told to "<em>make it happen</em>" by studio bosses when the prices go up, especially when everything, including the cost of things more important than video games, is going up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel codenamed Project Orion is going to feature a second city to explore besides Night City, according to information provided by the creator of the Cyberpunk universe.</p>
<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/cyberpunk-2077-tworca-potwierdza-nowe-miasto-w-kontynuacji-to-chicago-ktore-poszlo-w-zla-strone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD-Action</a>, Mike Pondsmith recently talked with TVGRY during the Digital Dragon 2025 event, revealing that, while he is not as involved in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel as he was with the original game, he gets to see scripts, check out new cyberwar, and talk with the various departments at work on the game, including the environment design people. From these people, he probably learned that the second entry in the series will feature a second city besides Night City, which he described as having the feel of "Chicago gone wrong", rather than the Blade Runner-inspired atmosphere of Night City. While unable to share more, Mike Pondsmith added that he sees this city working for the game, so it will definitely be interesting to see how it will fit in the story and the universe.</p>
<p>Though we probably won't see the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion anytime soon, the franchise by CD Projekt Red entered the spotlight once again last month, when a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game was announced alongside the Nintendo system. Despite the technical differences with the other consoles, the port seems to be holding up quite well and could offer a much better on-the-go experience than the Steam Deck, judging from some <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">recent comparisons.</a> With CD Project Red putting so much <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">effort</a> into the port, including the entirety of the game on the retail edition's cartridge, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game become one of the most popular Nintendo Switch 2 launch releases.</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Project Orion, is currently in development for yet-to-be-announced systems. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>
