			<p>Despite being ripe for a video game adaptation, up until this year, it looked like no one would ever be able to release a game based on the popular Hellraiser franchise. While it will continue to be a mystery why so many failed to bring Pinhead and the other Cenobites to our screens, I can say for certain that, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/hellraiser-revival-survival-horror-game-saber-interactive/">Clive Barker's Hellraiser</a>, Saber Interactive is definitely on the right track to capturing what makes the franchise so great while delivering a survival horror experience that is both haunting and incredibly immersive.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last week, I had the chance to try out Clive Barker's Hellraiser, and the around 40 minutes I spent with the game have left me thoroughly impressed. The demo began right from the start of the adventure, showing how Sunny opens the Genesis configuration and gets ultimately kidnapped by Pinhead himself, voiced by Doug Bradley, returning to the role after 20 years, and other Cenobites. Following a quick jaunt into the haunting Labyrinth, Aiden gets kidnapped by a group of cultists, the original owners of the Genesis Configuration, whose ultimate aim seems to create their own Cenobites for some unspecified twisted goal. Right from these first few minutes, it's clear how some of the franchises' theme, such as the thin boundaries between pleasure and pain, are on full show, and completely coherent with the series' canon, which is not surprising considering this is a canon story within the series' universe.</p>

<p>After a very intense sequence where the player has to pick the right actions to release Aiden from captivity, at the cost of much pain, the proper game began, giving me a taste of what to expect in the full experience. In many ways, Clive Barker's Hellraiser is a rather traditional first-person survival horror, but its great atmosphere enhances the genre's typical gameplay elements such as puzzles to complete, and chase sequences where Aiden has to escape from Cenobites, sequences that are made more interesting by the unique design of the Labyrinth, which can make navigation confusion, but in a nicely haunting way that only adds to the immersion. Puzzles also seem quite varied, ranging from simply following unclear directions to navigational puzzles like some simple stealth sequences. In the first few minutes of the game, these puzzles were mildly complex without being too easy or too hard, so progression felt natural, although some backtracking was in order. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to acquire a weapon to test out combat in the time available, so it remains to be seen how the game will balance fighting enemies with every other gameplay element, and how the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration will come into play.</p>



<p>With a no-holds-barred approach to the series' most extreme elements, I feel Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival will be an excellent debut for the franchise in the video games space. Despite playing the demo in a fully lit room amid the familiar hum of chatter that defines events like Gamescom, it feelt unsettling and horrifying nonetheless, which speaks volumes about the excellent work Saber Interactive is doing. Hopefully, the game will be as great as it looked in this demo when it launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>A new The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 4K texture pack is now available for download, further enhancing the game's visuals for those playing the game on PC via a Nintendo Switch emulator.</p>



<p>The texture pack, whose 1.0 version was released a few days back on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/legendofzeldatearsofthekingdom/mods/161">Nexus Mods</a> after being in early access beta state for a while, upgrades all of the game's textures to 4K resolution, including terrain textures. Compared to the previous version of the texture pack, the 1.0 version also includes some texture additions and memory optimizations, as well as some fixes for glitched textures in shrines. As such, this version of the texture pack should be the most stable yet, allowing players to experience the latest entry in the series like never before. You can check out this The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom 4K texture pack before downloading in action in the video below released alongside the very first version of the modded textures last year.</p>

<p>Although PC players will continue to be able to experience The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom at its best for the foreseeable future, Nintendo Switch 2 owners can also enjoy the latest entries in the series with plenty of enhancements thanks to the upgraded versions released alongside the system earlier this year. Besides visuals and performance enhancements, the Nintendo Switch 2 versions of both games come with the Zelda Notes feature, which is a great addition to the experience, as Nathan highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on/">piece</a>.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. Learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-gamescom-hands-on-preview-racing-to-the-top/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-racing-crossworlds-gamescom-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-racing-to-the-top.1280448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, the first proper new entry in the series in over 8 years, already made 2025 a great year for fans of kart racers, those looking for a slightly more traditional approach to the genre have Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to look forward to. Appearances, however, can be very deceiving, as this more traditional approach is only the tip of the iceberg for a game that manages to combine spectacle with a tight balanced combination of different mechanics that not only make the game a joy to play, but also one that can be enjoyed to the fullest by players of all skill levels.</p>



<p>During Gamescom 2025 last week, I was able to try out Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for around 30 minutes, which, right from the onset, looked like they wouldn't be enough to truly understand the depth of the many options on offer, ranging from a massive character roster featuring a lot of characters taken from series besides the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise such as Steve and Alex from Minecraft, Spongebob and Patric, Pac-Man and the Ghosts, Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban Kasuga from the Like a Dragon series, the vehicle selection and customization options, which ranged from cosmetic to performance options, and a perks system which provided further depth. Having little time to check everything out, I simply picked out Sonic and the first vehicle that provided a balanced performance, a basic set of perks, which included the ability to store an additional item during a race, and went to race in one of the available cups, which comprised four different tracks.</p>



<div><p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is setting out to be an excellent kart racer balancing accessibility with depth</p></div>



<p>Up until this point, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds looked as traditional as a kart racer could get, and the first lap through the first track only reinforced this feeling. As soon as the second lap through the first colorful track ended, however, the new entry in the series showed how unique the experience is setting out to be. Instead of continuing on the same track, the player in first place has the chance to pick between two other tracks, which adds an incredible element of unpredictability to a race. In the blink of an eye, every player is seamlessly transported to a new track with its own set of gimmicks, which made each of the four tracks included in the cup exhilarating to play. With the final lap being set in the original track, however, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has everything in place to be accessible to every sort of player, even those who are only looking for some casual fun, casual fun that is easy to have in the game also thanks to some rather tight racing mechanics which feel great even if one were to ignore drifting, the vast item selection and the customization and perk systems outlined above.</p>



<p>Having only the time to play through a single cup, my time with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was somewhat short, but the little taste of the experience I had was more than enough to make me hunger for more and see for myself how all of these advanced mechanics will come together at higher difficulties and in online play. Thankfully, it won't be long for anyone to have a taste of the experience, as an open beta will be held later this week on August 29 ahead of the game's release on September 25 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, with a Switch 2 version to follow later in the year. One thing, however, already seems to be certain. Sonic Team managed to create a great kart racer with a solid balance between accessibility and depth that is sure to please all sorts of players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned game designer Hideaki Itsuno famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left CAPCOM</a> around a year ago after a thirty-year career at the Japanese company. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-creator-hideaki-itsuno-joins-tencents-lightspeed-to-work-on-aaa-action-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that he would become the head of a new Japan-based team at Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios, which would create action games, per his expertise.</p>



<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-veteran-itsuno-hires-devil-may-cry-street-fighter-royalty-for-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by VideoGamesChronicle</a>, LightSpeed has announced new milestones for the studio: the hiring of several key developers from CAPCOM and the opening of a new office in Osaka (Japanese developers will be able to choose whether they'd like to keep working from the Tokyo office or move to the new one, <a href="https://x.com/__lightspeed___/status/1960146677844861325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the official X account</a>).</p>



<p>As for the new hires, they're all former colleagues of Hideaki Itsuno:</p>



<ul>
<li>Writer Toshihiro Nakagawa, also known as Bingo Morihashi, has worked on Devil May Cry 2, 3, 4, 5, and both Dragon's Dogma games</li>



<li>Daigo Ikeno, an artist whose works include Street Fighter, Devil May Cry, and Dragon's Dogma</li>



<li>Gouda Cheese/Bengus(both fictional names), another artist who has worked on Street Fighter and Power Stone</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Actually, the new LightSpeed Japan Studio has roughly a third of its employees (around 40 in total for now) who came from CAPCOM, and Hideaki Itsuno highlighted the benefits of this choice in a statement shared with VGC: </p>



<p><em>Although we’re a new studio working on a new game, it’s good to be able to work with people who I trust like Mr. Nakagawa. I have been working with him for decades, since Devil May Cry 2, and he’s one of those core members who understands me very well. Ikeno-san is also participating as an art director this time, and Bengus-san has a very high level of understanding and is a very unique man – he was a legendary designer at Capcom.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s all about a sense of trust… we know exactly what each of us want. And it’s not just these three people: I also hired some other people I worked with from before at Capcom, so even though this is a new studio, I’ve gathered those people who I trust to make sure that this is going to be a successful game.</em></p>



<p>Hideaki Itsuno and his team are working on an original IP. Earlier today, Itsuno-san <a href="https://x.com/tomqe/status/1960151714423865732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a> that the team will work on a prototype that will 'delight players around the world', though they are still seeking creative directors. As such, it would be wise to expect a long wait before we hear concrete details on the game.</p>
