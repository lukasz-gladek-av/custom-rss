			<p>Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the Bloodborne PC Remaster project, is fixing one of the PlayStation 4 release's most significant graphical shortcomings, making the emulated version of the game the definitive way to experience the FromSoftware action RPG.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, the project's developer confirmed they have figured out how to replace the low quality distant meshes that Bloodborne uses frequently to optimize performance on PlayStation 4. </p>



<p>At 1080p resolution and with the vanilla game's depth of field, these low-quality meshes are hardly noticeable, but at higher resolution on PC, they definitely are. As even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">low-end machines have no trouble running the game with solid performance</a>, there's no need for these low-quality meshes anymore, which are being replaced with the full-fat version of the model. Judging from the video, the results promise to be stunning, enhancing the haunting beauty of Yarnham's central locations considerably with enhanced detail.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When these improvements will be added to the Bloodborne PC Remaster project has yet to be determined. However, those who wish to experience the game developed by FromSoftware with a slew of visual improvements can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">download the project's current version from Nexus Mods. </a></p>



<p>The latest version of the project, version 0.93, was released on October 14 to restore baked lighting for better visuals while retaining some of the project's best improvements, including dynamic shadows. For a game relying so much on its eerie atmosphere, these additions vastly improve the Bloodborne PC experience made possible by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amid the busy halls of the Makuhari Messe during this year’s Tokyo Game Show, we were able to carve out a brief fifteen minutes to talk with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Director Naoki Hamaguchi as Square-Enix was showing off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S|X releases of the first title in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy</a>. With questions being handled through an interpreter, we might not have gotten time to answer everything we wanted to know about the upcoming releases, but we were able to touch on some of the bigger questions on our readers’ minds.<a href=""></a></p>



<p><strong>In a <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt">recent interview</a>, you talked about how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be on a Game Key Card rather than a physical cartridge. Do you see Nintendo ever increasing the speeds on these Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges so that this would not be a requirement in the future?</strong></p>



<p>Personally, I feel that the loading speed issue for the game cartridge is more about the hardware spec of the Nintendo Switch 2. I’m not with Nintendo, so I can’t really speak to that side. That said, I do feel that the Game Key Card format that Nintendo created for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a really amazing new idea that they had offered for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t personally see Nintendo working towards trying to improve the loading speed for the cartridges. Rather, I feel that Nintendo will put more effort into popularizing the Game Key Card format which again is a really fantastic idea for us developers. Also, we hope players familiarize themselves with what that costs them. That obviously is something we can help out with as well, from the developer side.</p>



<p>I think that the collaborative effort between Nintendo and publishers trying to promote the Game Key Card will be the best way forward for all players in the future.</p>



<p><strong>These new versions of Final Fantasy VII Remake have several accessibility options, like Easy mode or infinite health, available through the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-dev-streamlined-progression-players-should-have-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamlined Progression feature</a>. Are these in reaction to the original release's too-difficult reception?</strong></p>



<p>Those features are not really about balancing the game. We’re actually quite confident about that because we did fine-tuning until the very end of development, so I think the balance itself is very good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason why we wanted to implement those features is to address the way modern audiences play video games being so diversified these days. Originally, with console video games, people would play on their TV in the living room, then we saw more players playing in their bedroom or on a PC. Now, we also see more players on handheld devices outdoors. In general, the way people approach and play video games is just so diverse, so we wanted to bring an idea that reflects that. It’s not just the way you play games in general, but we wanted to bring a diversified way to play <em>our</em> games, which is why we implemented those features.</p>



<p><strong>Would you ever consider developing a mobile version of the Final Fantasy VII trilogy?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, we do want to bring our games to a wider audience. When we look at the market landscape of the mobile side, particularly iPhone and Android users, we don’t really feel that there’s quite the demand to justify us creating a mobile port of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project. If there is a demand, we would definitely want to look forward to hearing that.</p>



<p>As of this moment, I don’t think the demand is quite there yet from a business perspective. We will continue to look at the market trends and if there is the right opportunity at the right moment, that’s when we will revisit this topic.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any plans for a DLC to bridge the gap between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and the third title in the Remake project, similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade?</strong></p>



<p>There were definitely some ideas to create a Rebirth DLC and that was the plan at a certain point in time, but when we revisited this topic and we thought about what our priorities should be and what the fans are looking forward to the most. We figured that what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible. That would take priority over the Rebirth DLC, so we decided to take that approach.</p>



<p>With that being said, once we release the third installment, there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment. With the conclusion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole.&nbsp;Whether we bring another new DLC or a full title, that’s something we are actively considering.</p>



<p><strong>If enough fans ask for it, would you consider a standalone Queen’s Blood game to be a priority?</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned in my previous response, the utmost importance right now is to work hard towards that third installment and make sure it gets released as soon as possible with the highest quality achievable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, the solo Queen’s Blood title is probably not in the list of our priorities. We actually haven’t determined any priorities after the release of the third installment, so things are really up in the air right now. If there is enough demand, a solo Queen’s Blood title is definitely something we can consider.</p>



<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has a massive soundtrack. My last question to you: is there one specific song that you’ve had on repeat or listened to the most out of the whole soundtrack?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, there’s the staples like the Final Fantasy main theme that we’ve heard over and over, but for me personally, I do like the Stamp song Bow Wow Wow (Chuken Stamp).</p>



<p><strong>It’s very catchy.</strong></p>



<p>I hope a lot of people like that track too.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>With its deep Job System, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles allows a wide variety of builds that can deal a lot of damage quickly. While many players focus on creating the perfect Physical damage build to <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-the-best-support-abilities-for-max-physical-damage/">break the damage cap</a>, there's a fun Magic build that can easily clear maps solo, and provide solid damage and support at no MP cost against bosses.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Build refined and thoroughly tested by the author, who completed <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> twice in Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty using different builds and party setups, on the up-to-date Steam release as of October 20, 2025. The build is also highly effective in Knight and Squire difficulties and in Classic Mode. Screenshots captured from the same version</strong></em></p>

<p>A female high Bravery Black Mage using the Samurai's Job Command Iaido with Auto-Potion Reaction Ability, Magick Boost Support Ability and Movement +2 Movement Ability offers superior Magick Attack and HP compared to every other Magick-focused Job, automatic healing against all damage, unparalled offense and support options and reliable high movement range needed to get into the Iaido abilities range (centered on the user) to support party members and deal massive damage to multiple enemies, and get away from them as needed.</p>

<h3 id="h-focus-on-iaido">Focus on Iaido</h3>



<p>Although high-level Black Magick spells like the -aja spells and Flare deal more damage, using the Iaido abilities, which scale with Magick Attack and ignore Faith, is the better choice. Not only Murasame can outdamage the -aja spells under certain conditions, every other Iaido ability except for Ashura can outdamage the -aga spells when an enemy is not weak against a specific element, with no casting time, no MP cost, no risk of friendly fire and better area of effect. The risk of getting into the enemies' face is offset by the Auto-Potion reaction ability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: After concluding the test against the Minotaur enemy, each ability was also tested against human enemies and monsters with no elemental weaknesses to ensure general consistency. Depending on the user and the target's Faith values, -aga and -aja spells can deal the same damage as Koutetsu's and Muramasa's Iaido abilities or more, but with no MP cost, no cast time, no Faith scaling and larger area of effect, their reliability still stands.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="h-high-movement">High Movement</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Movement +2 is the most reliable Movement Ability available to female units in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The recommended Movement +2 ability is crucial for the build, providing the needed reliable movement to use Iaido appropriately.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: Some players may prefer Teleport (Time Mage - 3000 JP) for its superior range and ability to bypass terrain and unit elevation. However, Teleport not only requires a lot of JP grinding to learn, but is also highly unreliable, its success rate dropping significantly for every tile you attempt to move past the unit's base Movemenet stat, which is only 3 for the Black Mage. This makes long-distance teleports very risky, often resulting in failed movement and higher risk of receiving high damage, which should be avoided for a low-HP Job like the Black Mage</em>, <em>regardless of the protection granted by Auto-Potion</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since the best Iaido abilities (<strong>Muramasa</strong>, <strong>Ame-no-Murakumo</strong>) and the supportive ones are centered on the user, movement and positioning are critical for both damage and party utility.</p>



<p>This movement flexibility allows the unit to reliably position itself to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hit a large group of enemies with any damaging ability or target multiple allies with Murasame (healing).</li>



<li>Apply zero-cost party buffs with Kiyomori (instant Protect and Shell) or Masamune (instant Regen and Haste)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-early-and-late-game-viability">Early and Late Game Viability</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-The-Ivalice-Chronicles-Black-Mage-Samurai-Master-Late-Game-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Black Mage Samurai build has no trouble clearing maps solo with the most powerful Katanas like the Kiku-ichimonji</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While this powerful build reaches its maximum potential in the late game - when the most powerful katanas can be purchased or <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-get-the-genji-gear-set-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/">stolen from certain enemies</a> - its viability is strong even during the mid game. The Black Mage Samurai Master can easily become an early asset to your party thanks to Kotetsu, the second purchasable katana, which already outdamages the -aga spells with no MP cost and zero cast time under the right conditions.</p>



<p>This build also allows you to bypass relying on the Arithmetician's Arithmeticks for high magic damage. While Arithmeticks offers superior tactical safety by allowing you to target units regardless of range, it always carries the risk of accidentally buffing or healing your enemies.</p>



<p>Armed with this build, you can easily take on the many challenges the game offers.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-gets-new-mod-monster-hunter-like-mechanics/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-3-gets-new-mod-with-monster-hunter-like-mechanics-and-a-massive-map.1329148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>An interesting new The Witcher 3 mod has recently appeared <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9426?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nexus</a> (<a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/new-the-witcher-3-dlc-sized-expansion-mod-adds-new-map-upgradeable-camp-and-unique-gameplay-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by DSO Gaming</a>). Created by Aeltoth, it is titled Wild Monster Hunt and it offers an alternative game mode inspired by CAPCOM's Monster Hunter series.</p>



<p>Wild Monster Hunt (WMH) allows you to start fresh playthroughs exclusively on WMH or join regular playthroughs to earn money. You get a camp that you can upgrade. It is similar to the Corvo Bianco home from the official Blood &amp; Wine DLC, but focuses more on providing advantages for monster hunting.<br>Aeltoth has created a big map, roughly the size of Toussaint. </p>



<p>Players will leave the camp to hunt monsters and complete procedurally generated contracts to earn gear and money. This allows them to craft better gear and hunt tougher targets. They can unlock new, unique items for expanded build crafting by using a special forge that is only available on this map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Since Wild Monster Hunt is an alternate game mode, the default way to start a new playthrough is by selecting "New Game" from the menu of The Witcher 3 and choose the Wild Monster Hunt quick-start option. There's a chance this option may crash, so if it happens to you, the modder recommends using the other method.</p>



<p>You can also join the Wild Monster Hunt level from a new signpost located east of White Orchard village, past the bridge, and after the wooden tower with guards. Joining the Wild Monster Hunt level via this signpost will adjust the loot tables and mechanics to ensure the game mode doesn't interfere with the usual progression. Players may leave the mod's level by interacting with the fast travel signpost inside the camp.</p>



<p>Additionally, it is possible to enable optional challenges by interacting with the camp's noticeboard. For example, Merciless Path turns the mod into a sort of extraction game where gear is lost upon dying. The mod adjusts the rewards when this mode is enabled to accelerate progression.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In related news, The Witcher 3 developer CD Projekt RED has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed cross-platform mod support</a>, which is now expected to arrive at some point next year. Just like other cross-platform mod systems, it will be powered by mod.io.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio's release of the REDKit modding tool in May 2024</a>, there was a bit of a renaissance when it comes to mod projects. A big one is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-dlc-2026-the-last-wish-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last Wish Project</a>, which aims to recreate the original book written by Andrzej Sapkowski.</p>
