			<p>Half-Life 2 Remake, an impressive fanmade remaster of the second entry in the popular series by Valve in the Source 2013 engine, is getting a playable demo before release to allow players to check out the impressive gameplay and visual improvements featured in the project for themselves ahead of the full release next year.</p>



<p>The demo was confirmed on the project's Mod DB page by GameROOSH, the developer behind the project. As of now, the developer is considering two different possibilities—a demo featuring a couple of levels or a remake of the Lost Coast demo that Valve itself released in 2005 to showcase the Source engine's HDR capabilities. While a decision has yet to be made, the developer seems to be leaning more towards the latter option to preserve first impressions of the project at launch.</p>



<p>The Half-Life 2 Remake project aims to remaster the original game's visuals with realistic graphics on par with those of modern games while properly conveying the game's unique atmosphere. Besides the impressive new visuals showcased in the screenshots below, the project will also feature new gameplay features, like realistic bullet simulation, destructible objects, and more to deliver an improved experience that fans of the original are sure to appreciate.</p>

<p>Fan projects like the Half-Life 2 Remake continue to be the only new releases related to the series. Still, the situation may change in the future, as a new entry in the series is rumored to be in active development. <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Earlier this year</a>, we learned that the mysterious project codenamed HLX may be close to the end of development, and some of its features, like the story, are being openly talked about in certain circles. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see what this project will be about, and if it will indeed be the Half-Life 3 that fans have been waiting for for decades.</p>

			<p>Hideo Kojima is disappointed in the current state of the video game industry, as there are too many games that look and play the same.</p>



<p>Speaking with Ssense, the legendary game creator commented on the current state of the video game industry following this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, noting how almost every game shown involved fighting either aliens or medieval monsters. It's not just the premise that seems to be almost identical, as Hideo Kojima finds that even visuals and gameplay systems are pretty much the same. While he understands that many people enjoy these games, he believes that it is important to put something really new for the industry, which is something that the legendary game creator has consistently been doing for years, especially with the release of the two Death Stranding games, and only indies seem to be doing nowadays. Being disappointed in a game industry that is putting out games that look and play almost the same, it's not surprising that Hideo Kojima is not going to play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake of the third entry in the series, which will not change the original's gameplay significantly.</p>



<p>Although Hideo Kojima's games often manage to set themselves apart from almost every other game out there, the legendary game creator hasn't been exempt from criticism, especially for its extreme involvment in many aspects of game development. However, he believes that it is this singular concentrated vision the reason of his success, as it allows him to work on multiple aspects of a game simultaneously, unlike a movie where the process proceeds step by step, starting with writing the script then moving on to storyboarding and production.</p>



<p>With Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now out, Hideo Kojima and his Kojima Productions studio are working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/">Physint</a>, which will mark his return to Metal Gear Solid's action/stealth formula, and the mysterious&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a>, which will be something totally different that people will either love or hate. Once the game is out, Kojima-san will listen to people's opinions, but reception won't matter, as he is sure the legacy of his games will be defined in the future.</p>

			<p>Despite the NES being an incredibly popular system, Nintendo was the only company making steady profit, according to a CAPCOM veteran Yoshiki Okamoto.</p>



<p>As reported by Automaton, the Japanese developer, who produced some of CAPCOM's best classic games like Street Fighter II, recently discussed in a video shared on YouTube how a third-party developer like CAPCOM struggled to earn money releasing Famicom/NES games. While he admits there are probably some exceptions, Okamoto-san says in the video that Nintendo was the only company making steady profits back then, as everyone else involved in the production of games didn't make much money, retailers included. For example, out of a game costing 10,000 yen, 3,000 yen went to the retailer, 4,000 yen to the developer, and 3,000 yen to Nintendo, with 1,500 yen going to the manufacturing contractors. The issue was that Nintendo had to be paid upfront for the exact number of copies, so only Nintendo was getting a guaranteed profit. Companies new to the console market at the time, like CAPCOM, did not have a lot of cash on hand, and so these upfront costs were a burden, often requiring taking out bank loans. With the time it took to deliver cartridges and for CAPCOM to get paid from distributors, the publisher would have to deal with six months' worth of bank interest, which would further eat into any profit CAPCOM made, together with every other cost, including the risk of having unsold copies.</p>



<p>With the arrangement above continuing to be a thing for years, it's unsurprising to hear Okamoto-san describe the launch of the first PlayStation as a revolution for third-party developers. During the first PlayStation era, CAPCOM's profit increased significantly, thanks to lower production costs and a more developer-friendly returns policy, as the company would give back to the publisher its share for unsold copies, essentially charging only the manufacturing costs. Restocking was also much faster, which allowed CAPCOM to take advantage of sudden popularity spikes of their games.</p>

<p>While Nintendo's first-party line-up was often more than enough to make its systems popular, the loss of third-party support for the Nintendo 64 was a decisive blow that compromised the system's popularity in many regions. Things have changed a lot since the late 90s, however, and with third-party developers aiming to massively support the Nintendo Switch 2, it looks like the company has finally managed to mend those relationships ruined by its old strict policies</p>

			<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q4 fiscal year 2025 results</a> show that Xbox content and services revenue grew 13% this quarter (12% when considering constant currency). Hardware revenue continues to decline (-22%), but overall gaming revenue is still up 10%. According to Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, the result was driven by 'better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass.'</p>



<p>During the subsequent investor call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared some new milestones, such as the fact that the Game Pass subscription service has nearly reached $5 billion of yearly revenue for the first time since its launch in 2017. Nadella also referenced the fact that Microsoft was the top publisher not only on Xbox but <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on PlayStation</a> this quarter. Lastly, the chief executive officer noted that Xbox has nearly 40 games in development.</p>



<p><em>When it comes to gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. And we are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter, with the successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger: 50 million people have played Black Ops 6. Total hours surpassed 2 billion.</em></p>



<p><em>Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of game play streamed via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.</em></p>



<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted, however, that Xbox revenue will likely decline in the first quarter of the next fiscal year due to a tough comparison with the previous year: </p>



<p><em>In Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid single digits.</em></p>



<p>Xbox Game Studios is about to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced</a> on PlayStation 5, no doubt hoping to repeat the excellent results of ports like Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The remaining release schedule for the publisher's calendar year includes Gears of War: Reloaded on August 26, Double Fine's new game Keeper on October 17, Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden 4 on October 21, and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 on October 29. There's also Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, although that one is technically published by Activision, which is nevertheless owned by Xbox.</p>
