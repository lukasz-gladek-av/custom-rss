			<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-qa-its-a-very-good-match-for-us-because-of-the-stories-we-want-to-tell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an exclusive interview with Alexander Mishulin and Andrey Tsvetkov from Owlcat Games about The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, which was announced earlier this month during Summer Game Fest 2025. During our conversation, we noted that this was a very different game from what Owlcat has made so far (Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, and Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, all of which are cRPGs). Interestingly, we learned that the studio has hired experts in third-person action RPG games, including some from CD Projekt RED:</p>
<p><em><strong>Alexander</strong> <strong>Mishulin</strong>: It was part of the process when we were in pre-production. We had to establish different processes. It's not difficult or something very special or an unusual transition; it's just a new process to make a new game. Also, we expanded our team for this project. We welcomed new team members from companies that have already done similar games, especially from CD Projekt, so we built not only upon our own expertise and knowledge but also upon our new colleagues' knowledge, which helped us quite a lot.</em></p>
<p>Speaking about the choice to go with third-person, Owlcat added:</p>
<p><em><strong>Alexander</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Mishulin: </strong>From the first pitch, it was all about making a third person game because The Expanse is about people. We want you to connect more with the characters, the protagonist and the companions, and we want you to be immersed in this very grounded, realistic, sci-fi world.</em></p>
<p><em>We wanted to show you that, and for that, we needed to change perspective and make things more realistic and cinematic. Because of that, we transitioned to the third person, and yes, we were a little bit afraid at the beginning. We started prototyping and made several combat and exploration arenas.&nbsp;We experimented with different approaches, how we wanted our cover system to work, how we wanted our enemies to work. Just for combat arenas, we had six prototypes in the beginning just to make the combat basics feel right.</em></p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn doesn't have a release date yet, but we look forward to learning more about it in the coming months. Stay tuned for more coverage on Wccftech.</p>
