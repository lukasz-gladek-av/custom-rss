			<p>Swedish developer MachineGames might have canceled an unannounced project a while ago. Timur222 <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1927629681982915009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> the tidbit of information earlier today while scouring the LinkedIn resume of a former Lead Artist who worked on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and this mysterious project between February 2022 and January 2024.</p>
<p>Needless to say, given the developer's history, Wolfenstein fans are worried that the canceled game is none other than Wolfenstein III. Following the launch of New Colossus in 2017, MachineGames worked on two spin-offs, the co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wolfenstein-youngblood-kids-alright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youngblood</a> and the VR game Cyberpilot, neither of which was well received. Back then, Bethesda's VP of Marketing Pete Hines had <a href="https://wccftech.com/pete-hines-confirms-wolfenstein-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a proper third installment to conclude the series would be made, but the years went on without such an announcement.</p>
<p>We now know that the studio dedicated itself to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but it's possible that they had a team working on Wolfenstein III and the project didn't pan out. Whether they will try again now that the Indy project is done remains to be seen. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was highly successful for MachineGames, earning unanimous praise from gamers and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press</a> alike. The game had registered four million players by January 2025, although it's always complex to gauge how many of those were full time sales with Game Pass in the mix. The subsequent launch on PlayStation 5 certainly helped.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-might-get-a-sequel-hints-phil-spencer-though-he-certainly-sounds-more-interested-in-owned-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened up</a> to a sequel in an interview last month. At the same time, he made it quite clear that he'd prefer Microsoft-owned teams to work on owned franchises, which Indiana Jones most definitely is not. Wolfenstein would fall in that category, but will MachineGames, Bethesda, and Microsoft give the franchise another try? I certainly hope so, as B.J. Blazkowicz's story needs a proper ending.</p>

			<p>A pretty sharp viewership decline was registered in The Last of Us Season 2 finale on HBO. The widely acclaimed debut season had over 8.2 million viewers in the United States despite airing at the same time as the Oscars ceremony. However, the season that just ended only registered 3.7 million viewers (<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Wrap</a>), a 55% drop. HBO cautioned that the numbers might increase and reminded everyone that the series has been watched globally by over 90 million viewers, with the second season averaging almost 37 million global viewers per episode.</p>
<p>It's all too easy to imagine the drop could have been caused by a certain character's death that gamers know all too well from The Last of Us Part II. However, HBO has already renewed the show for a third season, which will place a larger focus on Abby. In a press conference dedicated to The Last of Us Season 2 finale, series co-creator Craig Mazin <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-7-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>There is another side to this story that we have yet to really delve into. And there’s no question that Abby is the hero of her story. Where we go next, all I can say is it will always be centering on somebody, whether it’s Ellie and Dina or whether it’s Abby. But really, if you want to boil it down, everything is under the cloud or sunlight of Joel — what Joel did to Abby and what Joel did for Ellie — and that will never change.</em></p>
<p>In other franchise news, The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-avowed-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Last week, series creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the much-requested third installment could be made, but only if he and Naughty Dog as a whole can find a worthy story to tackle.</p>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>F1 games are ones I've played quite a lot in the past. Most of them, in reality. Having seen Codemasters grow the series and their acquisition by EA, it would always be interesting to see how they progress the series in the future. It was also going to be interesting because, and let's be completely honest, F1 as a motorsport does not change much, so what have Codemasters and EA done in <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a> to make it stand apart from the rest?</p>
<p>Brad Pitt, that's what they've done. I didn't even know there was a film based on F1 coming out, but now I do, thanks to the game and the fact that I have spent my time on F1 25 playing as Mr Pitt himself.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F1-25-Review-02-Passing-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So what is the link? Aside from them both being based on motorsport, Sonny Hayes is one of the drivers with the team from the film that you can take behind the wheel, even running a whole career mode as them rather than creating a different fictional team from scratch. This is what I did most of my time with the game: I played the My Team career mode, controlling APxGP and pushing them from the bottom to the top, all while keeping <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/7/7b/Tylerbetterpicture.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170410170911" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Durden</a> front and centre.</p>
<p>As you interact more with the drivers and backroom, the My Team mode feels more responsive and interactive than before. You will keep track of your rating by fans and their current sentiment, driven by your performance on the course. Your finances will be driven by the number of staff in each of your departments and their wages, your sponsorships, and, naturally, linked to your performance on the track. Do better, everything gets better. This is particularly true when you happen to enter a rivalry and beat them.</p>
<p>Between these, you will research and develop new parts that can be attached to your drivers and their cars. You will invest in your HQ, improve different facilities to increase staffing, and train your owner to get even more bonuses. It all creates a good sense of progression as you move from a brand-new team with few resources to a masterclass team with the best car on the track.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F1-25-Review-03-LIDAR-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, all of this is easier if you're good on the track. If there's one thing to say about F1 25, it's that it's the most realistic venture Codemasters has put out. Several tracks have been scanned using LIDAR (Laser imaging detection and ranging), which means every single centimetre is accurate in width and height. Not all tracks have been created using LIDAR, and some have had new features. Silverstone, for example, allows you to race in reverse.</p>
<p>In addition to improving the circuits, the elements surrounding the track add to the atmosphere. Codemasters gave an example in the build-up to release: the cherry blossoms around Suzuka, in the same place as real life. This adds to the exceptional visual quality and the feeling of being part of the race.</p>
<p>Now, I have to admit that at this point, I'm pretty terrible at the F1 games when I have zero assistance. I don't have everything on, and I don't like feeling railroaded. Still, I do tend to need the help to stop me spinning out and essentially creating a Final Destination moment as my car goes careening off into the spectators, killing dozens. Maybe the next tie-in Codemasters and EA could consider, though?</p>
<p>I find the handling and general racing to feel excellent, particularly when you find that balance where it's manageable for you, without making it too easy by crippling the AI. Added to this are other options that can make the game as sim or arcade as you like, even getting to the point where you can turn off penalties for turning it into Destruction Derby. This will always be a positive in any game, allowing you to play however you want.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F1-25-Review-04-F1-World-scaled.png"></a></figure>

<p>Now, there are some negatives with F1 25. I'm used to unskippable cutscenes and other annoying elements in your bigger story-focused titles, and they can be annoying. For an F1 game, it wasn't something on my bingo list. The build-up to a race feels a little too realistic, in that you're listening to commentators talk about how your special brand of rubber is the exact one used in a mastodon's condom, which is why it's perfect for corner 9, compared to that of the other teams. Those specific words may not be used, but it feels like they're trying too hard to set the scene, rather than letting me get behind the wheel.</p>
<p>I can't say I'm exactly fond of the microtransactions either, specifically because you can buy XP boosts. If they were <em>just</em> for cosmetic items, of which there are loads, I could live with it. XP boosts, though, I'll never support pay-to-win or pay-to-progress in a full-priced title. Ever.</p>
<p>Back to the positives. The four game modes give you something to enjoy, and while it isn't all out yet, due to the film not being out, I am strangely looking forward to following the story of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Brad_Pitt_as_Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac.jpg/250px-Brad_Pitt_as_Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac.jpg">Louis de Pointe du Lac</a>. This is even though I find the Breaking Point mode too railroaded. It seems the inclusion of <a href="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5cdacd630c67926f7fea3f72/1:1/w_1669,h_1669,c_limit/MCDTROY_EC007.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Achilles</a> is what makes the story interesting.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/F1-25-Review-05-Winner-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The more I play F1 games, the harder it is to talk about them. This is particularly true when the advancements are less noticeable. Codemasters have taken some steps forward with this one, certainly in terms of the accuracy of the tracks and in improving the handling. Still, their most significant step forward for me is expanding My Team. I want to see more, but I'm glad to take what I can for now. All in all, I would recommend F1 25. It's a very good racing game, and it's still the F1 game that will give you the closest F1 experience, warts and all.</p>
