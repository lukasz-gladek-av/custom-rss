			<p>As <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> continues to celebrate its <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-turns-six-users-streamed-over-1b-hours-to-date/">sixth anniversary</a>, <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> cloud gaming platform is arriving on more platforms to turn "<em>every screen into a gaming machine</em>." The GeForce NOW app is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-amazon-fire-tv-app/">officially live</a> on <strong>Amazon Fire TV</strong> devices, and <strong>eight games</strong> join the cloud gaming library. Including <strong>Warhorse Studio's</strong> medieval RPG, <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> and <strong>REANIMAL</strong>, the latest release from the original team behind the <strong>Little Nightmares </strong>games, <strong>Tarsier Studios</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes as part of yet another GFN Thursday, with a <strong>Capcom</strong>-dominated batch of games entering the cloud streaming service this week. Half of the eight games joining the service come from the <strong>Street Fighter</strong> and <strong>Resident Evil</strong> maker, including <strong>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</strong>, the <strong>Capcom Fighting Collection</strong>, the <strong>Capcom Beat'Em Up Bundle</strong>, and lastly, <strong>Mega Man 11</strong>.</p>



<p>Two of the games entering the service are doing so on launch, one being the aforementioned REANIMAL, which will be available as of tomorrow, <strong>February 13, 2026,</strong> with the other being <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/disciples-domination-arrives-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-february-2026/">Disciples: Domination</a></strong>, the turn-based strategy RPG from developer <strong>Artefacts Studio</strong> that's out today, February 12, on PC. They are also the only two games part of this week's batch that arrive as <strong>RTX 5080-ready</strong> titles.</p>

<p>The last but certainly not least game of the bunch to join the service is <strong>Torment: Tides of Numenera</strong>, a story-driven RPG that arrived on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/272270/Torment_Tides_of_Numenera/">Steam</a> last month and takes players to a futuristic version of Earth called the <strong>Ninth World</strong>. You'll play as the Last Castoff, someone connected with extreme power who gets caught up in a larger mystery. You'll face more than a few moral quandaries as you try to determine the meaning and value of an individual life in this blend of sci-fi and fantasy from <strong>inXile Entertainment</strong>, the studio behind the <strong>Wasteland</strong> and <strong>Bard's Tale </strong>franchises.</p>

<p>NVIDIA will be adding more games to the service as we get deeper into February, including some major releases like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong> at the end of this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Peter Molyneux</strong>, the original creator of the <strong>Fable</strong> franchise at <strong>Lionhead Studios</strong>, shared his first impressions on the upcoming reboot after watching the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent presentation at the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f-me-this-thing-that-we-created-its-going-to-live-peter-molyneux-cried-watching-xboxs-new-fable-gameplay-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with IGN</a>, Molyneux revealed that <strong>he got emotional</strong> at the idea that the Fable IP, which he and the rest of Lionhead spent so much time on, would return. He also pointed out that <strong>it was a good idea for Playground to reboot the series</strong>, and added that he agreed with the twist of the protagonist's village inhabitants turning to stone at the beginning of the game.</p>



<p><em>When I was watching the Fable trailer, I just felt myself tearing up. I know that I could probably be slaughtered for saying that, but I am someone who cries frequently, and I felt incredibly emotional, and the reason I felt emotional was: F*** me. This thing that we created, it's going to live, it’s going to carry on. This world, which we loved creating so much, and other people loved, has a life.</em></p>



<p><em>And for me, the saddest thing would be to see it diminish, which is one of the reasons I'm really going back to God games. So that was the overall emotion. I thought it was really smart of them to retell Fable 1 rather than have the burden of continuing the Fable story. I loved seeing some of those references. I thought it was super smart to have the kid’s family turn to stone. I thought that was really smart. And so those were all the plus points.</em></p>



<p><strong>He did have a few nitpicks</strong>, though, specifically directed toward the game's supposed "cleanliness":</p>



<p><em>If I was critical, which I think you want me to be, there was a slight antiseptic feel about it. But I mean, they've got months and months to build in that character and almost that dirtiness that you want in the world. I never thought Fable as being clean and all the angles being sharp and defined. It's more chaotic. It's more what Old England probably used to be, which was not straight lines, the place, it's more crinkling, and all the buckle belts on people are ridiculously large, and the boots and the hands ridiculously large because that is part of the character. So there’s a little bit more of that character, which I would probably foolishly and ridiculously ask for.</em></p>



<p>That said, Molyneux confirmed <strong>he absolutely plans to play the game once it comes out</strong>, which is supposedly this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>First, the game designer will have to focus on his own new game, the "God game" <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/masters-of-albion-release-date-22-cans-peter-molyneux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Masters of Albion</a></strong>, due to launch on Steam Early Access in late April. Molyneux called it <strong>the culmination of his life's work</strong>. The first gameplay trailer was released yesterday; you can find it below.</p>

			<p>While <strong>CAPCOM's</strong> <strong>RE Engine</strong> gathered a controversial reputation in the past few years due to the spotty performance of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/"><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2</strong></a></em>, the game engine fares significantly better in more linear games. Among the games that does not suffer from any major performance issues caused by the engine itself is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/"><strong><em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake</strong></a>, but a <strong>recent update</strong> to the PC version has essentially put the game in a <strong>worse condition than it was at launch</strong>.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Updating years old software with new DRM is stupid,"</em> noted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Digital Foundry’s</strong> Alex Battaglia. The tech expert's analysis confirms that on a Ryzen 5 3600/RTX 4070 Super build, the introduction of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Enigma Protector DRM</strong> has gutted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU game throughput by 40%</strong>. While the gap shrinks to 20% in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Village</em> fight due to the AI powering the enemies, which introduces a different bottleneck, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">impact remains constant</strong> in other scenarios.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Resident Evil 4 PC: Is New DRM Impacting Game Performance?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0TTbdff_vE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This isn't an isolated incident for the Japanese publisher. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">C</strong>APCOM has recently made similar moves with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Revelations</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 5</em>, sparking a wave of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">anti-consumer backlash</strong> across the community. As YouTube user @chemeergency put it: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Retroactively implementing new DRM over old DRM is insanely anticonsumer."</em> And it's not doing the publisher any favors, either, as some may be more inclined to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">go with the pirated version</strong> for better performance.</p>



<p>With <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></em> on the horizon, some may wonder if the latest entry will be similarly impacted. However, the game is <strong>confirmed to use Denuvo on PC</strong>, complete with the standard five-activation limit. While <strong>Denuvo</strong> has its own issues, its <strong>impact on performance is lighter</strong> than <em>Enigma Protector</em>. Hopefully, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> will realize that protecting three-year-old games at the cost of the player experience is a losing battle by the time the <strong>ninth entry</strong> in the series requires a DRM update.</p>
