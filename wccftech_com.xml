			<p>Codemasters announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-announced-for-may-30-launch-pc-requirements-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a> will join the extremely elite club of games supporting path tracing. Just like with all the others (Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Portal with RTX), the feature is a PC exclusive.</p>
<p>On the subject, the developer said:</p>
<p><em>Expanding on Ray Tracing technology and available as a new “Ultra Max” option in the graphics settings, light now follows every bounced path, including that from indirect lighting and multiple reflections. Shade, light, and colours dynamically shift as they would in real-life, whether you’re racing under the thousands of lights in Bahrain or navigating the castle section on Baku at sunset.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have a PC capable of experiencing it, Path Tracing is the most realistic simulation of light on track that we’ve ever delivered.</em></p>
<p>These aren't the only visual and technical improvements that fans will find in F1 25. Tonemapping and light balance improvements promise a more dramatic effect in all types of weather, with better representation of changes in cloud cover. There are also some enhancements to the track surface shader, which now displays more pronounced tyre and lock-up marks as well as physical changes based on other collected real-world data.</p>
<p>The addition of light detection and ranging scanning (LIDAR) makes tracks far more accurate overall. LIDAR also helped trees and foliage better match the species, placement, size, and shape of their real-life counterparts, with new additions such as cherry blossom trees in Suzuka.</p>

<p>Codemasters also introduced NVIDIA Audio2Face. This technology (already seen in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl) improved the facial animations that players will see during modes such as Career and Braking Point. The reintroduced press interviews now capture drivers delivering their responses in a more authentic fashion, with this technology extending to facility heads in My Team. Lastly, PS5 Pro console users will enjoy split-screen racing at 60 frames per second in this year's edition of the official F1 racing game.</p>
<p>Codemasters hasn't shared the system requirements for path tracing usage on PC, but we'll let you know once it does. F1 25 will be available on May 30 across PC and consoles.</p>

			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> CI Games <a href="https://x.com/CIGamesOfficial/status/1912876320360439961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that there will be a small delay to the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0 on Steam due to a technical issue. The Epic Games Store, Windows Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X versions are unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> Today, CI Games launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen 2.0</a>, a 'definitive' update to the Soulslike game that seeks to address several of the community's requests. Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates. The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.</em></p>
<p>As the executive mentioned, the game now includes fully shared co-op progression and a Free Friend's Pass. There's now free access to the character creator and the entire tutorial area of the base game. Following the completion of the tutorial, players can experience the entire adventure in online co-operative multiplayer when playing with a friend who owns the base game. Character progress and loot are saved between sessions, though only the host retains world progression.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen 2.0, both co-op players save all mainline story progress when on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough, having killed a similar number of main bosses (within one). Defeated bosses and lit beacons persist in both worlds; both players can revive each other and collect 100% vigor and all loot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen 2.0 Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WOqW5SRwYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are also other improvements to be found in Lords of the Fallen 2.0. The character creator now includes improved facial options, skin textures, and body shapes for both male and female models. The User Interface has been overhauled to be cleaner and easier to navigate, and a new guidebook has been added so players may reference previous tutorial prompts at any time.</p>
<p>The combat system now has more accurate weapon handling and refined lock-on mechanics. Mobility has been improved, featuring quicker evasion moves and more responsive controls. A dedicated jump button improves the platforming experience. Weapon audio was enhanced, amplifying every swing, parry, and block. A brand-new Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic now highlights the path forward through Mournstead. Lastly, new grievous strike button prompts have been added.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a free update for existing users. Any potential newcomers can now get the game at discounted pricing:</p>
<p>● PlayStation Spring Sale (April 9th – April 23rd):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 72% off at $19.60<br>
○ Deluxe Upgrade Pack (from Standard to Deluxe): 72% off at $5.60<br>
● Xbox Spring Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 70% off at $20.99, also included in Game Pass<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 70% off at $23.99<br>
● Steam Custom Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10<br>
● Epic Games Store Savings (April 10th – April 24th):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10</p>
<p>The game didn't score highly <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, but perhaps he'll be willing to give it another chance with the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-7/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> features more than 100 notes to collect and read, and it's worth searching for each one. Compulsion Games knocked it out of the park regarding storytelling in South of Midnight, and these notes are no exception.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll notice more notes to grab in this chapter than in any previous chapter. So if you were going to try and find them yourself, it's best to be vigilant about searching an area before you move on.</p>
<p>But if you're already here, I imagine you want to make sure you don't miss any of the 15 notes in Chapter 7. Here's where to grab each one.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 had 11 notes to find, Chapter 6 had 10, and now Chapter 7 has 15. And that's not even the most you'll see in a single chapter. But that's still to come.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Lost Boy</strong> - At the start of the chapter, follow the path until you hear Hazel point out the old sawmill, which will happen just before you're about to jump across a river. Jump across, and turn left to find a climbing path that leads you up and around the rock wall to an area blocked by the bramble and vines. You'll find the note on a box next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lost Liquor</strong> - You'll find this note after the first combat encounter of the chapter. Once you've cleared it, look to the right and you'll likely be able to spy a health filament behind some branches. You'll find the note resting on some boxes just ahead of the branches, and since you're there, you might as well grab the filament.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lieutenant Laurent</strong> - When you reach the memory object showing a clip of Hazel's mother, look to your right. You'll find the note on an old dresser at the entrance to a path with a box and a Floof knot to jump to.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Babblin' Boy</strong> - After finding the last note and crossing the river, turn left to find a path blocked by some branches you can push out of the way. Behind them, you'll find the note on a box next to a metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Baby Faced Laurent</strong> - From the last note, follow the path, and you'll have to cross the river again, using echoes of a bridge to do so. Once you've passed the echo bridge, turn left, and you'll find this note on a box next to another metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Lil' Drunkards</strong> - After finding the last note, follow the path and jump over two big bramble vines. You'll see this note in a hollow dead tree that should be directly in front of you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>End of Prohibition -&nbsp;</strong>After clearing the combat encounter that ends with you using Crouton to clear the Stigma, you'll head under a large tree as you follow the path to leave. This note is to the right of the path, underneath the tree.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Boy out of Time</strong> - You'll find this note almost immediately after you find the last one. Once you walk beyond the tree, you'll see a building to your right. The note is resting on a structure just on the porch of the building.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Heart of Lace</strong> - After the cutscene with Laurent at the Juke Joint, head back into the shop and go up the stairs. You'll find this note on a box next to Laurent and Lacey's picture.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> - Once you reach Milltown after using the grapple, head straight down the path, and you'll find this note inside the house on the right, on a table next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Mother's Last Words</strong> - Inside the same house you find the last note in, this note is on a bedframe at the back of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Everything Helps</strong> - When you enter Milltown, you'll be able to see a broken-down well to your left. Turn left past the well, and then look to your right to see a building that's missing a wall. Walk into the building to find this note on a box on your right, just ahead of a combat encounter.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Father's Job</strong> - After clearing the combat arena just beyond the last note you found, and watching the first of Laurent's memories, this one will be waiting for you in a building to the right of a big crane, next to two giant saws crossed over each other and making an 'X'.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Penny Saved</strong> - You'll find this one on the second floor of the sawmill, which you reach after finding all four of Laurent's memories. When you make it to the second floor, you'll use your grapple to cross a big gap around the outside of he mill. Once you're back inside, look to your left to see some wood you can push out of the way. Push that, then another bundle of wood, and you'll see this note resting on a table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Maintaining Productivity</strong> - This last note can be found in the office, just beyond where you found the previous note. You'll also find a Floof knot in this office, right next to the note on a desk.</p>
<p>And that's where you can find all 15 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 7. If you've followed these guides so far, you'll have found 53 out of the 103. Only 50 more to go.</p>
