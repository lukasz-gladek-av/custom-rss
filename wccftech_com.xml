			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">At The Game Awards last week</a>, Capcom finally confirmed what we already knew, thanks to a myriad of leaks: that Leon Kennedy would not only be in Resident Evil Requiem but also be<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/"> the second protagonist alongside the previously introduced Grace Ashcroft</a>, and that we would get to play as him.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">all the rumours</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/">speculation</a>, and then the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/">massive leak ahead of the official reveal</a>, it was good to finally see Leon in Requiem's trailer at The Game Awards, which felt like a sort of vindication for the internet after Capcom tried to deny he was involved.</p>



<p>Now that the secret is officially out, Capcom is already talking about Leon's appearance in Resident Evil Requiem and what he brings to the table alongside Grace Ashcroft. Of course, he's a fan-favourite character, but according to the game's director, Koji Nakinishi, Leon brings more than just his iconic status to Requiem, which is a striking contrast between him and Grace, and how differently players feel when controlling each of them.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60614">Famitsu</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/leon-kennedy-is-the-strongest-person-in-the-history-of-resident-evil-says-requiem-director-1648453/">Gamereactor</a>), Nakinishi called Grace the "<em>most fearful</em>" character in Resident Evil history, while Leon is "<em>the strongest</em>" in Resident Evil, according to Nakinishi. "<em>Grace is the most fearful person in the history of Resident Evil, and Leon is the strongest,</em>" Nakinishi said. "<em>I think one of the highlights will be seeing how these two contrasting characters interact</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We've crafted it to bring out the best in the contrasting characters of Leon and Grace</em>," Nakinishi continued. "<em>It's a gameplay experience unlike anything in the Resident Evil series before, so I hope you'll give it a try</em>."</p>



<p>A good horror game is able to strike a balance between how powerful the player feels and how vulnerable they feel in a given situation. Several games in the Resident Evil series are undoubtedly terrifying, but some of them, including entries featuring Leon, lose control of that balance before you hit credits, and you lose the fear-factor once you know you can bulldoze through any zombie or mangled creature the game puts in front of you.</p>



<p>It seems that with Resident Evil Requiem, Capcom is taking a very direct approach by having you play as both Grace and Leon for different scenarios. It'll be interesting to see how it executes that balance, and if the pendulum swings the other way at unexpected points, like finding yourself powerless while playing as Leon, and vice versa while playing as Grace.</p>



<p>Whatever Resident Evil Requiem has in store for players, we'll be able to find out when it arrives on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026</p>

			<p>Rainbow Six Siege celebrated its 10-year anniversary at the beginning of this month, on December 1, 2025, and as part of the celebrations, Ubisoft has put out <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/events/wildcards-siege">a new limited-time mode titled Wildcards</a>, which'll be available from December 15, 2025, to January 5, 2026.</p>



<p>The new mode takes players back through the game's history by making every match more chaotic than the last with different modifiers. A modifier could limit your choice of operator, of weapons, and even add a new element to gameplay, like a massive Chicken appearing in your face as a callback to an iconic moment in Rainbow Six Siege's 10-year history.</p>



<p>There are 28 total modifiers, including Multipick, which lets teams pick the same Operator multiple times. Frag Domination, which randomly spawns frag grenades during the round. Frag Grenade Cooking, which equips attackers with the 556XI and defenders with the MP5K. Both teams still get grenades they can cook and throw.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Each round begins with a vote, where players will vote for their preferred modifier. Votes from both attackers and defenders are tallied together, and in the case of a tie, a modifier is randomly selected. It's a purposely chaotic mode that seems to try to hit at all of Siege's best points.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege recently underwent its most significant change in the last decade when it became a free-to-play game with the Rainbow Six Siege X update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">which Ubisoft released this past June</a>. It was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-announced-with-graphical-audio-and-gameplay-improvements-showcase-set-for-march-13/">biggest graphical update in the game's history</a>, and gave players the chance to, for free, play unranked, quick match, and dual front modes and play as a small selection of Operators. </p>



<p>You can take advantage of that free content as much as you like, and if you do want to go further in the game, you can grab the Elite Edition, which adds 16 more Operators and access to all game modes, ranked playlists, and the Siege Cup for $19.99. The Ultimate Edition includes all of that and access to all 52 Operators for $39.99.</p>
