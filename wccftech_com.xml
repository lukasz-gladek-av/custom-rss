			<p>Today, Jagex has unveiled RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a new game set in the beloved fantasy setting made popular by the 24-year-old MMORPG. It's an&nbsp;<span>open-world survival crafting game with cooperative multiplayer support for up to four players, and it will debut this Spring&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. This is the studio's first proper spin-off to be released after they </span>canceled the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unannounced-runescape-action-rpg-jagex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous action RPG project</a>.</p>
<p>Jon Bellamy, CEO of the Cambridge-based developer, stated:</p>
<p><em>We’re so excited to finally give players a glimpse at the next entry in the RuneScape franchise today with RuneScape: Dragonwilds. This is an entirely new RuneScape experience set within the iconic world of Gielinor and is a game which is worthy of wearing the RuneScape name. From the very beginning, community feedback has been at the heart of RuneScape: Dragonwilds. We’ve already conducted closed alpha tests with some of our closest community members, and we’ll be listening to player feedback when building the game throughout Early Access. We’ve built an entirely new team filled with industry veterans who are focussed on making sure that RuneScape: Dragonwilds sits naturally within the RuneScape franchise, and a game that is loved by both our biggest RuneScape fans and entirely new players alike.</em></p>

<p>The backdrop is that, as suggested by the title, dragons have awoken on RuneScape's forgotten continent of Ashenfall. Players will have to master survival while uncovering ancient secrets to try and slay the Dragon Queen, who appears to be positioned to be the final boss.</p>
<p>They'll get to use what Jagex described as 'wild, transformative magic' to gather resources, such as exploding ore veins with a finger snap or conjuring a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in a single hit. RuneScape: Dragonwilds also reportedly features a unique progression system that players will use to unlock new spells and craft recipes and abilities.</p>
<p>Jagex estimates that early access should be completed in early 2026, though that may vary depending on player feedback. RuneScape: Dragonwilds is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but the system requirements listed on the store page are quite low.</p>

			<p>A remaster of The Sinking City, the Lovecraft-inspired open-world detective game released back in 2019 by Frogwares on PC and consoles, has been announced today ahead of the end of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/">sequel</a>'s <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-shows-off-gameplay-and-launches-kickstarter-campaign/">Kickstarter campaign</a> conclusion.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the remaster, which will be available for free to all owners of the original game on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, will feature an upgraded visual experience, sporting 4K textures, new lighting, improved detail and reflections, 4K textures, support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and TSR upscaling and more. The Sinking City Remastered will also feature some requested quality-of-life features as well as a brand-new Photo Mode, providing players with plenty of reasons to dive back into the flooded city of Oakmont together with Charles Reed.</p>

<p>The upgraded visuals featured in The Sinking City Remastered will make the experience even more immersive, as the original game definitely nailed the atmosphere. Hopefully, the quality-of-life improvements will make the game more fun to play, especially the combat, which I found pretty lacking compared to the excellent investigation mechanics, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-sinking-city-strongest-fear-unknown/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Sinking City is probably the best Lovecraft-inspired game currently available on the market, thanks to its oppressive atmosphere and its story, which utilizes the lore masterfully without deviating from the canon. AI and technical issues, as well as the clunky combat, are often immersion-breaking, but the excellent investigation mechanics and exploration features make it easy to look past these issues. Highly recommended to survival horror fans and those who live and breathe Lovecraft.</em></p>
<p>The Sinking City Remastered launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pocketpair Announces Palworld Dating Sim]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/pocketpair-announces-palworld-dating-sim/</link>

			<p>The April Fool's dating sim from Pocketpair has made a return, and this time, it doesn't seem to be a joke. Last year, Pocketpair released a trailer for a dating sim called Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, where it was released as an April Fools joke.</p>
<p>However, today, Pocketpair has released another trailer for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, an the game seems legitimate and actively developing. So, for those who want to date some of the pals you find in Palworld, this will be your opportunity. There is now an <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?snr=1_5_1100__1100&amp;utm_source=steamwidget" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active Steam page</a> for the game, where you can wishlist it and get a little bit more information about what the game will be.</p>
<p>Below is the trailer that was released today by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">Palworld developers</a>. From the description on the YouTube video, it seems that the game will be available to wishlist on Steam and the PlayStation Store. Thus far, there is no mention of whether this will be available on Nintendo Switch or Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ | 2nd trailer | Palworld | Pocketpair" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUpilXM6638?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this title, you enroll as a transfer student in the Palpagos Private Academy, where you will be introduced to some unique friends (pals) and get to enjoy the school life alongside them, with the option to romance them along the way. You can choose whether you stay friends with them or work on a romantic relationship with them. There is also the third option of dismembering and eating them if you want a touch of horror to your gaming experience.</p>
<p>The Steam Page for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ also reveals some of the students that you will meet, including Lovander, Chillet, Zoe, Chillet Ignis, Quivern, Nurse Saya, Tarantriss, and more. It seems that there is a wide range of options for those who want to participate in learning the stories of each character, with some seeming on a bit of the darker side of things.</p>
<p>From the screenshots available, it seems to share similarities to Doki Doki Literature Club, luring you into a false sense of security. There are two trailers for the game, with one of them being the trailer that was released as an April Fool's joke last year.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no set release date for this title, and the announcement has come very suspiciously close to April Fool's once again. The Pocketpair Community Manager, John "Bucky" Buckley, assured Eurogamer that this is, in fact, legitimate and not another April Fool's joke.</p>
<p>So, will you be playing Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~?</p>
