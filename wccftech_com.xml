			<p>Just two days before the end of 2025, <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/gog-acquired-by-co-founder-from-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had sold its digital video game distribution platform <strong>GOG</strong></a> (formerly <strong>Good Old Games</strong>) to <strong>Michał Kiciński</strong>, who had co-founded the company (and CD Projekt RED itself), for $25 million.</p>



<p>Now, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has published an interview with Kiciński</a>, who had retired after leaving CD Projekt RED on the very day that the company shared the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original Cyberpunk 2077 teaser trailer</a>, on January 10, 2013. After several years out of the gaming industry, Kiciński appears eager to dive back in and is unafraid of the proverbial elephant in the room: <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just surpassed a new user concurrency record this past Sunday</a>. </p>



<p><em>I see opportunities more than negatives, that's my nature, and I see huge opportunities for GOG to grow. And somebody might say that having a competitor like Steam with 80% of the market share is a huge obstacle, but to me, it's the opposite. I see: 'Oh, there is one big competitor, it'll be difficult for them to defend the market, because they already have 80%, so it should be easier to take the market from them.' GOG has its own strengths and really should focus on maintaining them and even strengthening them. There is no need to try to be like the others. GOG has its own identity and its own uniqueness, which is very much appreciated by gamers.</em> <em>Steam is winning with its ease of use. In that regard, I think much can be done in GOG without losing its core values and the way it operates in general.</em></p>



<p>In any case, Kiciński <strong>clarified that he does not plan to directly challenge Steam on triple-A game offerings</strong>, as Epic Games Store did, instead favoring deals with smaller developers and publishers. However, the platform <strong>will continue to sell CD Projekt RED's games at a rate favorable for the Polish developer</strong>, so fans who'd like to support CDPR should still pick GOG over other platforms if they want more of their money to go directly toward the studio.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Showcase to Air this Thursday; Video Description Mentions ‘Games’]]></title>

			<p>This morning, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2010895134653837413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a new <strong>Resident Evil Showcase</strong> will air this <strong>Thursday, January 15</strong>, at 2 PM Pacific Time/5 PM Eastern Time/10 PM GMT/11 PM CET.</p>



<p>The stream will, of course, focus on <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, which is now just a month and a half away from its scheduled <strong>February 27</strong> launch date. However, there are hints that some other game may briefly appear, too. The official website says:</p>



<p><em>Don't miss the 12-minute Resident Evil Showcase special, featuring all the latest info on Resident Evil Requiem! Airing January 15, 2026!</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The date and time of the event may change without prior notice.</em></li>



<li><em>Some of the games included in the show aren't suitable for children.</em></li>



<li><em>This content will be age restricted. Age verification will be required to view this content.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Fans are hoping this means CAPCOM may take the opportunity and announce <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> ports of the <strong>Resident Evil 2 and/or 4 remake</strong>. Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village, and Requiem are already scheduled to hit the latest Nintendo console on February 27, 2026. Of course, this could also be standard phrasing that the publisher reuses for its showcase announcements without much consideration for whether the event will actually feature one or more games. </p>



<p>The 12-minute running time would definitely be pretty tight, with most of it undoubtedly reserved for Requiem. Even more unlikely is any announcement of the next rumored remakes, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-resident-evil-remakes-code-veronica-2027-zero-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Code: Veronica (2027) and Resident Evil Zero (2028)</a></strong>, which will have to wait until after the new entry has launched.</p>



<p>Anyway, the publisher invited fans to stick around on the Capcom USA Twitch channel after the end of the Resident Evil showcase for a discussion with guests Bawkbasoup and JenIsOnline, followed by a giveaway of a Resident Evil 4 Collector's Edition. </p>

			<p>A few hours ago, publisher <strong>Nexon</strong> and developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong> announced that the third-person extraction shooter game <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> has now sold <strong>more than 12.4 million units</strong> to date since its launch on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>. The announcement confirms Alinea Analytics' latest estimates, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which had already indicated last week</a> that the game had surpassed 12 million copies. Moreover, the game registered around 960,000 concurrent players this month, not far from the impressive threshold of one million concurrent users (presumably across all platforms).</p>



<p>It is yet another confirmation, if needed, that ARC Raiders is incredibly good at maintaining its momentum so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>despite the AI voices controversy</strong></a>. Of course, the game's live service run has just started. Anyway, as a thank-you gesture for all the support, Embark is giving away a <strong>Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool</strong> to everyone who logged into the game at least once since launch till today at <strong>23:59 Central European Time</strong>.</p>



<p>The press release included the usual celebratory statements from Nexon and Embark. Junghun Lee, President and CEO of Nexon, stated:</p>



<p><em>We are incredibly pleased with the strong retention and enduring enthusiasm players in all major markets worldwide have shown for ARC Raiders. As pleased as we were with the October launch, reaching more than 12.4 million units and setting a record with 960,000 concurrent users in January demonstrates the potential for ARC Raiders to become another pillar in Nexon’s portfolio of blockbuster franchises. Embark Studios has delivered exactly what players worldwide have expected from the game, a fresh, highly differentiated experience in a massive global game genre. ARC Raiders’ success is a clear affirmation of Nexon Group’s goal of expanding our global footprint with horizontal growth from all-new games that capture and grow massive game communities in every major market and on multiple platforms.</em></p>



<p>Patrick Söderlund, Founder and CEO of Embark Studios, added:</p>



<p><em>Hitting 12.4 million units is a huge landmark—and it wouldn’t have happened without our players. The community of raiders has been part of this journey from the start, and their ideas and enthusiasm continue to guide where the game goes next.</em></p>



<p>ARC Raiders has earned the <strong>Best Multiplayer Game</strong> prize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at The Game Awards 2025</a> and the <strong>Most Innovative Gameplay</strong> prize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Steam Awards 2025</a>. It's also well-positioned to win <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2025-the-power-of-togetherness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's Best Multiplayer Game award from the community</a></strong>, although voting hasn't closed yet.</p>
