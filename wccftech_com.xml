			<p>On the heels of releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-title-update-1-1-2-0-new-map-aim-assist-change/">the second major update</a> to Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">in its Season 1 roadmap</a>, EA will let players who haven't yet bought into Battlefield this year try it out for themselves with a week-long free trial of the game's classic multiplayer, specifically its flagship All-Out Warfare.</p>



<p>The free trial will kick off on November 25, 2025, and last for a full week until December 2, 2025. Players will be able to play five different game modes across three maps, including the two most recently released maps, Blackwell Fields and Eastwood.</p>



<p>"<em>From November 25 to December 2, ultimate all-out warfare is free for everyone</em>," a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-california-resistance-mid-season-roadmap">blog post on the Battlefield 6 website reads</a>. "<em>Fight in intense urban combat on the streets of Cairo. Drop into iconic SoCal landscapes turned into battlegrounds on Eastwood and Blackwell Fields. Enter Battlefield's iconic massive scale warfare</em> <em>in Conquest or Breakthrough</em>."</p>



<p>The free trial goes live less than two weeks after the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is reportedly missing the mark when it comes to commercial sales, according to early sales reports. In the EU specifically, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">Black Ops 7 was 63% behind the first week EU sales for Battlefield 6</a>.</p>
