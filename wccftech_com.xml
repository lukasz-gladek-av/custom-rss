			<p>Warhorse Studios has <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1889706030226956469/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> the imminent launch of official mod support for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The developer also revealed that it will be implemented through Steamworks rather than other options like Mod.io. As such, you should be able to download mods directly through Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>This will, of course, be in addition to all the regular mods that have been released and will continue to be released via platforms like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods?BH=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> some of the convenience mods last week, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-4k-skins-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skin mod</a>, but there's a lot more you can find there. There are 412 Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods on Nexus, 291 of which were released in the last seven days. With the official mod integration, the community will have even greater incentives to continue improving, tweaking, and enhancing the game. Presumably, official mod tools will be released, too, although that was not explicitly confirmed at this point.</p>
<p>Warhorse's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was a resounding success on all accounts. Commercially, it has already recouped costs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold over a million units</a>. Critically, it stands at 88 average score on Metacritic. This includes our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10 score from Chris Wray</a>:</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>The release of official mod support won't be the end of Warhorse's work for this game. The Czech studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> its 2025 roadmap, announcing a free update for Spring (bringing barber, horse racing, and Hardcore mode), the Brushes With Death DLC for Summer, the Legacy of the Forge DLC for Autumn, and the Mysteria Ecclesiae DLC for Winter.</p>
