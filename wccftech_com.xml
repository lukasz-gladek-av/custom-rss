            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Alinea Analytics' report that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had sold more than six and a half million units</a>, publisher Electronic Arts has now confirmed that the game has indeed sold more than seven million copies just in the first three days.</p>



<p>This means Battlefield 6 is officially the biggest franchise launch ever. Over 172 million matches were played online during the first weekend, and players accumulated over 15 million hours of streaming. As previously reported, the game also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered the most concurrent players in Battlefield history</a>. </p>



<p>Byron Beede, General Manager of Battlefield, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>First and foremost we want to thank our players. Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we've had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning - our first season of new content is just 12 days away.</em></p>



<p>Vince Zampella, Executive Vice President, added:</p>



<p><em>We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point. We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6’s momentous launch. We have so much more to come in the weeks ahead.</em></p>



<p>The game earned an 8.5 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review by David Carcasole</a>, who pointed out that while the single player campaign is lackluster, the multiplayer modes are rock solid, marking the franchise's comeback after Battlefield V and 2042.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the developers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-naval-warfare-reportedly-in-development-ea-battlefield-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly already working to add naval warfare</a>. On the live servers, they have also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-conquest-mode-players-arent-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced the starting ticket count on Conquest maps</a>, although that change didn't go over too well with the community.</p>

			<p>The Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT mod breathes new life into the visuals of the classic game, but the performance cost is considerable—even on a top-end GPU like the RTX 5080.</p>



<p>The mod, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/">first work-in-progress release</a> was launched earlier this month, uses RTX Remix to overhaul the visuals of the iconic No Mercy campaign with realistic lighting, high-resolution PBR materials, and full compatibility with ray tracing technologies. </p>



<p>A fresh comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts the original game and the RTX Remix modded version running side-by-side, highlighting how the massive visual overhaul comes at a significant performance cost</p>



<p>While the performance difference varies between different scenarios, the hit is always dramatic. In one sequence (at the 1:10 mark), the modded Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT runs at an average of around 30 FPS at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. This is in sharp contrast to the vanilla game, which exceeds 500 FPS on the same RTX 5080 GPU.</p>



<p>The performance hit is similarly massive in another sequence (at 1:29), dropping from the high 500 FPS range down to the 50 FPS range. Once again, it’s clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">current gaming hardware can still not handle full path tracing</a> without heavily relying on upscaling and frame generation to hit playable framerates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Quantic Dream, the studio co-founded by David Cage and known for single-player, story-driven games like Detroit: Become Human, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls, and is currently working on Star Wars: Eclipse, has announced that it is making a competitive multiplayer game.</p>



<p>"<em>For over 28 years, Quantic Dream has been pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling,</em>" co-founder David Cage writes in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">the opening of a blog post on the studio's website</a>, which announced the new competitive multiplayer title, a genre not exactly known for its storytelling.</p>



<p>"<em>After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step. Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been a part of our DNA.</em> <em>We know how demanding it is to create something new. Earning the trust of players, standing out in such a competitive space, and introducing fresh concepts is incredibly challenging. And since we have no legacy in this genre, we know we have everything to prove, which is why your support and feedback will be essential. Together, we believe we can create something truly unique</em>."</p>



<p>The singular mention of Star Wars: Eclipse comes in the following line, where all Cage says is, "<em>Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you</em> <em>in the future</em>." The last update we got for Star Wars: Eclipse before this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/">was in 2023, when the game was "<em>simmering</em>."</a> Since then, it's lead writer, who had been with Quantic Dream for years and led writing on games like Detroit: Become Human, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/">left and formed his own studio</a>.</p>



<p>To call this announcement a "<em>surprise</em>" is a grave understatement, since Quantic Dream is arguably the last studio anyone would expect to make a competitive multiplayer game. It's also a major risk, since we've seen multiple single-player, narrative-game-focused studios try to pivot to multiplayer games before, and failing miserably.</p>







<p>Of course, there's always the chance that the stars align for Cage and Quantic Dream, and whatever competitive multiplayer game they make becomes a huge success. We can always hope for the best outcome, but if the history of studios making a pivot like this can teach us anything, it's that Quantic Dream has a difficult, and more than likely ruinous path ahead of it.</p>
