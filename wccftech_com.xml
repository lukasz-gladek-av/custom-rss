            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom's latest update for Dune: Awakening, Patch 1.1.15.0, adds a few more significant changes to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">PvE parts of the Deep Desert the developer recently added</a>, while also pushing several bug fixes and stability improvements.</p>



<p>While most of these changes will be applied right when you download the update, <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-15-0-patch-notes/">Funcom does warn</a> that some of them will only be applied after scheduled downtime, though it doesn't specify which changes need downtime to be applied. So best to wait until after the next instance of maintenance to expect to see all of these changes.</p>



<p>The most significant change is that tier 6 resources can now be found in the PvE areas of the Deep Desert. Prior to this update, players would have still had to brave the PvP parts of the Deep Desert for the highest tier of resources. You'll still have to head into a PvP area to find a higher density of these resources, but being able to find tier 6 resources in PvE Deep Desert areas rounds out the endgame experience for those solo players and anyone who doesn't want to engage in PvP.</p>



<p>Spawn rates for medium spice fields have also gone back up to 8 after being dropped down to 5 with the update that first added PvE zones to the Deep Desert, and the number of small spice fields has increased from 22 to 30.</p>



<p>Regarding some of the fixes introduced, the most significant fixes are the ones applied to contracts that couldn't be completed, and the issue of players losing out on rewards from completed contracts because their inventory was full. Now, players will receive their rewards for completing contracts only when there is enough space in their inventory for them.</p>



<p>In the weeks since Funcom added PvE areas to the Deep Desert, the response from the player base has been mixed. Some believe Funcom should have never implemented these changes, arguing that having the entirety of the Deep Desert be PvP was tonally correct for a survival game based on Dune. Players who don't want to engage in PvP, however, felt differently, and that even after the tens of hours they spent getting to the endgame, their time with the game was 'cut short' because they could no longer participate in endgame activities without dealing with PvP hazards. </p>



<p>Regardless of where you fall in that argument, Funcom will continue to try and find the right balance between its PvE-focused players and PvP-focused players. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-version-0-10-0-is-now-available-introducing-major-new-feature-for-more-accurate-emulation-of-bloodborne-and-other-game.1237314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing a major new feature that allows for more accurate emulation of multiple games, including FromSoftware's Bloodborne.</p>



<p>The 0.10.0 update, which can be downloaded from the emulator's official website, is packed with a lot of core, libraries, shader recompiler, GPU and GUI improvements, but the biggest improvement, as highlighted in the blog post announcing the release of the new version of the emulator, is the introduction of readbacks, which emulates the shared memory on the PlayStation 4 by reading back memory that was modified on the GPU back to the CPU side, making several games function properly. For example, with this new feature, vertex explosions in Bloodborne and other games should function properly now, as should Trico's climbing ability in The Last Guardian. However, the feature isn't enabled by default, as it is still very experimental and can create issues in games, including performance issues, and, as such, has to be enabled manually via the emulator's config files.</p>



<p>Speaking about The Last Guardian, one of the PlayStation 4 exclusives that still hasn't received an official PC port, the ShadPS4 emulator made some excellent progress emulating the game even before the launch of the new version of the emulator, as showcased in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam</a> which also shows the great progress that's been done in other PS4 exclusives like Driveclub and Killzone Shadow Fall. All three games aren't in a perfect state yet, but the progress is nonetheless impressive, considering the game barely launched on the emulator a few weeks back.</p>

			<p>A new nine-minute clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> gameplay has debuted through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9sqrkte-QQ">IGN</a> that showcases protagonist Enzo embarking on a mission to bring in an enemy of Don Salieri alive.</p>



<p>The mission begins with a short cutscene where Enzo gets the order from Don Salieri himself, presenting Enzo with a chance to prove himself to Salieri and to the rest of the family. Enzo is then escorted to where he can gear up to deal with the "<em>pest problem</em>," which is how the members of the family refer to his assignment. Once he's chosen the proper tools for the job, we get a good look at the Italian countryside while Enzo drives to his target's home.</p>



<p>When he gets there, we get a good look at some stealth combat before all hell breaks loose and Enzo is exchanging bullets with guards, giving us a better look at the third-person gunplay in Mafia: The Old Country. Once he reaches his target, the gameplay fades out before the cutscene finishes, as Enzo knocks his target unconcious.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even with this clip being cut in areas where developer Hangar 13 clearly wanted to keep things hidden, it's still the best look at gameplay we'd had since 2K and Hangar 13 started to properly showcase the game earlier this year.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-has-gone-gold-ahead-of-its-august-release/">Mafia: The Old Country officially went gold last month</a>, ahead of its early-August release date, as Hangar 13 works to polish what it believes will be "<em>the best-looking Mafia game</em>.<em>"</em> We'll see how well it lives up to those expectations, and the rest of the expectations Hangar 13 has set for the game, when it arrives on August 8, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you are someone who cares even a little bit about video game preservation, then you've likely heard of the Stop Killing Games initiative. A consumer-focused movement petition with the goal of gaining enough signatures so that a new law can be proposed to the UK parliament and the European Commission to disallow publishers and developers from making games that can be taken offline and rendered unplayable. </p>



<p>"<em>An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods,</em>" the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games website reads</a>, "<em>with no stated expiration date, but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.</em> <em>This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible</em>."</p>



<p>Stop Killing Games was first started by YouTuber Ross Scott, who took Ubisoft shutting down The Crew as the match with which to light the movement's fire. There's also an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/">ongoing lawsuit over The Crew being shut down</a>, but that is separate from the petition Scott began.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The largest campaign ever to stop publishers destroying games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w70Xc9CStoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Scott began campaigning for signatures, it seemed like his first win came early, when Ubisoft announced it would make <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">offline versions of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest</a> available for players. It's unclear if the pressure from Stop Killing Games is what led to the decision, but it's difficult to imagine it wasn't a part of the conversation. However, no one (at least not video game publishers) suspected Stop Killing Games would gain enough traction to actually put pressure on the industry's largest publishers and developers. That was, until Scott announced that the petition had surpassed 1 million signatures.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The site says we have cleared 1 million signatures!  I hate being like this, but there's a chance a significant number of them aren't real.  That means we have to keep signing in overdrive mode to make up for them!  I'll have a video on this later today.<a href="https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U">https://t.co/EpnNTDR85U</a></p>— Accursed Farms (@accursedfarms) <a href="https://twitter.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Even with Scott warning that many of the signatures could be faked, and encouraging anyone who hasn't yet to still sign the petition, that milestone and the signs that Stop Killing Games was going to get its shot at having legislation proposed to prohibit video game makers from creating online-only games that can be shut down forever in a moment was enough for video game publishers and developers to collectively respond to the movement. </p>



<p>Video Games Europe, a collective body that represents the European divisions of the largest publishers and developers in the video game industry, and <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/about/our-board/">whose board is comprised of leaders from</a> Roblox, Warner Bros, Epic Games, EA, Activision, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Take-Two, and more, released a statement that was, unsurprisingly, in opposition to Stop Killing Games, claiming that if laws like the ones it is suggesting are passed, making online-focused games would become "<em>prohibitively expensive</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We appreciate the passion of our community;"</em> the <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">statement from Video Games Europe</a> began. "<em>However, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We understand that it can be disappointing for players, but when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws. Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create. We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months</em>."</p>



<p>Scott has published a response to the Video Games Europe statement, immediately pointing to the fact that Stop Killing Games isn't looking to make it impossible for publishers to discontinue their online games. "<em>We are in no way seeking to impede your</em> <em>right to discontinue online services,</em>" Scott says. "<em>We are saying you can shut down your games whenever you want, but you have to do that responsibly, in a way that doesn't take back rights you already sold to customers</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even after a year of campaigning, it is still too early to tell if Stop Killing Games will actually have any impact. The deadline for the petition to be submitted for review is soon approaching, and even after that step, legislation still has to be passed. There are still plenty of opportunities for it to die on the rack. Still, it is clear that Scott has pushed the issue far enough to the point where it could make an impact. </p>
