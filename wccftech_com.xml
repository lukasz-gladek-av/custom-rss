			<p>Today, Build A Rocket Boy and IO Partners announced the launch date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creators-mindseye-game-slated-to-launch-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindsEye</a>. The upcoming single-player narrative-driven action/adventure game will be released on June 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders for digital and physical editions are now open at $59.99 / €59.99 / £54.99. Interestingly, there's only one edition for the time being; every pre-order automatically gets a free upgrade to the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Premium Pass, the Deluxe Thorn &amp; Kepler Yellowjacket Weapon, the Future Jacob Vest Skin, the Future DC2 Companion Drone Skin, and the Future Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin.</p>
<p>The Premium Pass includes the following in-game items:</p>
<p>• Pack 1 "Exotic Pack" ("Exotic" Jacob Vest Skin, "Exotic" DC2 Companion Drone Skin, "Exotic" Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin)</p>
<p>• Horde Mode Mission: Face a variety of enemies with distinct tactics and behaviors. Think fast and use your surroundings to outmaneuver your opponents.</p>
<p>• Pack 2: Extra missions and challenges in Q3 2025</p>
<p>• Pack 3: Extra missions and challenges in Q4 2025</p>
<p>• Pack 4: Extra missions and challenges in Q1 2026</p>
<p>MindsEye owners will also get access to bonus missions built in ARCADIA, Build A Rocket Boy’s custom building and distribution tool that enables rapid creation of AAA content. This was previously known as Everywhere; indeed, MindsEye was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> two years ago as a side experience to this project. However, it quickly became its own separate game and took over the spotlight.</p>
<p>Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye and former producer of every GTA game from III to V, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences unravel.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Welcome to Redrock - Official Story Trailer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oprmuMXtfAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The news was accompanied by a new story trailer that provides a glimpse of technology's immersive influence on Redrock, where consumer robots perform most manual tasks, and an algorithm connects all-seeing devices. The city itself is a living experiment in the existential potential of man and machine. We also see a few dialogues between the main characters.</p>
<p>In MindsEye, players take the role of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier fitted with the titular neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Jacob must uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unbridled military power shape every encounter. However, Jacob won't be the only one searching for answers, and the forces operating in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. The developers say players should prepare for intense combat - on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air - where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat.</p>
