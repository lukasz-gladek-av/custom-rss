			<p>Archetype Entertainment has finally shared the first gameplay trailer for its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EXODUS</a>, and it's fair to say it's very reminiscent of Mass Effect. Not that we were expecting anything much different from a studio founded by key BioWare veterans like Creative Director James Ohlen and Lead Writer Drew Karpyshyn.</p>
<p>In the trailer, we saw several brief dialogues between protagonist Juno and some of their companions, not to mention shooting, a grappling hook used in a fight with an armored bear, and even stealth (which was largely absent from Mass Effect). The trailer debuted on a stream hosted by CohhCarnage, where Ohlen and Archetype General Manager Chad Robertson answered several questions about the game.</p>
<p>EXODUS won't be an open world game, focusing on curated missions like in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic or Mass Effect instead. That said, there'll be room for exploration and optional content.</p>
<p>Described as an action roleplaying game, it will feature a lot of choices for players, the main twist being that they will get to see them impact their own homeworld over the decades and even centuries. The central theme of the game is that Travelers like Juno embark on perilous journeys to distant planets in a desperate effort to recover long-lost technology that could help humanity fight off the Celestials.</p>
<p>In that regard, Ohlen described Juno (who can be a male or female depending on the player's preference) as a blend of Indiana Jones and Dune's Paul Atreides. On one hand, they are explorers who venture into forgotten crypts and lost worlds to uncover precious artifacts; on the other hand, they are also leaders of their civilization, making pivotal choices for the development of humankind.</p>
<p>The aforementioned journeys are conducted at near-lightspeed. As a result, while the trips may take days or weeks for Juno and their team (by the way, they can only take two with them at a time, like in Mass Effect), years or even decades may have passed for those back on the home planet, which should result in some interesting plot progression.</p>

<p>As you would expect in a game made by BioWare vets, EXODUS will feature deep relationships with the player character's companions, some of which will be romanceable. There may well be infighting between them, too, and it will be up to Juno to deal with the potential fallout.</p>
<p>We also got some info on the so-called lifestone, a blend of mineral and live vegetation that Juno can take advantage of while in combat and in exploration. It certainly sounds like this game's version of magic-like powers.</p>
<p>EXODUS is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-aaa-rpg-will-be-co-developed-by-certain-affinity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-developed</a> with the help of Certain Affinity and will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. No date was provided, but the developers teased that it won't be long before we get to see more gameplay. Meanwhile, you can either read the novel <a href="https://amzn.to/4gixKn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> earlier this year or watch the dedicated 15-minute episode of Blur Studio's Secret Level that just became available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is projected to sell between 15 and 17 million units next year and more than 80 million units by 2028, solidifying its position as the console market leader, while Sony and Microsoft will struggle to gain significant market share with their next-generation systems.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DFC Intelligence</a>, the longest-standing research and advisory firm focused exclusively on the video game industry, published its 20245 market report and forecast, projecting major revenue growth for the video game industry for the second half of the decade. Following two years of revenue drop, the market will grow from this year's US$72 billion to US$83 billion in 2028, reaching nearly a third of a trillion dollars by then factoring in PC and console hardware and mobile game revenues. The video game audience is also expected to grow considerably, and nearly half the world is expected to be playing video games by 2027.</p>

<p>In the midst of this projected growth, Nintendo is expected to emerge as the absolute winner of the next console generation with the Nintendo Switch 2 in terms of hardware sales. According to DFC Intelligence, the system will be the most popular next-generation console, thanks to a combination of earlier availability and limited competition. As such, Nintendo's next system is expected to sell between 15 and 17 million units next year and over 80 million units by 2028. The PlayStation 6 and Xbox Next, on the other hand, are expected to fail to significantly increase Sony and Microsoft's market share, and one of the two companies will struggle in a distant third place, depending on which of the two can gain early momentum.</p>

<p>Given how much the Nintendo Switch 2 is being talked about despite the system still having to be officially revealed, these sales projections should surprise no one. The excitement surrounding the system could reach new heights as the new year begins, as Nintendo is reportedly planning not to wait <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/">much longer</a> to finally provide the first proper look at its next-generation system.</p>
