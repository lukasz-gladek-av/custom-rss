			<p>The Halloween season has come back around, and players will be able to experience the Tower Raid once more, but with a Halloween twist. In Dying Light 2, players will be able to experience the Tower Raid: Halloween Run event, where there are new levels, weapons, rewards, and a very festive final boss fight for those who manage to climb to the top. For those who want to take part in the event, the Dying Light 2 Tower Raid: Halloween Run will last from October 30 to November 20. This event is available for players right after the prologue, meaning those who are new to the game will be able to get stuck in without having to sit through a ton of missions first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light 2: Stay Human — Tower Raid: Halloween Run" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FC56Q9bG_yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The event offers plenty of new rewards, new candies, and the return of Baka, who will be waiting at the Bazaar, offering bounties for you to complete. To celebrate the release of Tower Raid: Halloween Run in Dying Light 2, a trailer has been released. This event will also feature new content for each week that it's available.</p>
<p>For the first week of the event in Dying Light 2, players will be able to get to grips with the new progression system that has been designed specifically for this event, as well as getting their hands on some of the rewards up for grabs. By the second week, players will be able to increase the difficulty level as Elite Mode makes a return to the event, as well as exclusive bounties to participate in. For the third week, you'll be able to unlock daily bounties, which will help contribute to getting your hands on rewards.</p>
<p>As this is a separate event version of Tower Raid, there will be eight floors in total to work through, with a themed boss at the top. Some of the floors are entirely new to the game, with all of them being decorated to fit in with the Halloween theme. To celebrate the festive season, there is also a brand new character system where players will be able to select a role from four options that are available. They each have unique loadouts and traits. The characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarecrow - Two-handed scythe wielder and increased HP pool</li>
<li>Plague - Increased melee damage and stamina with a Plague Cane that utilizes the buffs</li>
<li>Van Aiden - Crossbow and increased ranged damage</li>
<li>Cursed Pirate - Cutlass-wielder with parkour damage perks</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Halloween update, there is a new patch released for Dying Light 2, which adds a bunch of fixes and quality-of-life improvements, as well as new weapons for players to obtain. There will also be a new firearm control layout, which can be activated in the control system. It's been confirmed that there will be future updates to work on making this game a smoother, enhanced experience for the players.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who prefer to find out the patch notes and major updates added to a game via a video format, the development team has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psA1Uq6aWyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying 2 Know More</a>, which talks about the Halloween event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/">future plans for the game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're only a day away from the official launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Following the early critic reviews and initial industry <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-high-praise-from-larians-director-of-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressions</a>, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson shared the company's excitement about the game's sales potential. Speaking to investors during the Q2 2025 earnings call (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/electronic-arts-ea-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcribed</a> by The Motley Fool), he said:</p>
<p><em>It's an amazing time at EA, and in two days, we will launch Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It's been ten years since we launched its predecessor, Game of the Year winner Dragon Age: Inquisition. Early critic scores are strong and reflect the high quality, depth, and detail in this year's action-packed adventure. We expect Dragon Age to be a great example of how our blockbuster storytelling engages and connects fans in truly unique ways.</em></p>
<p><em>I certainly think Veilguard has breakout potential. Again, 10 years ago, Dragon Age: Inquisition was Game of the Year and a very strong performer for us. This is entertainment. While much of our business has moved to live service, this opportunity to bring in incredibly high-quality, creative storytelling set in an amazing world with rich characters living out those stories, you are able to capture that moment in entertainment and success almost certainly follows. We see that in the context of movies, TV seasons, and videogames. When we think about what we have with Veilguard right now, we have a storied studio in BioWare and a storied IP in Dragon Age.</em></p>
<p><em>We have a team that took extra time to make sure the world was rich and the characters were interesting and the story was compelling. I think we're going into a market that has limited competition for this category of game given some of the moves that have happened across the broader industry. While I think it's too early to predict the outcome, the critical reviews have been incredibly strong. The team feels really energized by what they have delivered, and my sense is that yes, it has breakout capabilities.</em></p>
<p>We recently learned from Executive Producer Mark Darrah that Dragon Age: Inquisition sold 12 million units lifetime, becoming BioWare's best-selling game. We'll have to see whether Veilguard can achieve similar success, but EA certainly is confident based on pre-orders and critical reception.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved my time with the game, as you can read in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>If the game sells well, there's a chance we might get some DLC, a topic on which BioWare hasn't commented at all so far. The DLCs made for Inquisition, Trespasser specifically, were some of the best content released for the previous game, so here's hoping.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio's next big project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next Mass Effect</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-video-highlights-minimal-visual-improvements-over-console-versions-rtx-4070-can-run-the-game-at-8k-resolution.1023036/</guid>

			<p>A new Red Dead Redemption comparison shared online a few hours ago highlights the differences between the PC and console versions of Rockstar Games' glorious open-world game, which finally made its debut on PC 14 years after its original release.</p>
<p>The comparison put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@geracaopowerup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geração Power Up</a> puts the PC version of the game side by side with the Switch and the Xbox 360 versions of the game, highlighting how the biggest improvement is the higher resolution, which returns a sharp image quality over the other versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption - Graphics Comparison (PC, X360 &amp; SWITCH) | 4K ULTRA HD" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qQqnp3l8hE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption being essentially the same on PC as it is on consoles, at the very least, ensures it runs well on a variety of system configurations. An RTX 4070 GPU, for example, is capable of running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS at playable framerates, as highlighted in a new video by MxBenchmarkPC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption PC | RTX 4070 8K, 4K, 1440p DLSS 3.7 Frame Generation | PC Performance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rjk6a9CTrEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To see proper visual improvements in Red Dead Redemption PC, we will have to wait for mods. A stunning visual overhaul called <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reality Redemption</a> will soon be released for the new version of the game, bringing improvements such as better reflection quality, draw distance for vegetation and map, particles and particle count, and more.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>
