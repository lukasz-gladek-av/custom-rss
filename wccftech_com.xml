			<p>While many didn't know what was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-new-project-state-of-play/">in store</a> for the State of Play, some had <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-teased-on-base-games-anniversary/">some guesses</a> as to what may be announced, with Lies of P's DLC being at the forefront. Unfortunately, Bloodborne remastered wasn't announced, despite many feeling it was confirmed with the DMCA takedowns of the 60fps mod and the Bloodborne Demake. However, we do have the next best thing, which is new Lies of P content. Showcased during today's State of Play, the Lies of P DLC was announced, with the title Overture. You can check out the trailer for Lies of P Overture down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P: Overture - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfS9uc-CTcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lies of P fans knew it was coming, as the DLC was announced shortly after the release of the game, which received positive reviews on all platforms. It's been nearly two years since the base game originally launched, and now we get to see Pinocchio come back, looking more fashionable than ever.</p>
<p>The DLC will take players back to the beginning of the Puppet Frenzy, the event that led to the destruction of Krat, which you experience in the base game. Players will then get to go on a journey through time to piece together the story of the past, present, and future of Lies of P, while being introduced to new locations and getting to experience new, thrilling boss fights.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting features of Lies of P was the wide variety of costumes and weapons you could experiment with, combining the typical "fashion souls" experience with combat that was suited to your playstyle. With Lies of P Overture, players will get to experiment with more new outfits, and more new weapons. The DLC will allow players to craft new weapons and experiment with a new combat style, as well as try out new Legion Arms.</p>
<p>The DLC doesn't have a set release date just yet, but it has been confirmed by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lies-of-p-overture-launches-summer-2025-on-ps5-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the developers</a> that the Lies of P prequel DLC will be making its way onto PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro this summer. Whether this means it's tied exclusively to those consoles for a certain amount of time or whether the DLC will be released on console and PC remains to be seen. However, considering there was no mention of PC or even Xbox at this point, it does provide a little bit of anxiety that Lies of P fans won't be able to experience it at the same time as PlayStation users.</p>
