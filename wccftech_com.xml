			<p>A report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">The Wall Street Journal</a> reveals that EA is closing in on a deal to become a private company, with private equity investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the firm Silver Lake putting up a massive $50 billion to buy out the company. According to The WSJ, if this buyout were to go through, it would go down as the "<em>largest leveraged buyout ever.</em>"</p>



<p>Details on the deal are currently unclear, and of course, we don't necessarily know if it'll go through or not. Large-stakes deals involving Saudi Arabia and its growing interests in the videogame industry have <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/">gone under at the last minute for what remain unknown reasons</a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the first time that we've seen the idea of EA changing in ownership getting tossed around, as there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-gaming-giant-buy-ea-iger-noncommital/">reports of Disney potentially looking at acquiring EA in 2023</a>, though nothing ever came of the idea in part due to chief executive officer Bob Iger not wanting to invest so much in that direction. </p>



<p>Still, if this deal that the WSJ has reported goes through and EA becomes a private company, it could potentially mean a massive shift for one of the videogame industry's largest publishers and developers. Since the WSJ's report broke, EA's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/electronic-arts-buyout.html">stock has reportedly jumped up 15%</a>.</p>
