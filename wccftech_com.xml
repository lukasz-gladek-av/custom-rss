			<p>Elden Ring developer FromSoftware is currently not considering creating a sequel for their highly successful game, but this doesn't mean that the series won't be expanded in the future for certain.</p>
<p>During today's PlayStation Partner Awards, Japanese publication <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1644616.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameWatch</a> talked with FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki about what's next for the development studio after the release of the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. At the moment, the studio is not considering the development of a second entry in the series, but this doesn't mean that a sequel will never be made. For the time being, FromSoftware is working on multiple projects covering different genres, some of them under the direction of Miyazaki-san himself, which will show some different sides of the Japanese development studio.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's latest release is the aforementioned Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, which launched earlier this year on PC and consoles. The expansion is every bit as good as the base game, featuring the same mechanics and open-world setting that made The Lands Between so memorable, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>

			<p>With The Witcher 4, developer CD Projekt Red may fix the known stuttering issues that plague Unreal Engine 5 games by changing how things are done in the engine, but not all improvements may be implemented in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> replied to a fan asking if CDPR will fix the aforementioned Unreal Engine 5 stuttering issues in The Witcher 4, delving deeper into a topic that was briefly touched upon a few months back. The tech experts highlighted how the developer has made it known they are well aware of them in a presentation held earlier this year during Unreal Fest Prague conducted by Jarosław Rudzki titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaCf2Qmvy18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Small Open Doors Can Lead to Better CPU Utilization and Bigger Games.</a> The presentation was centered on the Polish studio's findings from their own games and in Unreal Engine 5 regarding how frame times get worse by moving around in a game, and the bigger the world, and the more actors get involved in the game's world, the worse frame times get. As such, it is suggested that things must be done differently in Unreal Engine 5 than ever before to reduce the well-known frame time issues seen so far, such as changing how streaming is handled and more. Judging from this presentation, it is very likely that CDPR will do things differently in The Witcher 4 to address these issues and deliver a smooth open-world experience.</p>
<p>CDPR solving the Unreal Engine 5 stuttering issues for The Witcher 4, however, doesn't mean that all games powered by the engine will instantly benefit from the improvements made by the Polish Studio. Some of them, for example, could be game-specific, while others may take some time to get implemented in the engine itself, despite the partnership between CDPR and Epic. For example, there's a well-known issue with software Lumen in games like Fortnite that prevents it from being enabled in AMD APUs, such as those powering handheld systems like the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally, that has yet to be officially fixed. So, there's a very good chance it will still be mostly up to the developers to address these issues that are affecting the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5-powered games.</p>

<p>Some time since its initial reveal, The Witcher 4 has finally entered <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/">full production</a>. A release window has yet to be confirmed, but hopefully, it won't take long to learn more about the first entry in the series that will not feature Geralt of Rivia as the main character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-launches-on-game-pass-tomorrow/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1863659427452129292" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled will debut on Game Pass tomorrow. The slow drip feed of Activision Blizzard games on Game Pass continues. It all started with Diablo IV, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> Microsoft's subscription service on March 28. Then, it was time for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaped</a> on GP starting July 24, and Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy followed suit on August 8. The new Call of Duty, Black Ops 6, joined Game Pass from day one on October 25, the first in the franchise to do so. Then, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/spyro-reignited-trilogy-flies-to-game-pass-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought</a> Spyro Reignited Trilogy to GP on November 12.</p>
<p>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled was originally released in July 2019, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning</a> a 7.5 score on Wccftech from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is that beautiful vintage ride that’s great for short joyrides, but maybe not a long road trip. It&nbsp;doesn’t break any new ground, but the 20-year-old game at the heart of the package holds up well and Beenox has done a commendable job of updating it for the 21st century. Unfortunately, most of the extras that have been added, including Crash Nitro Kart tracks and the usual pile of unlockable cosmetics, aren’t terribly inspired, making Nitro-Fueled feel less essential than other recent Activision remakes. Hardcore CTR fans and those looking for a surprisingly-stiff challenge should give Nitro-Fueled a shot, but others might find it runs out of gas surprisingly quick.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game is still only available on consoles for some reason, and this will apply to this Game Pass launch, too. PC subscribers won't see it appear in their libraries simply because there is no PC version available. The announcement post on X was filled with many comments asking for a port, but at this point, it seems highly unlikely for a mildly successful game from five and a half years ago.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-case-possibly-leaked-through-alibaba.1050432/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-case-possibly-leaked-through-alibaba/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another day, another Nintendo Switch 2 leak. Yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a leak of the first alleged pictures of the console's new controller. Today, pictures of a Nintendo Switch 2 case and a tempered glass screen protector were uploaded on Alibaba, the massive Chinese e-commerce website, and Reddit users immediately <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1h5j5oq/tempered_glass_and_switch_2_case_appears_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked</a> them up.</p>
<p>It's hard to say if they're real, of course, but the frequency of the leaks hints that the product is getting into more hands. This, in turn, makes us hopeful that Nintendo will finally say something about the console very soon. It's been years since the first rumors started, and customers (and even us journalists) are frankly a bit tired of all this wait.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Japanese corporation has promised to unveil the new hardware (which we are confidentially calling the Switch 2 but hasn't been officially named yet) before the end of their fiscal year, which translates to March 2025. That would also mark the eighth year after the launch of the original Switch.</p>
<p>Let's quickly recap what we know about the Nintendo Switch 2. The hardware is supposed to be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's Tegra T239</a>, which combines an Ampere-powered GPU featuring 1280 CUDA Cores and an 8-core ARM Cortex A78 CPU. There will be 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM, split in two modules of 6GB each, and 256GB of storage space. For the RAM, there would be a 3x increase compared to the Switch, while the storage space would be eight times larger than the original Switch and four compared to the OLED revision.</p>
<p>NVIDIA's chipset will reportedly include built-in support for NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) Super Resolution and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Reconstruction</a>, the latter indirectly confirming ray tracing support. However, Frame Generation isn't expected to be supported.</p>
<p>On paper, the Nintendo Switch 2 should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even less powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, which is the weakest console of the current generation. However, its games can be tailored for the specific hardware, so it could very well punch above its weight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shown-in-new-43-minute-long-gameplay-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is the game featured in December's IGN First, so fans of the upcoming first-person open world action roleplaying game can look forward to new content and reveals throughout the whole month. To start with, IGN posted the first 43 minutes of gameplay, which were taken from the PC version of the game. You can watch them in the embed below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is still based on Crytek's CryENGINE technology rather than switching to the far more popular Unreal Engine by Epic Games. During <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 chat with Martin Klima</a>, we asked him why. Here's what he had to say on the subject:</p>
<p><em>When we finished KCD, we took a look at the technology we were using and were considering our options, but we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs and I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay - The First 43 Minutes | IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6GXG1HD6bg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhorse Studios still hasn't shared the game's system requirements. However, they did share that the game can run smoothly even on relatively low-end machines, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-runs-buttery-smooth-on-rtx-3050-wont-have-denuvo-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling in the first official Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 live stream:</p>
<p><em>We learned from what we did in KCD. We took way more time than in the first game for bug fixing, optimization, performance testing, and so on. We are working on this right now and not only on PC but also on consoles for the console players, so there's good news for everyone. Give us a tiny little bit more time, but I think by the end of the year, we should be able to tell you exactly what you should get. I personally at home play on a 3050 GPU I think, and it runs buttery smooth. As I said, give us some time on performance testing, and we will tell you soon.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is slated to release on February 11 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
