			<p>The Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games will not integrate DEI elements in their games to maximize player enjoyment and commercial success after having observed the high commercial risk these elements can present.</p>
<p>During a recent <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/czaty-inwestorskie/20250108/ci-games-marek-tyminski">investor chat</a>, the studio was asked about their stance on DEI in gaming. Global Marketing Director Ryan Hill confirmed that the studio remains committed to producing player-first video games that prioritize excellent user experience with compelling themes and characters created specifically for <em>"core and adjacent audiences"</em>. While some recent video games have taken the opportunity to implement <em>"social and political agendas"</em> within their experiences, Hill continued, the lower than expected commercial performance of some of these games shows that many players do not appreciate these elements. As such, the studio will continue to develop experiences that maximize player enjoyment and commercial success.</p>
<p>In the same investor chat, Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games talked about what's <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/">next for the game and the franchise as a whole</a>, confirming the game released in 2023 will continue to receive updates up to version 2.0. Development of the sequel is also proceeding, and extensive play testing will be conducted in 2025.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game, which has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-update-1-7-improves-combat-fluidity-adds-npc-summons/">improved</a> quite a bit since its release, in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Lords of the Fallen boasts impressive visuals and an interesting story for a soulslike, but unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. Despite functional gameplay and a well-designed world, the experience is marred by frustrating combat mechanics, subpar enemy placement, and an overall lack of polish, making it one of the most frustrating soulslikes ever released.</em></p>

			<p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will be among the Xbox games that will launch on other platforms in the near future, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during a recent podcast, well-known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a> talked about the Xbox games that will launch this year on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the obvious, the insider confirmed he heard that Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will launch on the other systems this year. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">yet-to-be-announced Oblivion remake, </a>which is supposedly launching this June, will be another game launching on consoles other than Xbox systems, although this is more speculation than an actual rumor based on the fact that there is no reason for the game not to be a multiplatform release. At the same time, the "loss" of two exclusives will be compensated with the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, which will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively, not only on Xbox consoles but also on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox 2025 Predictions: Gears E-Day in 2025, FF7 Remake, BIG Switch 2 &amp; PS5 Games, Oblivion &amp; More" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIhoTirZxlk?start=3220&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 probably won't have much trouble running the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, it will be very interesting to see how the much more demanding Flight Simulator will run on the next Nintendo system. If recent rumors are any indication, these ports may be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">scaled-down versions of the Xbox Series S versions</a>, which would make sense considering the system is currently the less powerful current generation console.</p>
<p>The launch of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 would be a landmark moment for Microsoft, further highlighting the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-xbox-fans-are-being-redefined-into-enjoying-games-on-all-their-devices-i-feel-very-good-about-the-gaming-division/">shift in strategy. </a>Hopefully, it won't take much longer to know if PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo Switch 2 owners will be able to experience the first few entries in the series on their platform of choice.</p>
