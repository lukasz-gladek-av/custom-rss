			<p>On September 6, 2018, South Korean game developer Pearl Abyss (Black Desert) <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> CCP Games and the MMORPG EVE Online, the flagship product of the Icelandic studio, for around $425 million.</p>
<p>Nearly seven years later, Pearl Abyss might be reconsidering their stake in CCP Games. At least, that's what <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report by Korean website MTN</a> alleges today: PA has reportedly reached out to multiple game companies to gauge their potential interest in acquiring CCP Games.</p>
<p>We don't have public visibility on the sales performance of CCP's games, but we do know that there were several missteps along the way, both prior and after the acquisition by Pearl Abyss. Over its nearly thirty-year history, CCP canceled at least four games (an MMO set in the World of Darkness, Project Legion, Eve: The Second Genesis, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Nova</a>), while other projects notoriously fizzled too early, such as Dust 514. For a while, CCP even released several Virtual Reality games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/196685-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE: Valkyrie</a>, Gunjack, Gunjack 2: End of Shift, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sparc-virtual-sport-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparc</a>), although eventually it gave up once it became crystal clear that the VR market was too small.</p>
<p>More recently, CCP <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-frontier-goes-public-today-with-founder-access-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> EVE: Frontier, a survival spin-off of EVE Online, in 'Founder Access'. Perhaps Pearl Abyss isn't thrilled with the direction of Frontier and the other new project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-frontier-vanguard-fanfest-2025-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a>, CCP's umpteenth at a shooter game connected with its MMORPG.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the MTN report alleges that the Korean company would be glad to be rid of this subsidiary and focus on its own games, such as Crimson Desert and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DokeV</a>. This is the same source that <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a tentative internal release date for Crimson Desert, by the way, to which Pearl Abyss only referred back to official announcements coming from its own social channels.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we'll update this article if PA chooses to comment in any way. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-nvidia-dlss-4-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Battlefield Labs update has gone live today, introducing new features to the test version of what will presumably be the next entry in the popular first-person shooter series.</p>
<p>As reported on the franchise's official subreddit, the new patch that went live a few hours ago introduced a few changes and improvements, such as NVIDIA DLSS 4 support and the option to turn off the border around the capture zone. Additionally, the new update has changed the watermark from PRE ALPHA to ALPHA and has added files related to a battle royale mode. With the promise of news coming soon regarding the class system, there's the chance the update has been pushed in preparation for something, possibly the official announcement of the next Battlefield which is still scheduled for this <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">summer.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lf7tkr/new_information_dropped_from_the_1bf_telegram/">New information dropped from the 1BF telegram</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NSGXD/">u/NSGXD</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">Battlefield</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although Battlefield Labs footage was not meant to be shared, plenty of it has made its way <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-new-leaked-footage/">online,</a> providing an early look at what the next entry in the series should offer. Besides the multiplayer modes that select users can test right now, the next entry in the series will also feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/">single-player campaign</a> developed by Motive Studios, the team behind last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/">Dead Space remake</a>, which will be influenced by TV shows and movies like Lioness and Civil War.</p>
<p>More information on Battlefield Labs can be found on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-has-just-become-more-challenging-with-the-introduction-of-the-everdark-sovereigns/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has just become more challenging, thanks to the introduction of a more powerful variant of the Nightlords.</p>
<p>Following the release of the game's latest minor update mainly focused on fixing bugs, Nightfarers will now encounter <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everdark Sovereigns</a> during Expeditions. Over the next few weeks, they can take on more powerful variants of the Gaping Jaw, Sentient Pest, and Darkdrift Knight bosses, with other Everdark Sovereigns getting added to the game later. Every week, a new Sovereign will arrive in Limveld for everyone who has already defeated the base version of the boss, and when the time is up, they will disappear. Those who manage to take down these limited-time versions of the Nightlords will be rewarded with Sovereign Sigils that can be exchanged for special Relics and other items. The first Everdark Sovereign, an enhanced version of Adel, Baron of the Night, will be available until June 26 9:59 JST 2:59 CEST 5:59 PM PDT.</p>
<p>Considering there isn't much to do in Elden Ring Nightreign after defeating the game's final boss, the introduction of more powerful Nightlords is more than welcome. Not that the game needed more challenge, as some of the base Nightlords are among the most challenging bosses created by FromSoftware, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-introducing-stability-improvements-and-more.1222908/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-update-20-1-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is now live, introducing general stability improvements as well as undocumented improvements.</p>
<p>The official update notes don't leave any doubt regarding the fact that this is a minor update, as it only introduces <em>"general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience."</em> What's more interesting is that the update reportedly does introduce some undocumented improvements. As reported by well-known dataminer OatmealDome on <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the new update improves backward compatibility, and some previously unsupported titles are now properly playable on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While not a direct effect of the new system update, Pikmin 3 Deluxe now properly works on the new system, thanks to a new <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935510351015006422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> that addressed screen flickering issues. The demo version of the game will also be fixed later.</p>
<p>Backward compatibility seems to be one of the best features of the Nintendo Switch 2, so it wouldn't be surprising to see improvements already being made so soon. Multiple tests have confirmed that even<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/"> unpatched games</a> can take advantage of the new system's better specs to deliver more stable framerates, so hopefully, more of the incompatible titles will become fully playable on the system in the future.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a massive improvement over its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lionhearts-a-persistent-multiplayer-feudal-simulator-seeks-funding-on-kickstarter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new game project titled Lionhearts <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/612741239/lionhearts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared on Kickstarter</a> yesterday, seeking a minimum of $100K, of which over half has already been pledged. ROBLOX fans might recognize the name from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/1160789" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts: Crusade</a>, a conquest experience developed by Credenzio Studios that reached over 6.3 million plays in the popular game since its original release in 2018.</p>
<p>Now, Colorado-based developer Credenzio is turning the concept into a standalone game developed with Unreal Engine 5. It will be a persistent multiplayer feudal simulator inspired by games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount and Blade: Bannerlord</a>, Assassin's Creed, Helldivers, and EVE Online.</p>
<p>The game is set in a historically authentic 12th-century medieval world, specifically during the Third Crusade. The developers pledged to respect the bounds of historical plausibility and accuracy. In this context, players will be given nearly complete reign, with NPCs having little to no presence in the game world. They'll start with having to gain favor in their kingdom to ascend the religious, military, or trade hierarchies and acquire wealth, tools, lands, and power. To do so, they'll choose one of the three career paths of the age: military, religious, or trade. With 16 factions, 14 guild types offering 60+ career paths, and 4 religions, players can become a knight, blacksmith, bishop, merchant, or even a king, eventually ruling the Holy Land itself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lionhearts Official Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEj2d-uBhEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Lionhearts, there will be 12 player-run kingdoms and 4 military orders, in which every position of power, from lord to king, is controlled by real players. Players can command retinues, wage wars, and navigate diplomacy in an ever-changing struggle for land and influence. Monarchs must balance internal politics, trade, and religion while competing for dominance in the Holy Land and beyond. As mentioned earlier, Credenzio is promising a persistent MMO-like world. This is supposed to happen through a server meshing-like technology where servers are stitched together to create a single, seamless shared open world. Each location will exist in a single instance, so there will be no need for server hopping or loading screens.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Lordship of Belmont Lionhearts Demo" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnhlOcNb7F0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, it's an incredibly ambitious project, especially for an indie studio. There is, however, a 'visual demo' available for download (the link is on the Kickstarter page) for those interested. Otherwise, you could simply add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3348690/Lionhearts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts</a> to your Steam wishlist.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mario-kart-world-was-made-with-a-much-larger-workforce.1222818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-was-made-with-a-much-larger-workforce/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's no doubt that Mario Kart World is the most important launch game for the Nintendo Switch 2. Not only is it the only new game (no, the Welcome Tour definitely doesn't count) made by Nintendo for the launch lineup, it's also the sequel to one of the best-selling games ever. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, at last count, has sold nearly 70 million units on the original Switch.</p>
<p>Whether Mario Kart World can match it with similar success remains to be seen over a long period of time. Still, the early reception is promising. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game earned an 8.5 out of 10 score from Nathan Birch, who wrote:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em></p>
<p>Making the new open world-style game required a much larger workforce, though. Japanese analyst Papen (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mario-kart-world-had-a-significantly-larger-dev-team-than-past-entries-with-art-related-positions-increasing-threefold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Automaton</a>) has looked into the headcount, discovering that around 300 developers worked on Mario Kart World, compared to 163 on MK8 Deluxe. That shows how Nintendo is following the market trend in this regard, with larger and inevitably more expensive teams making bigger games.</p>
<p>The biggest increase was in the art department, which tripled in size from one game to another. Furthermore, like most of the gaming industry nowadays, Nintendo leveraged several development teams beyond Nintendo EPD, such as Monolith Soft, Bandai Namco, Imagica Geeq, and 1-Up Studio. This could go some way to explaining why Mario Kart World was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infamously priced at $80</a>.</p>
<p>Did you purchase the game alongside the Nintendo Switch 2? If so, please comment below with your impressions.</p>
