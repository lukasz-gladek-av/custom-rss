			<p>CD Projekt RED reported its latest financial results today with its <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf">third-quarter 2025 earnings report</a>. The report included a couple of notable updates on the studio's ongoing projects and a significant update about the studio's most infamous release, Cyberpunk 2077. </p>



<p>After what no one will deny was an absolutely disastrous launch, true to its word and commitment to try and right its wrongs, CD Projekt RED has overhauled and patched Cyberpunk 2077 to the point where the game has now sold <strong>35 million copies</strong> since it launched in December 2020. </p>

<p>This announcement comes almost exactly a year to the day after CD Projekt RED announced Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/">had reached 30 million copies sold</a>. </p>



<p>No one will soon forget how, in 2020, CD Projekt RED withheld PS4 and Xbox One copies of Cyberpunk 2077 from reviewers ahead of launch, only handing out PC copies pre-release in an attempt to mask how poorly it ran on those previous-gen consoles and protect its pre-orders, and the backlash that followed. </p>



<p>That said, now that we're almost five years out from that disaster, even though it took CD Projekt RED three years to release the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-release-date/">Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 patch</a>, we're arguably at the point where we can say CD Projekt RED has earned the ability not to be forever judged for Cyberpunk 2077's 2020 launch.</p>

<p>Though the real test of whether players can really trust CD Projekt RED again will come with the release of its next major title, The Witcher 4. Its launch will likely be the difference maker between whether players entirely abandon CDPR or start to really trust the developer again.</p>



<p>Speaking of The Witcher 4, work on the return of CDPR's other major franchise has continued to be the company's main focus, with 447 developers all working on it. Meanwhile, the percentage of developers working on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel continues to scale up, with 135 developers now spread out between the studio's Vancouver, Warsaw, and Boston branches, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-do-better-justice-to-its-settings-americana-thanks-to-the-new-boston-studio-says-cdpr/">the latter of which was opened specifically to work on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>.</p>



<p>Once The Witcher 4 is out the door, we can expect to see more of the company move to working on Project Orion, which is the given code name for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, which CDPR has also begun calling "<em>Cyberpunk 2</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>We are very happy and satisfied with the fact that - despite the passage of time - Cyberpunk 2077 remains such a well performing title and continues to attract new players</em>," said Michał Nowakowski, joint chief executive officer of CD Projekt RED in today's presentation. "<em>Sales of the game have exceeded 35 million copies, which testifies to the franchise's enduring power and enables us to be even more audacious about charting its future</em>."</p>

			<p>A short two months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/developer-splash-damage-no-longer-owned-by-tencent-acquired-by-private-equity-investors/">it was acquired by an unnamed private equity group</a>, veteran support studio Splash Damage has announced it has entered a consultation process that will impact all staff members. While all current staff could potentially be laid off, it's unclear at the time of this writing how many will be impacted.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we announced to our teams that we are entering a studio-wide consultation process affecting all roles</em>," a post on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">studio's LinkedIn page began</a>. "<em>This was a difficult step for us to take, but we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout</em>."</p>



<p>After quietly pulling away from its previous parent company in September, Tencent, though the studio's future was unclear, there was a bit of a sense that it could fare better away from Tencent than under it. Now, however, it's clear that's not the case, and if the consultation process wraps up before the end of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/">it'll be the studio's second layoff in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Since 2020, Splash Damage has only been able to ship one game, Outcasters, which launched and died with Google Stadia. It supported games like Star Wars Hunters and Gears Tactics, but has been unable to get a game over the finish line since Outcasters. Its last major project, Transformers: Reactivate, was cancelled, which led to the layoffs in January 2025. </p>



<p>It's unfortunate to see Splash Damage struggle like so many other studios, especially because if this does end with the studio essentially shutting down, it'll be the latest veteran studio to be killed off. Splash Damage has been around for 20 years now, and that kind of staying power isn't easy to obtain. </p>
