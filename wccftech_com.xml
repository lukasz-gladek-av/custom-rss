			<p>Last week, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">announced that it had cast <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> to play <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Shortly after that, it confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> would be playing <strong>Sif</strong> in the series</a>, which gave us more of an insight into how the show is approaching the God of War story. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/max-parker-cast-god-of-war-heimdall-1236691740/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that <strong>Max Parker</strong> will play <strong>Heimdall</strong>, giving us a bit more insight into the show's story. But it seems that a report from <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qenyu0/potential_god_of_war_tv_casting_leaks/">Reddit</a>, that correctly identified Parker and Palmer's casting, could also be correct about the casting choices for the show's version of <strong>Thor</strong> and <strong>Mimir</strong>.</p>



<p>Parker is the latest actor to join the cast of the God of War TV series, and knowing that he'll be playing Heimdall further confirms what Palmer's casting as Sif already indicated, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be leaning on characters not introduced in the games until <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> to tell this new version of Kratos and Atreus' story.</p>



<p>Which means we likely have more than a few casting announcements yet to come, since we'll likely also get an appearance from characters introduced in Ragnarok like <strong>Odin</strong> and <strong>Tyr</strong>. There's also still characters from <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> that have yet to be cast, including <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, but if NerdBot is correct, the next announcements we're likely to see will be the casting for Thor and Mimir.</p>



<p>For Thor, the proposed choice is <strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll likely recognzie from the hit Apple TV+ show, <strong>Severance</strong>, while for Mimir, it seems that Amazon doesn't want to fix what isn't broken, as the NerdBot report claims that <strong></strong><strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as Mimir for the show.</p>



<p>Even though NerdBot's report was correct about Parker and Palmer's casting ahead of their reveal, you should still take its other picks with a grain of salt. That said, they're not outlandish or bad picks by any stretch, and in fact make a lot sense, which makes them even easier to believe. Still, it's not official, which is why this is still tagged as a just a rumor for now.</p>



<p>With the show reportedly set <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">to start filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, if that's still the case then we'll likely see official confirmations of more casting decisions soon. While none of these choices have been off the mark so far, the cast from both God of War (2018) and Ragnarok are all stellar performers. Hopefully, Alastair Duncan isn't the only cast member who gets to play their role in both.</p>

			<p>Independent publisher <strong>Dear Villagers</strong> and developer <strong>Sedleo</strong> have announced that the action/adventure game <strong>1348 Ex Voto</strong> will be released on <strong>March 12</strong>, though only for PC and PlayStation 5, as the Xbox Series S|X version has been canceled. This is far from shocking. Xbox Series console sales have been dwindling for several years now; for small studios, spending resources on the port might no longer be worth the cost. </p>



<p>Anyway, the game itself looks quite interesting. Developed by a team of around 15 Italian developers, it is set in 14th-century Italy, a period marked by political strife and the plague (which raged for a long time). The protagonist, <strong>Aeta</strong>, voiced by <strong>Alby Baldwin</strong>, is a young noble training to become a knight errant. However, her village is suddenly attacked by bandits, who also kidnap <strong>Bianca</strong> (voiced by award-winning actress <strong>Jennifer English</strong>, who played Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3 and Maelle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33), someone very dear to Aeta. Thus begins her dangerous journey across the Italian peninsula, with environments ranging from medieval villages and castles to the Appennino mountains and even the ruins of classical Rome, to rescue Bianca.</p>



<p>The creators from Sedleo drew inspiration from chivalric story tropes and spent extensive time in rural Italy recording environments to create an authentic, historically plausible world. The 'cinematic' combat system <strong>is inspired by HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts)</strong> and was animated with the help of trained performance-capture actors.</p>



<p>Aeta's martial knowledge will allow players to <strong>strategically choose between two combat stances</strong>: one-handed and two-handed weapons. Skill books have been scattered throughout the environments, and players who can find them will <strong>unlock new combos to personalize Aeta's swordplay</strong> with different weapon parts.</p>

<p>On PC, 1348 Ex Voto will be available for purchase via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895900/1348_Ex_Voto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/1348-ex-voto-251865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. The official system requirements haven't been revealed yet, but we know that the price will be <strong>$24.99</strong> on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> dropped a bombshell of an announcement today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">cancelling six projects, including the long-awaited <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, delaying seven more</a>, and restructuring the entire company into five separate <strong>Creative Houses</strong>. Those are the basic facts of what's changed for Ubisoft. As to how it'll execute and drive this new structure, the answer for Ubisoft appears to lie within <strong>more layoffs</strong>, a <strong>return-to-office mandate,</strong> and increased investments in what it deems to be "<em>cutting-edge technology,</em>" namely investing further in "<em>player-facing <strong>Generative AI</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, the basic structure of Ubisoft as a company is changing. It's moving to a decentralized model, with five Creative Houses that will sit under Ubisoft headquarters, each with its own financial responsibilities and total creative ownership of the brands and IPs held within each Creative House. Supporting each Creative House is a <strong>Creative Network</strong> of studios to help with production, and supporting everything will be its <strong>Core Services</strong>. You can see the basic breakdown of it all in the image below, from a press release. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ubisoft-Creative-Houses-Restructure.png"></a><figcaption><em>Ubisoft's new Creative Houses structure. Image credit: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not included in the basic breakdown above are some of the key internal changes that Ubisoft is undergoing that it believes are necessary for the restructure to work. It's already started one of those changes, which is simply <strong>more layoffs</strong>. </p>



<p>"<em>As part of this effort to streamline operations and adapt to evolving market conditions, the Group has already taken decisive actions to adjust its studio footprint</em>," the press release reads. "<em>This includes the closure of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Halifax</a></strong> mobile studio earlier this month and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">Stockholm</a></strong> studio, as well as restructurings at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">Abu Dhabi</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">RedLynx</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive</a></strong></em>."</p>



<p>Unfortunately, these layoffs that we've already seen, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">closure of the <strong>Leamington</strong> studio,</a> which isn't mentioned here but does fall within the restructure timeline previously put out by Ubisoft, are not the end. The third and "<em>final phase</em>" of the restructure is still to come, with more set to be announced on <strong>February 12, 2026.</strong> That said, the third phase of this restructure is "<em>expected to be fully achieved by <strong>March 2026</strong></em>," so there could even be more layoffs announced after the February date. The company is looking to these cuts to drive <strong>€200</strong> <strong>million</strong> in savings. </p>



<p>Along with more organizational cuts, another key part of how it'll execute this new structure is a <strong>return-to-office mandate</strong>. Remote work is being killed off as an option across the company, and instead, employees will have a limited number of days allocated to them to work from home each year, basically equating work-from-home days to vacation or sick days for employees. </p>



<p>"<em>To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to <strong>five days per week on site for all teams</strong></em>, <em>complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days. This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams. In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity, and success in a persistently more selective AAA market</em>."</p>



<p>After the world spent the better part of two years locked in their homes and finding ways to make their jobs and lives work without leaving their dwellings, it's difficult to read claims that in-person collaboration and work are "<em>key</em>" to any process. Sure, being in the same room with others can often be the best way for a team to work, but after we had a slew of stellar titles released in recent years, several of which were made by entirely remote teams, we know that developers don't need to move across the world or commute for hours a day to make a good game. </p>



<p>If these mandates accelerate anything, it's company turnover, as many employees are unable to move to new locations if they suddenly need to be in the office five days a week. It's easier to see them as disguised or soft layoffs, instead of changes meant to better employee collaboration. </p>



<p>"<em>We really want to strengthen onsite collaboration, the collective dynamic across teams</em>," added Ubisoft's senior vice president of studio operations, <strong>Marie Sophie de Waubert</strong>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-asking-all-staff-to-return-to-office-full-time-to-boost-the-collective-performance-for-aaa">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>We know that in-person collaboration and interactions are key enablers of efficiency, creativity, and collective success in this persistently selective market. It's one enabler among others, but it's really one we believe in.</em>"</p>



<p>When pressed by GI.Biz about how this mandate will impact staff turnover, de Waubert said, "<em>the one and only objective is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.</em>" De Waubert also adds, "<em>We will, of course, discuss in due time with the different countries the modus operandi, and the flexibility linked to that evolution of our model. But the objective is really linked to the quality of our games and the quality of our creativity. And it's one enabler among others for the Creative Houses to reconnect with success and team engagement</em>."</p>



<p>Speaking of things not needed to make a good game, one of the final ways in which Ubisoft will try to execute its new structure comes from its new <strong>Core Services</strong> branch, which the company describes as "<em>the backbone of Ubisoft's ecosystem</em>." The teams under the Core Services branch will "<em>focus on delivering scalable technology, production capabilities and operational excellence across the Group</em>."</p>



<p>Among their responsibilities will be production services, i.e quality assurance, localization, playtests and game analytics. Also under the Core Services umbrella is the company's technological infrastructure, including its game engines, online services, IT infrastructure, and most notably, <strong>Generative AI</strong>.</p>



<p>In fact, the press release specifies "<em>player-facing Generative AI</em>," though it's short on what exactly that means. It could result in nothing, as GenAI is still far from <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-ceo-speaks-for-gamers-says-we-dont-want-genai-slop-we-want-ai-tools-that-help-game-devs/">establishing a place in game development</a>, even as major publishers like Ubisoft continue to push for it.</p>



<p>All of these changes, including the new structure, are due to be implemented as of <strong>April 2026</strong>, which means we'll know more about how these changes go as early as the end of this year, as we continue to monitor and cover Ubisoft as it goes through this massive shift.</p>
