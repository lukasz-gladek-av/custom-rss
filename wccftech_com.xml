			<p>CAPCOM <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this morning that Monster Hunter Wilds has already set new record sales. In the first three days since launch, the game sold over eight million units, becoming the fastest game to do so in the Japanese publisher's 45-year history.</p>
<p>This record-breaking milestone is not at all unexpected, given the immense hype surrounding the game after the highly successful entries Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise. Moreover, this past weekend, Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> a user concurrency peak of 1.38 million on Steam, stepping into the platform's all-time top five for this chart.</p>
<p>Of course, user reviews are still quite low at 58%, mostly due to the game's performance on PC. For now, CAPCOM hasn't said if they will improve the game's technical side, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are a few mods that might help</a>. Overall, though, this is a great game if you're into this type of experience, as outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds is the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series. While veterans may find the lower challenge level noticeable, and performance could definitely be better on PC, the improved onboarding and accessibility, a surprisingly engaging main campaign, excellent map and monster design, and refined combat make this entry a must-play for both newcomers and seasoned Hunters alike.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM has also promoted franchise producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, likely as a result of the series' excellent sales results. Starting on April 1, he'll replace Yoichi Egawa as the publisher's executive corporate officer and chief product officer.</p>
