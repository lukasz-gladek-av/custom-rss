			<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> at The Game Awards 2024, Korean developer Pearl Abyss finally nailed down a release window for Crimson Desert. The game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at G-Star 2019, and back then, it was still billed as an MMO that was not too dissimilar from the studio's premiere game, Black Desert. Not long afterward, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a genre change from MMO to single-player open-world action/adventure, albeit still with optional multiplayer support. Back then, the game was still tentatively headed toward a Winter 2021 launch, but in July 2021, Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the project had been indefinitely delayed.</p>

<p>Crimson Desert only <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resurfaced</a> at Gamescom 2023 with a gameplay trailer. Multiplayer appears to have been silently cut, but other than that, communication has been constant, and there have even been limited hands-on opportunities at various conventions. At the recent Game Developers Conference 2025 in San Francisco, Pearl Abyss put the spotlight on the game's BlackSpace Engine. According to the team, the proprietary technology can render vast, sprawling, and seamless open worlds with great detail. In the game, Kliff and his fellow Greymanes will traverse a variety of landscapes, including lush forests, medieval-inspired cities, snow-capped mountains, and vast deserts.</p>

<p>The simulations running under the hood of the BlackSpace Engine augment the realism of the environments: trees, grass, cloth, and hair are all naturally affected by wind movement. The environments featured in Crimson Desert also support real-time physics and destructibility, not to mention volumetric fog, real-time lighting, detailed atmospheric scattering effects, and dynamic weather. Optionally, ray tracing can further enhance visual realism. The engine also supports highly realistic water effects thanks to the usage of FFT Ocean simulation and Shallow Water simulation, creating realistic waves, currents, and ripples.</p>

<p>Lastly, the BlackSpace engine also improves combat encounters thanks to the detailed hit reactions and physics-based interactions.&nbsp;Object destruction can vary depending on the force applied, and enemies can dynamically collide with the environment, adding depth to combat. Pearl Abyss has shared several brief videos of the technology. You can find them embedded throughout this article.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, Crimson Desert promises a great variety of traditional content (quests, puzzles, dungeons), 'life' content (cooking, hunting, mining, gathering, fishing, crafting, horse taming), and a fairly complex combat system that combines parrying, blocking, dodging, jumping, and even some wrestling moves. The players will create their own unique combos.</p>

<p>Crimson Desert is slated to launch this Fall on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a> and Mac, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overclocked Nintendo Switch Can Run Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Skyrim and Other Titles at Averages Well Above 60 FPS, New Video Highlights]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-above-60-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though not at stock settings, even with its dated hardware, the Nintendo Switch is more than capable of pushing higher than 60 FPS averages, even in some demanding games.</p>
<p>A new video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a> on YouTube showcases how an overclocked system modded with 8GB RAM is capable of running several games at high framerates. Demanding games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are a little unstable but still manage to run at an average close to 100 FPS, but undemanding games and remasters like Sonic Superstars, Zelda: Skyward Sword HD and The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have no trouble hitting and keeping the 120 FPS mark.</p>
<p><iframe title="120Hz Gaming on Nintendo Switch - FPS Locker 2.2.0 Beta Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTjwd0Hsxo4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As an overclocked Nintendo Switch is still much weaker than its successor, the fact that it is capable of pushing high framerates suggests how the Nintendo Switch 2 may not have trouble doing the same, at least for backward-compatible titles. According to rumors, the upcoming console will feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-120-hz-vrr-screen/">120 Hz display with VRR support</a>, which would considerably improve handheld play not only for backward-compatible titles but even for next-generation titles, as a 120 Hz display with VRR support would open the door to 40 FPS support, which improves games considerably, despite the small difference over 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer if a high-framerate future is in the cards for Nintendo, as the Nintendo Switch 2 will be fully unveiled in a little over a week, on April 2nd, in a new Direct focused on the system. The event is also reportedly confirming the system's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">release date.</a></p>
