			<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR issues will be fixed in the near future, according to one of the game's developers.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-ps5-pro-upgrades-are-more-substantial-than-you-may-think">Digital Foundry</a>, the game's Principal Rendering Engineer Michal Drobot confirmed that the game's PSSR issues, which include white flickering pixels appearing in certain scenarios and smearing issues with ultra-fine details, will be addressed very soon, as fixes for these issues are already in the pipeline and will be rolled out soon once the relevant patch goes through QA. Reportedly, these issues are caused by PSSR not being fine-tuned for denoising the image in its current state, and, as such, works better in anti-aliasing the image but not denoising the flicker created by shadows, variable rate shading, and SSR.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will soon be fixed on PlayStation 5 Pro, Digital Foundry provided an in-depth look at how the development team improved the game on the system over the base model and how the engine was improved for the latest entry in the series. You can find the full analysis below.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>

			<p>The adventure games genre is usually a bit neglected by studios compared to more mainstream genres like action, roleplaying, and shooter. However, this year saw several great releases from indie and triple-A developers alike. Without further ado, let's dive into our shortlist for the best adventure game of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Indika-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Indika</h2>
<p>One of the biggest surprises of the year in the genre is undoubtedly Indika, the game developed by studio Odd Meter and published by 11 bit studios. In this game, set in the early 1800s in an alternate version of Russia, players step into the role of a young nun slowly adjusting to the harsh life of a convent. That's just the tip of the iceberg of her troubles, though, as Indika also somehow speaks with the Devil himself, who leads her on a journey of self-discovery that goes beyond the convent both physically and metaphorically. The game also features unique puzzle elements and 2D pixel art mini-games, as if its peculiar rendition of Russia wasn't already enticing enough.</p>
<p>Following its debut on PC, Indika recently launched on consoles, too, receiving widespread acclaim from fans and critics. It can be purchased for a 25% discount right now.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Riven_Key_Art_4k-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Riven</h2>
<p>Old-school gamers probably need no introduction to Riven. For everyone else, this is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riven-unreal-engine-5-remake-to-launch-this-year-on-pc-with-vr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of the cult classic second entry in the Myst series</a>. Following the release of the full remake of Myst, Cyan Worlds has prepared the same treatment for Riven, delivering a full 3D landscape remade in gorgeous Unreal Engine 5 and expanded with new puzzles and a deeper story. Virtual Reality users can immerse themselves even more fully into this mysterious island.</p>
<p>As a founding member among adventure games of the puzzle subgenre, it's great to see the Riven remake doing so well. Fans are now wondering whether Myst III: Exile will be next. Meanwhile, if you've yet to check it out, Riven can now be purchased at a 30% discount.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nobody-wants-to-die.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Nobody Wants to Die</h2>
<p>The other big surprise of 2024 came from Critical Hit Games, which released <a href="https://wccftech.com/nobody-wants-to-die-developers-release-10-minute-exclusive-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nobody Wants to Die</a> (published by PLAION) in the middle of July. Not exactly the best period to launch games, but this interactive story (think Quantic Dream's style) still managed to find its own niche.</p>
<p>The protagonist is Detective James Karra, and the story is set in a future (2329) version of New York City massively influenced by noir and cyberpunk settings. There's a serial killer on the loose who has been targeting upper class citizens. To complicate matters, Nobody Wants to Die takes a cue from the likes of Altered Carbon - here, too, the wealthy can afford to transfer their consciousness into new bodies to attain a sort of immortality. Karra also has his own tech gizmos to help him in the investigation, such as a time-manipulation augmentation that lets him review what happened at the crime scenes.</p>
<p>Nobody Wants to Die is currently 30% off on Steam.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dustborn_keyart_layered_4k-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Dustborn (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dustborn-a-familiar-feeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Norwegian developer Red Thread Games has been a staple of our Best Adventure Games series over the years, thanks to releases like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dreamfall-chapters-two-fates-bound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamfall Chapters</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/draugen-full-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Draugen</a>. Dustborn took longer to develop than the others, to be sure, but the result was quite worth the wait, according to reviewer Amy Eastland.</p>
<p><em>Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the relationships between the characters unfold. However, the prologue soured it early on for me, as it felt a bit too overexaggerated. The conversations and getting to explore new environments were some of the best parts of Dustborn, while I unfortunately found the combat system to be a little lacking in places. Still, the idea for this game is incredibly unique and one that I really enjoyed.</em></p>
<p>If you're into the concept of a road trip with friends across a dystopic USA where you play in a punk-rock band and also fight baddies with words, Dustborn is currently 60% off.</p>
<h2>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p>2024 saved the best for last, as they say. With Lara Croft and Nathan Drake missing from the gaming market, MachineGames brought back the man who inspired those characters - Indiana Jones - in style with their newly released Great Circle. The game admittedly features quite a bit of action, but it still fits more with the adventure genre, as it relies a lot more on puzzle solving, exploration, and non-lethal solutions to disagreements. Here's the final excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>The game is highly successful so far, having already <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-wants-more-indiana-jones-titles-after-the-massive-hype-brought-in-by-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snatched</a> a Game of the Year award from the Gamescom community, and Disney is reportedly very much open to greenlighting new Indiana Jones adventures.</p>

			<p>Among the best and most unexpected modding projects to launch this year was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, which brings some stunning visual improvements to one of the most popular role-playing games released this year, as highlighted by a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The end of 2024 montage shared by the project's developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a> does an excellent job highlighting the improvements the mod currently brings to the game in pretty much every location in the game. From higher texture quality to improved lighting and much more, the fan-made project looks every bit as good as any proper remaster should.</p>

<p>The development of the Bloodborne Remaster Project was made possible by the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator, which allows users to play the game developed by FromSoftware on PC even without an official port. A new version of the emulator bringing a variety of improvements was released <a href="https://shadps4.net/index.php/2024/12/25/shadps4-v0-5-0-christmas-2024-release/">last week</a>, and made two more PlayStation 4 exclusives playable on PC - Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise and The Witch &amp; The Hundred Knight 2. You can check out how the emulator runs both games in the videos below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first and only Grand Theft Auto 6 currently available has been found online in better quality, allowing fans to better appreciate its stunning visuals while they wait for Rockstar Games to finally show more of their highly anticipated open-world game.</p>
<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/GTASixInfo/status/1873532834838900846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873532834838900846%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GTASixInfo</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GameRollGTA</a> discovered a higher-quality version of the new trailer<span>&nbsp;compared to the one available on YouTube. This new version of the trailer, which was originally streamed on Chinese video streaming service BiliBili and can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLzVdNhcdtwUvWkDA-9_ZrBpzAcc0bDl/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, has a higher bitrate than the YouTube version, which</span>&nbsp;makes it easier to appreciate some of the visual's finer details.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the release of the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, but the anticipation for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games continues to become bigger by the day. Its release is expected by analysts to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch to date</a>, and its<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/"> release window will have an impact on the entire video game industry</a>, as other publishers are aiming to launch their games as far away from it as possible and are holding back setting release dates for them until Rockstar Games finally confirms if the game is indeed launching in late 2025, or if it will be delayed to 2026, which is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">definite possibility</a>, considering the game's scope.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is currently in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-cease-exclusive-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Remake series could cease to be a PlayStation console exclusive in 2025, judging from some recent statements.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://br.ign.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/134307/news/nao-podemos-ser-exclusivos-de-um-unico-console-diretor-de-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-diz-que-numeros-de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN Brazil</a> during The Game Awards 2024, Remake series producer Yoshinori Kitase commented on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sales and console exclusivity. While sales of the second entry in the series are deemed satisfactory despite the game not meeting profit expectations following launch, Kitase-san commented that it has become clear that modern games can no longer be exclusive to a single platform and that they need to be offered to as many players as possible.</p>
<p>Yoshinori Kitase isn't the only member of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series development team whose comments suggest the series could be coming to other platforms in the future. Speaking with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241216014/index_5.html#sqe_ham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer</a> as part of their end-of-the-year developer roundup, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi stated that the team will continue to take on the challenge of bringing the series to as many fans as possible in 2025. As the second entry in the series is coming to PC in less than a month, it's evident how Hamaguchi-san is likely talking about other platforms as well, such as the Xbox Series X and S and the Nintendo Switch 2, which should be able to handle both games with some compromises in terms of visuals and performance if the leaked specs are real.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it won't take too long for the Final Fantasy VII Remake series to be released on other platforms, as the first two entries in the series are excellent games that deserve to be experienced by any JRPG fan. You can learn more about the first entry by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">my review</a> and about Rebirth by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Graphics modder NiceGuy has just updated his<a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-and-complete-rt-shaders-get-major-updates-with-sky-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Complete RT</a> ReShade shader to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/complete-rt-1-6-118832379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 1.6</a>, claiming many improvements, such as up to three times faster performance.&nbsp;As shown in the video, running the Global Illumination mode at native resolution (100% on the slider) takes just 4ms versus the 13.5 ms of the previous Complete RT 1.5. This translates into much higher frame rates (71 FPS versus 49 FPS). Of course, this may vary depending on the game and the scene.</p>
<p>There's more, as the internal upscaler has received several updates. CompleteRT is now capable of dynamically adjusting the Global Illumination resolution with floating-point scales from 33% to 100%, and it can even automatically match the rendering resolution when using all the industry-standard upscalers from NVIDIA (DLSS), AMD (FSR), Intel XeSS, and even Epic's own Unreal Engine TSR. Additionally, this reportedly helps with performance, reduces flickering, and improves overall quality.</p>
<p>Complete RT's implementation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nvrtx-branch-has-been-updated-with-experimental-restir-gi-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> was also enhanced. NiceGuy says both performance and quality have received an upgrade, and the accuracy is now close to the ground truth image. Lastly, the new shader has better specular reflections, too, thanks to a fix for the flickering that used to appear when using low roughness values. The precision of the reflections and their performance was also improved.</p>
<p><iframe title="Complete RT 1.6 | Teaser Update: 3x faster RAY TRACING! better Upscaling &amp; ReSTIR GI, new NiceHancer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9gEk1j_j6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NiceGuy also announced a brand new shader called eLITE RT. This is meant to be a much lighter screen space ray traced GI shader that could potentially run even on low-end or handheld hardware. The modder says he spent months of research and development on this project, essentially swapping priorities compared to Complete RT. While the latter focuses on quality while still targeting solid performance, eLITE RT focuses on performance while trying to achieve good quality.</p>
<p>Both shaders are only available to his Patreon subscribers. While Complete RT is unlocked on the second tier, which costs $6 monthly, the new eLITE RT is currently only available for subscribers of the third tier, priced at $11.50 monthly. That's because it is still in beta and requires more testing and feedback; it will eventually be moved to the same tier of Complete RT once it's ready.</p>
