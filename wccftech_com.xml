			<p>The Battlefield 6 PlayStation 5 retail version reportedly has the full game on disk, requiring no additional download to play both the campaign and the multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/">series' official subreddit</a>, retail copies of the highly anticipated new entry in the series launching this week are already in the hands of some lucky players. One of these users reported that the full game is on disk and can be played without an additional download, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-retail-requires-full-download/">reversing a disappointing industry trend</a>. In addition, multiplayer servers are reportedly live, so those with early copies can already enjoy the full experience with no limitations.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Putting the full game on disk to avoid mandatory launch downloads is yet another indication of how the Battlefield 6 development teams have placed a greater focus on the technical elements of the game. With  solid optimization on every platform, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/">Xbox Series S</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">minimum spec PC hardware</a>, the market is set to reward this approach significantly, judging from pre-order numbers. According to data firm Ampere Analysis, the game has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-1-7-million-pre-orders-predicted-to-sell-5-million-first-week/">estimated 1.7 million pre-orders, and is expected to sell 5 million units in the first week of availability.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10 worldwide.</p>

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake Born From a Wish DLC and the Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are likely to be announced soon, according to a known insider.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Speaking on X</a>, Dusk Golem, who correctly provided news regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-transmission-announcements/">the revival of the KONAMI survival horror series</a> before the official announcement, stated that new announcements regarding last year's remake of the second entry in the series, including the remade higly-requested DLC expansion, the Xbox Series X|S versions and a new PlayStation 5 Pro patch to address <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-playstation-5-pro-looks-better-performance-mode/">some of the issues still found in this version of the game</a> shouldn't be too far off in the future. The announcements are likely being tied to the promotional cycle and release window of the Return to Silent Hill movie, which is based on the second entry in the series and will launch on January 23, 2026.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) Silent Hill 2 Remake, the PS5 Pro patch likely be timed with some announcements, Born From a Wish DLC should be announced sooner or later, &amp; likely Konami is tying it around the window of the upcoming Return to Silent Hill movie based off SH2.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1975058939093078093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As Dusk Golem's track record isn't spotless, we have to take today's statements with a massive grain of salt. At the same time, the Silent Hill 2 remake official website was updated over the past few days in a way that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nyr5z9/in_bloober_teams_website_silent_hill_2_remakes/"> suggests the remake could launch on other formats in the future</a>, so there's little doubt that KONAMI and Bloober Team are likely gearing up for some announcement, in light of the game's PS5 console exclusivity ending on October 8.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake launching on other gaming systems is good news, as the remake developed by Bloober Team is a game that any survival horror fan should experience.

			<p>The Outsiders, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-hellsinger-rock-on/">rhythm FPS game Metal: Hellsinger</a>, has been shut down as part of Funcom's <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/">recently confirmed layoffs</a>.</p>



<p>Former studio creative director and founder David Goldfarb <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1975200395128610955">confirmed the news in a statement on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, saying, "<em>I have not had much time to process the news but all of us at The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm</em> <em>have been affected by the layoffs at Funcom and our 10 year old studio will be closing." </em></p>



<p>"<em>Many of us have survived</em> <em>a near-death studio experience years back when Darkborn was cancelled, and because of this team's loyalty and refusal to quit, Metal: Hellsinger was born. It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen.</em></p>



<p><em>We had hoped to do something even better this time - things don't always go the way you hope. But we are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form If you think you can help in any way, with business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is, I would be genuinely grateful if you reach out here. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting. Thanks so much</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Goldfarb also posted the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/locust9_friends-i-have-not-had-much-time-to-process-activity-7380961160872841216-XIbs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">same statement to his LinkedIn account</a>, where he added that writing the statement "<em>sucked</em>" and that he was "<em>afraid to press post because it will make it real. Oh well.</em>"</p>



<p>Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-acquires-majority-stake-in-the-outsiders-founds-new-romanian-studio/">acquired The Outsiders back in 2021</a>, while the two studios were already working on Metal: Hellsinger with Funcom as the game's publisher. The studio had been independent for six years before being acquired.</p>



<p>When the layoffs at Funcom were confirmed last week, Funcom did not initially say how many developers were impacted. According <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-acquires-majority-stake-in-the-outsiders-founds-new-romanian-studio/">to The Outsiders' official website,</a> at least 30 developers were employed at the Sweden-based studio. </p>



<p>In Funcom's statement regarding its layoffs, it claimed that its new survival MMO, Dune: Awakening, was "<em></em><em>the biggest release we've had in our 32-year-long history of making great games</em>." The cuts were made due to Funcom deciding it did not need the same number of developers as work on Dune: Awakening transitioned from developing for launch to maintaining it and creating new content.</p>



<p><strong>Update 06/10/2025:</strong> <em>This article was updated to accurately reflect The Outsiders and Funcom Stockholm as the same entity, and not different studios</em>.</p>
