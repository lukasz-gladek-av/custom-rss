			<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved, the remake of the first entry in the Halo series announced last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">after months of rumors and speculation</a>, is set to introduce significant visual improvements over both the original and the Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster, judging from some early comparison videos shared online.</p>



<p>Following the game's announcement at this year's Halo WCC, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> shared two comparison videos on YouTube, comparing the current available footage of the remake with a recreation of similar sequences in the original and the Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster. Needless to say, the differences are massive between the modern remake and the other two versions of the game, offering an unprecedented level of fidelity that will make the iconic first entry in the series shine.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it's clear how, in terms of ambiance and atmosphere, Halo: Campaign Evolved won't try to mimic the original and will instead offer a different take. In this case, which will be better will be up to player's preference.</p>

<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">feature more than the updated visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5 </a>showcased in the comparison videos above. The remake of the first entry in the Halo series will also come with three new bonus missions set before the events of the campaign, four-player co-op, some gameplay tweaks, including the introduction of sprinting, and more. As the name implies, however, the multiplayer mode of the original Halo won't be remade.</p>



<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will also mark the series' debut on PlayStation consoles, further compounding Xbox's current multiplatform strategy, which saw the launch of former exclusives on other platforms. The remake will also launch on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>

			<p>Stray, the cat adventure game developed by BlueTwelve and published by Annapurna Interactive, will reportedly headline the PlayStation Plus Essential games lineup for November 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier today, known leaker billbil-kun, who <span>has proven extremely reliable regarding PlayStation Plus game lineup leaks in the past, revealed in a new report posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-connait-le-titre-phare-des-jeux-mensuels-de-novembre-2025-60690" target="_blank">Dealabs</a>&nbsp;that the game that made headlines when it was launched in July 2022 for being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8mOAV0KJLE">widely appreciated by cats as much as by their owners </a>will be available to all PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscribers</span> starting from November 4.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Stray's joining the PlayStation Plus library next month would be its return to the service rather than its debut. At launch, the game was made available as part of the PlayStation Plus Extra library and was available to subscribers for around one year. The game's departure from the PlayStation subscription service <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/stray-xbox-release-date/">coincided with the end of its one-year console exclusivity.</a></p>



<p>Although Stray's addition to the PlayStation Plus subscription service may be disappointing for some users, especially after<a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/"> this month's addition of the excellent Alan Wake 2</a>, there could still be some surprises waiting in the wings. Two more titles will be part of November's lineup, which is expected to be revealed in full later this week, on October 29.</p>



<p>For those who never had the chance to try out the game before, however, Stray will be an excellent addition to the PlayStation Plus library, as the game features some great visuals, a richly-realized world, fun platforming, and more. You can learn more about it by checking out <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/stray-genre-curious-cat/">Nathan Birch's review of the PlayStation 5 version.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-game-of-the-year-%E2%80%98votes%E2%80%99-from-phil-spencer-and-naoki-hamaguchi.1335574/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The likelihood of a roleplaying game once again getting most Game of the Year prizes after 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 is very high thanks to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The game has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scored many nominations from the Golden Joystick Awards 2025</a>, with the winners due to be announced in a week from today.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the surprising sleeper hit of the year has received two endorsements from industry figures like Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer and Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Famitsu</a>, Spencer mentioned various games as his personal 2025 highlights, but ultimately picked Sandfall Interactive's debut title out of the bunch.</p>



<p><em>Excluding our games… I love the game I'm playing now, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that's very good. Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was also good. Also, although it is a game for PlayStation 5 and PC, my friend director Kojima's Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The Game of the Year is probably Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></p>



<p>While not exclusive to Microsoft's platforms, the game was available on its subscription service, Game Pass, from day one. As such, one could think Spencer might be slightly biased in his choice, but he's far from the only one who thinks Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 deserves such recognition. Hamaguchi-san <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-directors-goty-pick-and-not-just-because-it-features-jrpg-inspired-combat-it-gets-all-of-the-elements-in-it-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Gamesradar the same thing</a>, although he was also careful to highlight how its merits go beyond the advancements made to turn-based combat:   </p>



<p><em>It's a really great game and would deserve Game of the Year. I'd like to see them get that. What makes that game so good is the fact it gets all of the elements in it right, and it balances them all at such a high level of quality. The setting, the world, the characters, and the storyline, those are all really well done as well, in addition to the gameplay. And I think it all comes together, and that's why it's such a well-regarded game, why the fans like it so much, why it sold as well as it had.</em></p>



<p>As you may remember, there was a bit of a controversy with Square Enix. A few years ago, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida famously excused the game's lack of a turn-based combat option <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the statement that it did not mix well with realistic graphics</a>. Following the smashing success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, some Final Fantasy fans have been hoping that Square Enix might change its stance in the future, but for now, there have been no such announcements. It will ultimately be up to the producers of the next mainline installments to choose what's best.</p>



<p>In other Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 news, one of the biggest Hollywood stars of the past couple of years has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollywood-star-glen-powell-loves-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently expressed interest in being part of the film adaptation</a>. By the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have our own TGS 2025 interview with Naoki Hamaguch</a>i about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Part 3, in case you missed it earlier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-update-custom-search-player-movement-progression-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised on Friday</a>, the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion) have released the patch notes for update 1.1.1.0, which is set to go live tomorrow ahead of the debut of Season 1. The update will be released at 9:00 UTC, whereas the new season will be enabled at 15:00 UTC.</p>



<p>With this update, the developers aim to address some of the biggest pain points the Battlefield 6 community lamented in the game's first few weeks. For example, the player character's core movement and animations have been refined to provide smoother landings, faster stance transitions, and improved vaulting behaviour. Bouncing issues when landing or spawning have also been reduced.</p>



<p>When it comes to shooting, players have complained about weapon dispersion, which this patch reworks to better align the accuracy and handling of each weapon with its intended design and performance over range. These changes address cases where the accuracy was inconsistent, such as when dispersion did not properly settle after sprinting. The developers believe the tweaks will bring the overall firing behavior closer to the intended balance between precision, control, and weapon power.</p>



<p>Furthermore, users had requested visibility and lighting improvements, and the developers promise this new version of Battlefield 6 will feature better exposure transitions, interior lighting, and reduced fog and smoke persistence. There's even more to patch 1.1.1.0, including improvements to audio and user interface and, of course, a long list of fixes you can read all about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2807960/view/534364965583194766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the official changelog post</a>.</p>



<p>Between this patch and the debut of Season 1, EA and the development teams are hoping to keep the momentum going. The game's launch was as successful as they wanted, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking franchise sales records</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garnering acclaim from critics</a> and fans alike. Season 1 will be pivotal, although <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">based on the hands-on by our David Carcasole</a>, there are highlights (the new Conquest maps) and downsides (the new small group modes).</p>



<p>The Battle Royale mode is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to make its debut in Battlefield 6 tomorrow</a>, although there has been no official comment yet.</p>
