			<p>Video game publisher tinyBuild has teamed up with indie developer Fire &amp; Frost Studios to reveal their upcoming title Of Ash and Steel, an immersive third-person RPG which is inspired by old-school exploration and storytelling. This title is set to release in 2025 on PC via Steam. Of Ash and Steel draws inspiration from classic fantasy RPGs, offering a nostalgic experience that captures the old-school spirit of adventure, combining it with modern graphics and designs with expansive character progression and dynamic combat.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel takes you to the Kingdom of the Seven, where you work on honing your combat skills and creating alliances with those you find on your journey to survive in a harsh land. You start off as a lowly adventurer, but have a lot of potential to become a great hero that people won't be forgetting any time soon. Compared to a lot of RPGs, Of Ash and Steel doesn't plan to hold your hand, as there are no quest markers that tell you where to go. Instead, the exploration is entirely up to you, and you have to rely on your instincts and curiosity to take you to where you need to go. Of course, along the way, you will find plenty of secrets, treasures, and side quests, which will provide you with a lot of content.</p>

<p>To celebrate the announcement of the upcoming RPG, a five-minute trailer has been released on the tinyBuild YouTube channel, which showcases the graphics, some of the characters you'll meet along the way, and most importantly, the world in which you'll be thrown.</p>
<p>As you explore the Kingdom of the Seven, you'll get to experience an immersive atmosphere with a dynamic weather system, a suited soundtrack, and lots of rewards for those who choose to explore the vast wilderness ahead of them. If you're looking for the medieval RPG experience, the game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist now on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with when the game is set to release in 2025.</p>
<p>Of Ash and Steel is the first game to be released by Fire &amp; Frost Studios, an indie studio that describes itself as "a small studio by choice... of enthusiasts with burning hearts and cool heads."</p>
<p>When it comes to teaming up with publishers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tinybuild-acquires-banner-saga-versus-evil-and-qa-testing-firm-red-cerberus/">tinyBuild is one of the most well-known publishers</a> in the indie world, as they are responsible for releasing games such as Hello Neighbor, Graveyard Keeper, and SpeedRunners, with some of their most recent games being Kingmakers and SAND.</p>
