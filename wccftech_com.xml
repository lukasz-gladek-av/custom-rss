			<p>Per Famitsu's sales records published by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/famitsu-sales-9-1-25-9-7-25">Gematsu</a>, the PlayStation 5 has surpassed<strong> 7 million units sold in Japan</strong> as of September 7, 2025.</p>



<p>After the console hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million units shipped last month,</a> this is the latest hardware milestone reached, with an estimated 7,009,937 units sold in Japan between the PlayStation 5 Pro and the digital and physical versions of the base PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>It's leagues above the Xbox Series family of consoles, which have, according to the same list of Famitsu's latest numbers, sold only an estimated 682,927 units between the Xbox Series X/S, and is starting to catch up with the PlayStation 4, which has sold approximately 7,929,886 units in its lifetime.</p>



<p>The fact that PlayStation 5 is already catching up to the PS4 in the region shows how strong sales are in Japan for this current generation, though by that same token, it also shows just how strong the PlayStation 4's presence was in Japan, and how the PS5 continues to lag behind its predecessor in Japan, and across the world. And recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price increases to the console across the globe</a> certainly won't help move units. </p>



<p>That said, when it comes to videogame console sales in Japan, PlayStation continues to be dwarfed by Nintendo and its family of consoles. The Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold an estimated 1,980,483, while the Nintendo Switch has sold an estimated 35,969,655 since 2017.</p>
