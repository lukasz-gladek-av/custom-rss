			<p><strong>FFVII Remake Intergrade</strong> launched last month on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> (and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong>). Overall, it was a solid port, though <strong>the Xbox Series S version <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offers better texture quality than the Switch 2 version</a></strong>, despite having less RAM available.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo Switch 2 players have been slightly disappointed to see that <strong>FFVII Remake Intergrade is only available on Game Key Cards rather than regular cartridges</strong>. Game Key Cards were introduced with the new Nintendo console and offer a hybrid format: they are physical cards that users must insert into their console, but they don't actually contain any data. Instead, <strong>they serve only as proof of ownership and require users to download the game data to their console's storage</strong>. </p>



<p>Now, Automaton <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-nintendo-switch-2-release-was-from-a-technical-standpoint-only-possible-with-game-key-cards-director-naoki-hamaguchi-explains-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to ask the question directly to Square Enix's Game Director</a>, <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong>, who shared a very frank response: <strong>game key cards load roughly twice as fast as cartridges</strong>, so <strong>there was no other viable option for the game developers</strong>.</p>



<p><em>There’s simply no way around key cards in certain respects. If you compare loading directly from a game cartridge (containing all game data) to loading from the Nintendo Switch 2’s internal storage,<strong> the load speed difference is roughly double</strong>. Some have expressed concern that multiplatform development may impose constraints not only on graphics, but even on game design itself. However, this is precisely why we didn’t choose a cartridge.</em></p>



<p><em>Our game design isn’t built around loading all data upfront, with nothing further being loaded afterward. Even during gameplay, data is constantly swapped in and out, and given that premise, <strong>the loading speed from a game card would inevitably be insufficient</strong>, leading to stress for the player. In addition, with currently available cartridge capacity, <strong>there is the practical limitation that the full game data simply wouldn’t fit in the first place</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em>However, as long as we can secure the high-speed storage read speeds such as SSD or UFS (on Switch 2), the design we’re aiming for becomes achievable within the scope of optimization for each platform. For the third game in the trilogy, we’re proceeding with development with the goal of delivering a large-scale experience similar to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, so please rest assured on that point.</em></p>



<p><em>In the past, when faced with practical issues related to load speed and storage capacity we couldn’t resolve, we had to decide not to release on Nintendo systems. However, <strong>Nintendo Switch 2’s performance is impressive, and with a key card format like FFVII Remake, releasing the games became possible</strong>.</em></p>



<p>We've heard the same argument before from <strong>Ubisoft Massive</strong> when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-forced-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained why they chose Game Key Cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 version of <strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></a>: <strong>the cartridges simply did not have the performance needed to run the game smoothly</strong>.</p>



<p>As for FFVII Remake, Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-multiplatform-lower-quality-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this week</a>, as part of the Automaton interview, that <strong>switching to a full multiplatform strategy for Part 3 won't lead to lower quality visuals</strong> because they are targeting the best version (PC) and then scaling down, not the other way around. We should learn more about Part 3 in the coming months; stay tuned. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[God of War Trilogy Remake Will Feature New Combat System, Says Christopher Judge; Cory Barlog’s Game to Be Revealed in Late Summer]]></title>

			<p>The news that <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working on a <strong>God of War Trilogy remake</strong></a> certainly hyped fans, though it will likely be a long while until we get new information from the developer. </p>



<p>Thankfully, actor <strong>Christopher Judge</strong>, who plays <strong>Kratos</strong> in 2018's God of War and 2022's God of War Ragnarök, has kindly shared a few details <a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while speaking to YouTuber Fuzhpuzy</a> at Fan Expo Vancouver this past weekend.</p>



<p>When asked if he would be featured in the God of War Trilogy remake, he predictably replied no, adding that the original actor who played Kratos in those games, <strong>TC Carson</strong>, would reprise the role. That part had already been clarified from the studio, but Judge went on to say that, while not a reboot, <strong>the remakes would feature new technology and a new fighting system</strong>.</p>



<p>Judge also seemingly teased <strong>the reveal of Cory Barlog's next game</strong>:</p>



<p><em>And then you'll be hearing about what we're doing, probably in late Summer.</em></p>



<p>This info lines up perfectly with what two major insiders, <strong>NatetheHate</strong> and <strong>Shinobi602</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-creators-next-game-targeting-2027-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just shared a few days ago</a>: Sony Santa Monica's next title, directed by Cory Barlog, will be revealed in the Summer for a targeted 2027 launch.</p>



<p>Given that Christopher Judge mentioned late Summer, we can probably exclude Summer Game Fest. Potential candidates include <strong>Gamescom</strong> and <strong>PAX Prime</strong>, although the most likely scenario remains <strong>a dedicated State of Play</strong>.</p>



<p>As for what it's going to be, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-60#post-151517563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to another insider</a>, Ashhong from the ResetEra board (who was legitimized by Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>), <strong>this won't be another God of War entry</strong>. However, if you've been following the rumors on Cory Barlog's next game, this shouldn't surprise you; Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported last year</a> that while not based on a new franchise, it would "feel like it", and that definition certainly does not fit the God of War IP.</p>
