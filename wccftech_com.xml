			<p>Exactly two years ago, Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment released Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, an open world action/adventure game set in the fictional world created by James Cameron's movies.</p>



<p>Despite the hype surrounding the combination of the developer behind the successful The Division franchise and such a high-profile intellectual property, which grossed over $5.2 billion in film sales alone, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora didn't receive the warmest welcome from either critics or gamers. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch rated it 7.5 out of 10, noting that it was a remarkable technical achievement, but the combat often felt frustrating. The game didn't set any new sales records, either.</p>



<p>That said, it has a second wind to exploit now: the upcoming release of the third movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, scheduled to be available in theaters from December 19. That's why Massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-expansion-december-release-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is going to launch a new expansion called From the Ashes</a> on that same day. </p>



<p>In the meantime, though, they just released the big 2.0 free update. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> a few months ago, it includes the long-requested third-person view modes and New Game+. <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-leak-shows-new-images-game-likely-to-be-first-person-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ever since the first leaks</a>, it was clear that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora would be a first-person only game, but that's changed now, potentially opening up the experience to all those players who can't or won't deal with first-person motion, due to sickness or sheer preference. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Following the patch, players can seamlessly switch between first and third-person by pressing the J key on PC, holding the touchpad on PlayStation 5, or holding the View button on Xbox Series S and X. As for New Game+, it allows you you carry over all of your gear and skills from a completed playthrough and even get access to a new skill tree for the Sarentu, as well as higher level gear. As you'd expect in such a mode, you will face more challenging enemies.</p>



<p>But that's not all that the developer has added in Update 2.0. There are several notable additions from a technical standpoint, including NVIDIA DLSS 4 (the latest transformer model, although the previous CNN model can still be selected), DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xess-2-now-enabled-in-44-games-more-titles-coming-soon-enhanced-ai-upscaling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XeSS 2</a>, XeSS Frame Generation, and AMD FSR 4, though the latter can only be enabled by AMD users at a driver level, not in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p>



<p>That said, Massive shared a few known issues related to Frame Generation:</p>



<ul>
<li>Crash on startup when XeSS Frame generation is enabled.</li>



<li>Frame Generation cannot be activated while the Steam Overlay is on.</li>



<li>FSR3 Frame Generation causes stuttering when used in Borderless Fullscreen.</li>



<li>Switching from Borderless to Fullscreen while Frame Generation is on causes the framerate to drop significantly.</li>
</ul>



<p>Hopefully, those can be fixed soon.</p>

			<p>The final triple-A game release of the year, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, was just released. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed the game for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but the game is also available for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Indeed, as you might remember, it was initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the previous Switch during Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight, just a few months after that console's debut. It famously had a troubled development phase, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-indeed-developed-bandai-namco-according-multiple-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had originally picked Bandai Namco</a> instead of Retro Studios to make the game. </p>



<p>The project wasn't going well, which led to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being rebooted and handed back to Retro Studios</a>, resulting in an inevitable significant delay. Even though the Austin-based studio eventually launched the game well after the debut of the Switch 2, Nintendo still kept its promise to release the game on the original Switch, too.</p>



<p>That's great news even for PC gamers because, while there are no Switch 2 emulators yet, there are plenty of Switch emulators. Sure, Nintendo cracked down hard on the scene and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced the closure of Yuzu</a> (and its fork<span>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/suyu-yuzus-emulator-fork-gets-taken-down-just-hours-after-the-first-build-release/" target="_blank">Suzu</a>), but many alternatives are still active, including <a href="https://ryujinx.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryubing</a>, an open-source fork based on</span> the historic Ryujinx emulator, as well as newer emulators like <a href="https://eden-emu.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eden</a> and <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citron</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metroid prime 4: Beyond - Eden vs Citron" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxSycDP8e3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All of these are running Metroid Prime 4 well, as you can see from the embedded video. But the real kicker is that with ReShade, it's even possible to render the game (and other Switch titles) in stereoscopic 3D and play it on a giant screen through the <a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtual Desktop software</a>. To begin, you will need to <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download ReShade</a> 6.6.2 with full add‑on support and the Rendepth shader to convert the game’s depth buffer into a side‑by‑side 3D image that Virtual Desktop can interpret as stereoscopic video.</p>



<p>After installing ReShade (select the Vulkan option), enable the Rendepth shader and set the output to side-by-side with stereo strength at 100%, Z-buffer scaling at around 30, and parallax/overlap adjusted to your preference. To verify that depth is being captured correctly, ensure that the Show depth buffer setting is toggled on and use the AdjustDepth/DisplayDepth add-on to cycle through Vulkan depth sources until the buffer displays a proper gradient from black to white, rather than a flat white image.</p>



<p>If the depth preview is inverted, upside‑down, or flat, simply edit ReShade's global preprocessor definitions, toggling flags such as “depth input is reversed” or “depth input is upside down” from 0 to 1, until the depth image looks correct. Once the right Vulkan depth source is selected (it'll be the one with the most vertices) and the image is oriented correctly, disable the debug view, enable performance mode, and keep Rendepth active to generate the 3D image in normal gameplay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Using Rendepth and ReShade to play stereoscopic 3D Metroid Prime 4 and Switch games." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoCFGIvgiA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Now, in Virtual Desktop, set the 3D mode to half side‑by‑side or over‑under so that the double image from Rendepth fuses into a stereoscopic view on the virtual big screen. The creator of the video, lionellion, describes the result as a “Nintendo 3DS pop‑out” visor effect with a presentation akin to having a giant curved screen in front of you. Of course, to replicate this effect, you will need a Virtual Reality/XR headset or glasses or a glassless 3D display <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-2d-3d-gaming-monitor-concept-supports-glassless-3d-and-vr-gaming-wins-ces-2024-innovation-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like this one</a>. </p>



<p>Needless to say, playing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on PC can only be legally done if you purchased an original copy for the Nintendo Switch and then dumped it for your own personal use.</p>
