			<p>At the time of this writing, there are still just under 60 hours left in 2025, which means that the jury is still out on which game was the best-selling game of the year on the biggest PC storefront, Steam. That said, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025"><strong>Steam Charts</strong></a> has already declared the games that were part of the top 100 best-selling games by revenue on the platform, and while it doesn't list the titles in order, we know that some of the top 12 games include ARC Raiders, Schedule I, Hollow Knight Silksong, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>At least that's the case for the list of new games released in 2025. When you look at top sellers across the platform, including games not released in 2025, the top 12 look more like what you'd expect, with Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, PUBG, Apex Legends, and Marvel Rivals making up almost half of the top 12.</p>



<p>As for the new releases, however, the top 12 make it clear that games with a multiplayer focus are still the majority of what sells on the platform, with 9/12 games either featuring multiplayer or having multiplayer as the core element. But that's not to say single-player experiences aren't selling or essential to what players are looking for today.</p>



<p>Dune: Awakening may be a multiplayer game, but you can experience so much of it without really interacting with other players. Hollow Knight Silksong is an entirely solo journey, as is The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, all of which made the top 12.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top 12 best-selling new games on Steam for 2025, sorted randomly:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule I</li>



<li>Sid Meier's Civilization VII</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Dune: Awakening</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable element to this list is what's left off, specifically Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which was able to make the next tier of best-selling games, but couldn't beat Battlefield 6 and Borderlands 4, the two other first-person shooters you could argue are its biggest competition.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that, whatever your stance on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studio's use of GenAI</a>, it is incredibly impressive for ARC Raiders to arrive as a brand-new franchise and be one of the year's most popular, best-selling titles. ARC Raiders and Schedule I are the only two games that aren't based on a previously-existing franchise or series that made the list, and Schedule I's accomplishment is even more impressive when you factor in the fact that it's a self-published indie game.</p>



<p>The final tally will come after 2025 is officially over, and we'll get a list that's not in a random order once firms like Circana and Newzoo publish their findings. In the meantime, you can check out Wccftech's Best of 2025 lists, which include several of the top-selling games mentioned. Like Hollow Knight Silksong's appearance in <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/">Best Platformers</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Best Indie Games</a>, or ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 making the cut for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2025-the-power-of-togetherness/">Best Multiplayer Games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Using <strong>Generative AI</strong> in game development has been, and will continue to be, a controversial topic for the foreseeable future. Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">backlash that hit Larian Studios following their CEO's admission to using GenAI</a> in the development of Divinity, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stripped-of-indie-game-awards-goty-win-over-genai-use/">Sandfall Interactive's <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> losing one of its Game of the Year wins due to the studio using GenAI</a> in the game's development, it has once again been at the forefront of industry conversation. Now, Level-5 chief executive officer Akihiro Hino has weighed in with his view, prompted by Clair Obscur losing its GOTY win.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650">In a post shared on Hino's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, Hino outlines that, in his view, GenAI is able to provide "<em>time savings that can't be dismissed</em>," and that if we continue to build "<em>the impression that 'using AI is bad,' it could seriously hinder the progress of modern digital tech</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>今日はめずらしく、自分が作っているゲームの話ではないことを書きます。</p><p>【AIをめぐる騒動について】…</p></div>— 日野晃博 (@AkihiroHino) <a href="https://twitter.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hino begins by clarifying a point on GenAI surrounding one of Level-5's upcoming titles, after there were claims that the studio was letting generative AI do all the programming. The Professor Layton and Ni No Kuni developer is not doing that, according to Hino, and calls the whole thing a misunderstanding, saying, "<em>The truth of the matter is that there's an unreleased title themed around AI, and for that specific title, a programmer mentioned they're deliberately having AI handle the programming as well. They used that as an example to suggest that an era like that might be coming, and that's what got blown out of proportion</em>."</p>



<p>Hino then continues to share his viewpoint on GenAI, which emphasizes that the technology is a tool, and one that, ultimately, cannot be ignored.</p>



<p>"<em>AI is enabling time savings that can't be dismissed, and I believe this has the potential to upend common sense in game development. It might shift us from a world where developing the AAA games everyone wants to play takes 5-10 years to one where we get to enjoy them every two years. AI sometimes gets treated like it's synonymous with plagiarism, but a knife can be used for cooking or as a weapon; a computer can create games or enable cybercrime. AI might produce plagiarized content if misused, but if used properly, it has the power to enrich the creative world even further</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I want to see games evolve even more in my lifetime</em>," Hino continues. "<em>I want to experience and create dreamlike games that surpass the standards of today's AAA titles. If we let the impression take hold here that 'using AI is evil,' it could seriously hinder the advancement of modern digital technology. I hope creators and audiences alike can recognize 'AI' as a tool that people use to make their works. Here's to hoping that various technological innovations lead to even greater growth in the game industry!</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘GOG Stands for Freedom, Independence, and Genuine Control’, Says Michał Kiciński, the GOG Co-Founder Who Just Acquired the Digital Store from CD Proj]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gog-acquired-by-co-founder-from-cd-projekt-red/</link>
            <guid>1393888</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Co-founder of CD Projekt RED and of Good Old Games (GOG), Michał Kiciński, has just acquired the digital storefront from CD Projekt RED. Kiciński, CDPR, and GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/">announced the news today in a blog post on the official GOG Blog</a>, as Kiciński promises to keep the founding values of GOG at the forefront of how the store operates.</p>



<p>"<em>GOG stands for freedom, independence, and genuine control," </em>Kiciński said. That was the bedrock of the store when Kiciński and Marcin Iwiński founded the store over a decade ago, and that seems to be the same mission statement that is carrying the platform into this new era, as control returns to one of the platform's original co-founders.</p>



<p>"<em>GOG is entering a new chapter. Michał Kiciński</em>, <em>co-founder of CD Projekt and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD Projekt</em>," the platform announced on its <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375">official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever. Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library you control rather than one that controls you, and offering the most gamer-friendly policies on the market.</em>" </p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>GOG is entering a new chapter.</p><p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD PROJEKT and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p><p>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever.</p><p>Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library…</p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In the blog post, an FAQ outlines how players don't have to do or change anything about their account, and that there is essentially no change for them on the user side. "<em>DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever</em>," the blog post reads, and the platform will also maintain its strong relationship with CD Projekt RED and continue to release CDPR games on the platform.</p>



<p>The platform also clarified that it is not in a bad way financially, and for the platform, this move is more about keeping the platform's core values at the forefront and protecting the platform through this independence.</p>



<p>"<em>To us at GOG, this feels like the best way to accelerate what is unique about GOG. Michał Kiciński is one of the people who created GOG around a simple idea: bring classic games back, and make sure that once you purchase a game, you have control over it forever. With him acquiring GOG, we keep long-term backing that is aligned with our values: freedom, independence, control, and making games stay playable over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Altogether, while this acquisition still has a great deal of significance in the fact that one of the more popular digital storefronts for PC players is changing hands, it doesn't feel like a major change at all, considering who it is going to and what will change about the platform going forward. GOG will remain the best place to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">grab older titles through its preservation efforts</a>, to find <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/">premium mods like Fallout: London</a>, and the place <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-horses-banned-from-epic-games-store-at-last-minute-steam-ban/">where games like Horses can thrive on</a> while other platforms ban it from sale.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BetterVR Mod Lets You Experience Breath of the Wild in VR, And You Should Grab It Before Nintendo Tries to Kill It]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vr-mod-bettervr-nintendo/</link>
            <guid>1393858</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Five years ago, in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a developer known as Crementif started to work on a VR mod so they could cut down trees in the <strong>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>. After they figured out how to cut down trees in VR in Breath of the Wild, they kept working on it, and that initial idea became <strong>BetterVR</strong>, a full VR mod for Breath of the Wild that will let you experience the expansive world of Hyrule for the first time all over again. Until Nintendo tries to kill it, that is.</p>



<p>A trailer for the mod was released by Crementif and Flat2VR Studios just two days prior to its release today, announcing the mod and showcasing just how impressive it is - and it is incredibly impressive. The mod <a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR">is currently available to download</a>, and it works with a copy of Breath of the Wild for the Wii U that has been emulated and can run on your PC through Cemu version 2.6.</p>



<p>Though, as comments on the trailer and everywhere else Crementif's story has been shared point out, you'll want to get your hands on this mod and get it set up before Nintendo tries to kill it with their legal team. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Zelda BOTW VR Mod Trailer - Releasing In 2 Days!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDuxoo0kNsc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nintendo's litigious history is well known, whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">it is striking down entire emulators</a>, mods <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/">for games like Breath of the Wild</a>, or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-patent-on-summoning-and-battling-characters-re-examination-by-us-patent-office/">stretch the meaning of a patent to take out major competitors in the industry</a>. It wouldn't be a surprise if Flat2VR Studios and Crementif were contacted by Nintendo soon, if they haven't already.</p>



<p>Of course, Nintendo will not necessarily go after this mod over the scores of mods available for Breath of the Wild - <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-modded-ray-tracing/">like this one that adds ray tracing and makes the eight-year-old game look brand new</a> -  it's just something that's always a concern when projects like this pop up. So, in the meantime, if you have the necessary hardware and know-how to set this mod up for yourself, you'd do well to get it downloaded and ready, just in case something happens to it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Have Until 2030 to Build a Cyberpunk 2-Ready PC, Polish Analysts Predicts a Late 2030 Release for CDPR’s Estimated $419M Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-cd-projekt-red-2030-polish-firm-predicts/</link>
            <guid>1393786</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We know that the next game we'll see from <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> is <strong>The Witcher 4</strong>, one of the most anticipated games <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/">not at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and a game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">that we probably won't see until 2027</a>. After that, however, is a game that more recent CDPR fans are arguably looking forward to more: Project Orion. Otherwise known as the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, and for now, also known as <strong>Cyberpunk 2</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/">With the way RAM prices are going</a>, if your PC build is already behind on current releases, then you'll want to upgrade as soon as you can to ensure you're ready for The Witcher 4. With more than a year to prepare, that should be enough time to accumulate the parts you need and find a way to pay for them without having to mortgage your house. In the case of Cyberpunk 2? You'll have until 2030, according to Polish analyst firm Noble Securities.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109480/cyberpunk-2-has-a-dollars400-million-budget-and-will-release-in-2030-polish-analyst-firm-predicts/index.html">TweakTown</a>, that's when the firm believes the game will release, with the firm specifically predicting a late 2030 release window. The firm also adds that the game will cost CD Projekt RED a whopping $419 million to make, and that it'll include a multiplayer mode. We've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/">previous reports that Cyberpunk 2 includes a multiplayer mode</a>, though to see it again here adds even more flame to that fire.</p>



<p>"<em>The desire to integrate multiplayer into production prompted us to extend our production time beyond the progress of work on the benchmark W4</em>," said <strong>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski</strong> in an investor's note. "<em>As a result, the budget has increased to PLN 1.5 billion, and we expect the release in Q4 2030 (the 10th anniversary of CP277)."</em></p>



<p>For the sequel to arrive a decade later (and to have the release of The Witcher IV happen in between) would be quite the Cinderella story for CD Projekt RED. Not that the studio was down in the doldrums before Cyberpunk 2077 came out, but for Cyberpunk 2077 to have the release it did, and be fixed over the course of the next three years and have a complete redemption arc. Followed by what is hopefully a well-received release of The Witcher VI, and then the release of the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel would be a hell of a way to close out the decade since Cyberpunk 2077's launch.</p>



<p>Who knows if that's how the story will go, of course. There are also plenty of questions remaining around how multiplayer will be implemented and what exactly that will look like for a game that players would reasonably expect to be focused on a single-player campaign. We'll have to wait and see, but for now, a 2030 release is not at all a bad prediction, considering what we know about where CD Projekt RED's focus is currently being placed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">the fact that work on the sequel is ramping up</a>. </p>
