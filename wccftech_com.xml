			<p>Yesterday, Funcom <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546730385827954775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the detailed PC specifications of their upcoming large scale multiplayer survival game Dune Awakening. There's already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a benchmark (with character creator) available on Steam</a> to test out the expected performance, but these specs will be welcome nonetheless, especially since they anticipate a reasonably optimized game despite the usage of Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> that the game would support NVIDIA DLSS 4, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. Now, Funcom has confirmed that Dune Awakening will also integrate 'the latest open upscaling and advanced frame generation tech from AMD', which would appear to hint at AMD FSR 3 support (FSR 4 is exclusive to the new AMD GPUs) as well as Intel XeSS 2 with XeLL to lower latency.</p>
<p>Additionally, thanks to a partnership with Razer, Dune Awakening integrates Razer Chroma RGB and Razer Sensa HD Haptics, enhancing immersion. The Razer Kraken V4 Pro headset provides synced lighting and intelligent haptic feedback, just like the Freyja Gaming Cushion, which will let you feel the hum of your ornithopter as if you were sitting on it.</p>
<p>The following tweakable settings were confirmed, too:</p>
<p><b>Settings</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Remappable keyboard &amp; mouse controls</li>
<li>Better support for AZERTY/QWERTZ and ESDF users</li>
<li>Subtitles on/off</li>
<li>Subtitle backgrounds</li>
<li>Optional chat indicators or chat bubbles in social areas</li>
<li>Optional loadout hotbar, mini-radial or radial wheel</li>
<li>Controller rumble on/off</li>
<li>Screenshake on/off</li>
<li>Motion blur on/off</li>
<li>FOV adjustment</li>
<li>Framerate limiter</li>
<li>Ultrawide HUD option (21:9 and 32:9)</li>
<li>Multiple audio channel sliders</li>
<li>Multiple sensitivity sliders</li>
</ul>
<p><b>General Gameplay</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Controller support</li>
<li>Dialogue system with path highlights</li>
<li>Audio SFX to support key actions/events</li>
<li>Tutorials with highlighted text</li>

</ul>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening â€” Business Model &amp; Post-Launch Plans Explained" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1B7G2SXBDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Game Director Joel Bylos spoke in a brief video about the business model ahead of the pre-order opening. Dune Awakening will be buy-to-play only, so there won't be any optional subscriptions. Bylos stressed that this won't be an early access launch. That said, Funcom has a long history of supporting games like its MMOs (Anarchy Online is still active 25 years later) and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-age-of-heroes-begins-today-adding-voiced-companions-and-living-player-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Exiles</a>, and the same will happen with this one through a combination of free updates and optional premium DLCs.</p>
<p>There will also be optional Season Passes, which include several DLCs, but the DLCs will also be purchasable separately. Finally, as with most games, there will be five days of advanced access for those who purchase the most expensive editions. Bylos noted that this, however, helps the studio balance server load, ensuring a better experience for everyone. Furthermore, when the game launches for everyone, there will be new servers for those who don't wish to join a server where others have already started progressing.</p>
<p>For our interview with Joel Bylos at a recent event, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-roundtable-qa-privately-hosted-servers-are-under-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to this article</a>. Dune Awakening is out in less than two months on PC, while the console versions will be released at a later date.</p>
