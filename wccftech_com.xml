			<p>A report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/us-consumers-will-cut-back-on-buying">The Game Business</a> as part of the publication's Summer Game Fest event details a presentation from Circana analyst and executive director, Mat Piscatella, who shows how US consumers are pulling back from spending on entertainment areas, video games included, due to the rising cost of essentials like food and shelter, and the potential impact of tariffs on the price of games and other goods.</p>

<iframe title="Tariffs and Affordability: The US Consumer In Limbo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F7-9rr_Cuhk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As a Circana analyst, and with the wide range of industries that Circana collects data from, Piscatella has the ability to see the details in consumer spending in the US, and shows clearly how US consumers are concerned over the impact that tariffs will have on the prices of everything, from essential goods like food to the cost of clothes, and, key to Piscatella's specialization, video games. </p>



<p>Whether people are opposed or in support of tariffs, a clear majority (69%) think that tariffs will result in high costs, The Game Business and Piscatella report. To make up for those rising costs, per Circana's data, 30% of consumers will spend less on video games and entertainment subscriptions, with more of their spending money going towards the essentials, as Circana has also tracked that the average cost of food has gone up 2.3% compared to 2024, the cost of utilities has gone up 15.7%, car insurance has gone up 5.4%, and shelter has gone up 4%.</p>



<p>Since the Trump administration first announced its tariffs in April, the response we've seen from players in the US has been a concern for rising prices. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">paused pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> in the US while it accessed the potential impact of tariffs. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-the-esa-expects-trumps-tariffs-to-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-the-video-game-industry/">ESA expressed its belief that tariffs will have a "<em>detrimental impact on the video game industry</em>,</a>" and even in The Game Business' report this week, expressed that it has been trying to relay to the Trump administration the significance of the video game industry in the US, and how tariffs could negatively impact what is a $59 billion industry in the US alone.</p>



<p>When pre-orders for the Switch 2 were finally announced, the price of the console stayed the same, but the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">cost of accessories went up</a>. There's also still the chance that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">cost of the console will increase due to tariffs</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not just the cost of Nintendo products that has a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">chance of increasing</a>. With costs going up on essentials, and tariffs looming as a greater threat to raise costs further, the downturn that the industry has been in might not end anytime soon.</p>



<p>When Grand Theft Auto VI arrives, it'll be a much-needed shot in the arm for the video game industry, but it remains to be seen how long the impact of that shot will last.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-announces-resident-evil-survival-unit-a-new-mobile-game-that%E2%80%99ll-be-fully-revealed-next-week.1236132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom has announced a new Resident Evil mobile game called Resident Evil Survival Unit. Developers Joycity and Aniplex are leading development on it while working in collaboration with Capcom.</p>



<p>Survival Unit is currently being described as a real-time strategy game, though full details on it are still to come at a <a href="https://www.residentevil-survivalunit.com/en">livestream presentation</a> that'll take place next week on <strong>July 10, 2025, at 3pm PT / 6pm ET / 11pm BST</strong>. We at least know that it'll arrive on iOS and Android devices, and that it'll be available in North America, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Asia.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While a new real-time strategy mobile game might not be the most exciting thing to Resident Evil fans who are just counting the days until <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-open-world-game-before-capcom-realized-it-wasnt-what-fans-wanted-to-see-or-play/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, what is significant about Resident Evil Survival Unit is that the co-creator of the Kingdom Hearts games, Shinji Hashimoto, is behind the game. He even announced the project during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9WogwxRWbI">Anime Expo Lite livestream</a>, where he expressed that its a project he's been working on bringing to light for some time.</p>



<p>"<em>The title offers a fresh take on the 'Resident Evil' universe,</em>" Hashimoto said, "<em>introducing a strategy game system designed specifically for mobile users. While distinct from Capcom's traditional 'Resident Evil' series, it delivers a unique experience that stays true to the essence of the franchise.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft laying off 9,000 people</a> across the company this week, with a significant portion of them coming from its Xbox and gaming business, meant several projects being cancelled before they could see the light of day. One of the more significant cancellations was a game codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">Project Blackbird</a>, and MMORPG from The Elder Scrolls Online developer, ZeniMax Online.</p>



<p>More details about what this MMORPG would have become have been trickling out since news of the layoffs started to break earlier this week, like how recently, development on the project was progressing well despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/">early issues with the game's engine</a>. Microsoft's chief executive officer of its gaming division, <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">Phil Spencer, reportedly loved what ZeniMax Online was creating</a>, even going so far as to needing the controller ripped from his hands in order for a meeting to actually continue. </p>



<p>Clearly, though, not even Spencer's admiration of the game could get in the way of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/">Microsoft's larger AI-driven goals</a>, which are reportedly a key factor behind the cuts. </p>



<p>As far as what Project Blackbird would have become, we've already heard a few details from reports that described it as a third-person shooter that would have had a sci-fi setting, with a major focus on player movement as a key aspect of gameplay, with players having the ability to double-jump, dash, make use of a grapple hook, wall-climb. It was as key to the gameplay as shooting would have been, according to reports we've already heard. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/canceled-xbox-mmo-project-blackbird">True Achievements</a> goes into even deeper detail as to what Blackbird was going to be, describing elements of its story, setting, and gameplay. </p>



<p>True Achievements corroborates what we've already heard, that ZeniMax Online was building a sci-fi setting and a third-person shooter/action game, and further elaborates on the setting, claiming that players would have stepped into the shoes of a type of character called a Revenant, "<em>an operative working for alien syndicates on a remote, tidally locked planet called Soteria</em>."</p>



<p>Soteria was said to have been an ice planet on one side while the other was constantly sweltering under an oppressive sun, with an area in the middle called 'The Twilight Band' that was actually habitable. There was a sentient AI named PAN, a race of aliens who thought they were better than everyone else, various syndicates that players could side with, an aquatic race of aliens, a furry alien race, and a race of aliens that could purge the depths of your mind for secrets. All solid ingredients for the foundation of a sci-fi world.</p>



<p>Missions could involve up to four players, with some larger missions involving up to six players at a time, each dolled out by the various syndicates you could work for. Humans also fit into the story, with the various alien races understandably cautious about humans after a high-ranking alien officer was killed in a human neighborhood. That's where much of Blackbird's "<em>alien noir themes</em>" came from, as you dug into the mystery behind the murder and rose through the ranks of this sci-fi world.</p>



<p>All together, this MMORPG from ZeniMax Online sounds like it would have been something far more expansive than what it had built with The Elder Scrolls Online, which is one of the worlds largest and most successful MMORPGs. There's never a guarantee that any game will be a hit, but everything we've heard about Project Blackbird so far suggests that it was going to be something incredible. Now, its cancellation remains a stain on the legacy of the current Microsoft leadership and their clear inability to manage talented developers and studios.</p>

			<p>Destiny: Rising, the alternate-timeline mobile version of Destiny Bungie has been making alongside publisher NetEase will arrive on iOS and Android devices this coming August 28, 2025, Bungie and NetEase have announced.</p>



<p>The game was first revealed last <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">October</a>, featuring recognizable faces from the Destiny universe, though this new mobile-exclusive version of Bungie's popular FPS doesn't expand on the story Bungie is telling in Destiny 2. Its alternate-timeline setting means a number of lore changes to characters, but more significantly, bringing the game to mobile means gameplay changes, like not being able to craft your own Guardian. </p>

<p>Instead, players can choose between pre-designed heroes from the Destiny universe, like Ikora Rey and Iron Lord Jolder. That said, players do also have the choice of playing as Wolf, a new character and "<em>fully customizable Lightbearer</em>," according to a press release for the game's release date reveal. </p>



<p>Veteran Destiny fans will also feel right at home in Rising with its strike missions, larger-scale six-player PvE missions, and, of course, PvP game modes that let players battle it out against each other. The gameplay shown off in the release date trailer also shows that even on mobile, there's no mistaking it for something other than a game set in the world of Destiny. </p>
