			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-spotted-in-new-datamine/">Insider-Gaming</a>, a datamined leak points to EA hosting an open beta for its next entry in the Battlefield series, which we only know as Battlefield 6 for now, since its official title has yet to be revealed. </p>



<p>While datamining Battlefield Labs, the program through which EA is testing new features for the next Battlefield game and consistently playtesting the new entry, the datamining group 1BF Telegram Group found "<em>Battlefield 6 Open Beta</em>" added in the most recent update, though no further details came with the phrase. </p>



<p>It's not the biggest shock that EA would plan an open beta for its next major shooter, since that's the common pattern for how multiplayer-focused games are launched. The beta not only gives the developers a chance to stress-test the servers, it gives players a chance to get a feel for the game ahead of its proper launch. </p>



<p>We've seen a number of leaks for Battlefield 6, including videos of the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/">Rush Mode</a>, and footage of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/">campaign</a>, and EA has even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">officially shared clips</a> from the Battlefield Labs playtests to show how development is progressing. </p>



<p>A full, proper reveal for the game is all we're missing at this point, which, according to EA, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">due to arrive sometime this summer</a>. It could be that alongside the full reveal, EA will announce the open beta and the dates it'll be live, but for now, we'll have to wait and see. </p>



<p>When the reveal does happen, hopefully, it goes well, as EA reportedly has extremely high expectations for this new shooter. A recent report pointed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">EA executives setting a target of 100 million players</a>. It also claimed that the budget for this new game has hit an eye-watering $400 million, which at least partly explains why EA executives are hoping the game can reach such high player numbers. </p>
