			<p>A new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> lets you play through the game's story in chronological order. That means instead of how the original game is structured, where you play through Ellie's three days in Seattle, followed by Abby's, you'll crisscross between them, jumping back and forth from Ellie to Abby in chronological order. </p>



<p>Anyone who has played The Last of Us Part II will know that this significantly changes how you experience the story. Controversial as it was, part of what made The Last of Us Part II a memorable game was how it challenged players to reflect on their feelings towards Abby in its back half, and to see her as more than just Joel's killer, which is all you know about her from the beginning of the game's story up until you swap to playing as her after the end of Ellie's third day in Seattle.</p>



<p>There's also an extremely significant scene between Ellie and Joel that takes place in Jackson, the day before he dies, that makes for an extremely impactful moment at the end of the game when it is revealed. Now, that scene will come at the very beginning, and like everything else that is getting switched around, it'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how many of the game's powerful moments retain their strength, or lose it, due to this new order. </p>



<p>"<em>Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby's motivations, realizations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines,</em>" writes Jonathan Dornbush, editorial manager at Naughty Dog in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/">PlayStation Blog post</a> announcing the update. </p>



<p>"<em>While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II's themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Through the new chronological mode, we believe players will gain deeper insight into Part II's narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted at guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby's crisscrossing journeys. You'll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more</em>."</p>



<p>The update is out today, on PlayStation and PC, and also includes a number of bug fixes and performance updates. It also includes new skins for Joel and Tommy for the game's No Return mode. Joel gets an outfit making him look like Nathan Drake from Uncharted, while Tommy gets to don the look of Nate's brother, Sam Drake.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you're like me, and don't understand who would want this in the first place after playing the story as it was originally intended to be experienced, then you don't have to fret, since it is an optional mode that you can ignore whenever you return to The Last of Us Part II. And if you've never played The Last of Us Part II before, Naughty Dog still recommends you play it the way it was originally developed, before diving into this new mode.</p>



<p>"<em>It was no small feat to bring The Last of Us Part II's story chronologically together, given that Part II's story is so meticulously put together. We're grateful to the developers both at Naughty Dog and our partners at Nixxes to make the chronological mode as smooth as possible. And while we of course recommend players still new to the game to play through Part II's story as was originally developed, the team's hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter</em>."</p>



<p>You can jump into this new mode once you've downloaded the update, or, if Naughty Dog's history is anything to go by, you can wait until the seemingly inevitable The Last of Us Part II Remastered: Chronological Mode Remake is announced and play it then.</p>

			<p>Xbox Game Pass is reportedly profitable even when factoring in loss sales of first-party titles available on the service, according to a known business journalist.</p>



<p>Providing a clarification on yesterday's statement revealing that Xbox Game Pass is profitable, taking fees paid to third parties, marketing, and service costs into account, but not lost sales of first-party titles, The Game Business founder Chris Dring stated today on <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring">X</a> that the subscription service is profitable even when factoring these lost sales. 18 months ago, the journalist checked with Xbox what's included in the Game Pass P&amp;L, and was told that first-party games have their own P&amp;L separate to Game Pass as they make money via other means, which may have meant that Xbox Game Pass was profitable but potentially also put pressure on the margins for first-party games, possibly with some studios not making much profit, if any at all. All this, however, was before Xbox games started being released on other consoles, as studios can now make more margins on premium sales. Regardless of all the information above, sources have reached out to Chris Dring to confirm that, even if lost sales of first-party titles and related microtranscations are taken into account, Xbox Game Pass is still profitable.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Xbox Game Pass's profitability and the impact it has been having on the industry as a whole have been a point of discussion since the service's launch a few years back. No matter its profitability, the impact in terms of loss sales seems to be big, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">estimated</a> earlier this year that games available via the subscription service can lose has much as 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, as was highlighted by how games like Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Starfield failed to make a real splash on sales charts. On the other hand, a multiplatform game available on Xbox Game Pass can have a beneficial impact, as it can be accompanied by increased sales on another format.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-announced-for-this-thursday-20-minute-gameplay-deep-dive.1238253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-announced-for-july-2025/">announcing</a> that Ghost of Yotei would be getting a dedicated State of Play event sometime this month, PlayStation has announced when that State of Play will happen, and it'll take place just two days from now at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>In a new<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/watch-the-ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive-on-july-10/"> PlayStation Blog post</a>, PlayStation has confirmed that the Ghost of Yotei State of Play will take place this Thursday, July 10, 2025, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST. The presentation will be a 20-minute-long deep-dive on Ghost of Yotei's gameplay, and will feature the creative directors from Sucker Punch, Nate Fox and Jason Connell, discussing the gameplay, and showing off "<em>new weapons, new ways to personalize your journey at the edge of Japan, new special modes, and much more</em>," the blog post reads.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We now have less than 100 days to go from now until Ghost of Yotei's previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">October 2, 2025</a>, release date. The follow-up to Sucker Punch's 2019 samurai epic, Ghost of Tsushima currently carries the full weight of PlayStation's first-party fall lineup, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon was delayed</a> from its original September release date and a new release date for it was not announced. </p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the rest of the major games that'll be available to PlayStation players are coming from third-party developers, though of course, there's still time for PlayStation to announce another first-party title coming before the end of the year. Astro Bot, last year's GOTY at The Game Awards wasn't announced until the midway point of the year. That said, we're already past that, so it'll be interesting to see if Sony does have anything else up its sleeve, or if Ghost of Yotei gets to hog the entire fall/winter spotlight for PlayStation.</p>
