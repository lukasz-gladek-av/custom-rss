			<p>If you're getting stuck into<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677660/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the latest game by MachineGames</a>, you'll know that there is a ton of exploration to do in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. It can be pretty overwhelming. However, there are certain things within the game that will make your life a little bit more manageable so that you don't find yourself getting overwhelmed trying to find every little item in the game. There are side quests that you can undertake if you want more of the story, but of course, they aren't necessary. Here are some top tips for playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle.</p>
<h2>Top Tips For Playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>While you can find guides for pretty much everything in this game online already, you may feel that you want to solve things by yourself with minimal handholding. Luckily, the game has a built-in hint mode, which is achieved by using the camera you are given. When there is something to take a picture of, a camera icon will appear. This is a sign that you can take pictures of certain items, people, or landmarks in this area, which will provide information on what you want to do next. Additionally, they provide Adventure Points, which are key to using Skill Books.</p>
<p>Skill Books are also a great way to give you an advantage in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, as they can upgrade your abilities. They can also upgrade Indiana's strength, health, and stamina. You can get Adventure Points in a variety of ways by exploring and collecting them, such as taking pictures and finding collectibles in the game. By doing so and being thorough in your exploration, you can rack up Adventure Points pretty fast.</p>
<p>Stealth is a huge part of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Of course, you don't have to be stealthy in the game if you don't want to, as you can choose to fight your way through the enemies. However, if you do choose to be stealthy, it will show up on your HUD that there is a little eye that shows you're being watched. This is helpful if you're trying to be sneaky around specific areas and trying to loot everything you see depending on what clearance you have in the area (depending on the costume Indiana Jones is wearing). This eyeball icon doesn't necessarily mean that they are suspicious of you, but they will be if you steal from them directly in front of them.</p>
<p>Looting food and bandages is key to your survival in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, regardless of what difficulty you play it. You never know when you're going to take damage or when things will get dicey. Food can help replenish stamina, which you may need if you're in a lot of difficult fights. Additionally, you can get your hands on Medicine Bottles to exchange with an NPC in Vatican City. Using this item will provide you with a permanent boost to your health and stamina.</p>
<p>These are some tips that will help you survive and explore Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Good luck out there, adventurer.

			<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim may have celebrated its thirteenth birthday around a month ago, but its modding community is more alive than ever. The last few days brought several exciting developments, starting with the long-awaited release of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Shaders 1.0</a>, a plugin that introduces advanced graphics features to the open world roleplaying game.</p>
<p>Historically, Boris Vorontsov's ENB has been the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-visuals-natural-culminated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go-to graphics enhancement framework for Skyrim</a> and many other PC games. However, at least when it comes to Bethesda's best-selling game, CS 1.0 has arguably surpassed it with the latest release, mainly due to the introduction of PBR - also known as Physically Based Rendering.</p>
<p>PBR was a major advancement that was introduced to new games in late 2015 and early 2016. One of the first titles to adopt physically based rendering <a href="http://wccftech.com/the-division-features-pbr-dynamic-gi-realtime-bounce-lighting-completely-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was Ubisoft Massive's Tom Clancy The Division</a>. With PBR, materials are realistically influenced by lighting, making for a dramatic visual improvement.</p>
<p>While main Community Shaders modder doodlum (the same author of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-light-mod-greatly-improves-visuals-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light Limit Fix mod</a> that backported Starfield's clustered shading to introduce limitless dynamic light sources to Skyrim) worked on this major new release, some of the most active texture modders began adapting their work to the new graphics feature. I'm told by <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RealExist?gameId=1704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RealExist</a>, one of the texture modders who already produced several PBR mods, that it was not easy as the game's lighting did not work well at first with PBR (it was not built for it, after all). The modders also had to come up with a mesh patcher (<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ParallaxGen</a>) that enables meshes to be compatible with the new PBR textures.</p>
<p>As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, so you can take a look at the first examples below, with several mods already available on Nexus and others to follow.</p>

<p>Community Shaders 1.0 added more than just PBR to Skyrim. The full changelog <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/9415" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by doodlum on Nexus mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>'extremely higher performance' when using the aforementioned Light Limit Fix</li>
<li>deferred rendering for global illumination, reflections, and subsurface scattering</li>
<li>native support for DLAA and Native FSR 3.1 AA</li>
<li>improved shadow rendering performance and quality</li>
<li>optimized subsurface scattering</li>
<li>optimized parallax</li>
<li>improved water reflections</li>
<li>improved water performance</li>
<li>optimized water parallax</li>
<li>directional shadows support for water and all transparent objects, such as eyes and glass</li>
<li>significantly optimized (up to 16x faster) Dynamic Cubemaps</li>
<li>optimized Water Caustics</li>
<li>improved grass shading model</li>
<li>improved grass SSS and SSS on foliage, glaciers, etc.</li>
<li>significantly improved particle light scalability</li>
<li>new contact shadows algorithm</li>
<li>unlocked internal game HDR rendering</li>
<li>massively increased SSR (screen space reflections) visibility and range</li>
<li>redone wetness and puddle build-up that is now consistent across Skyrim saves</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>There's more. CS 1.0 also supports <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135817" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrain Shadows</a>, a new feature developed by modder ProfJack that enables rough terrain shadows with infinite distance, both in Skyrim and on the game's world map. You can check out a preview in the impressive GIF above.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Community Shaders 1.0 supports <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127557" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light Placer</a>, the latest framework developed by powerofthree, the author of several key frameworks for Skyrim (Spell Perk Item Distributor, Base Object Swapper, and Keyword Item Distributor, to name a few). With Light Placer, modders can manually add real light bulbs with unlimited range and brightness to actors and objects. These lights can flicker, affect detection, change color based on the time of day, and so on. Light Placer has great potential to improve lighting by allowing modders to add many more lights across the whole game (and its many content mods, potentially) as they see fit.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 is far from the final release of Community Shaders. The authors are already testing new big features such as Screen Space Global Illumination (SSGI), Skylighting, Cloud Shadows, proper support for HDR displays, built-in Frame Generation, Capsule Shadows/Ambient Occlusion, sharper textures when using anti-aliasing, and more.</p>
<p>I plan to delve deeper into the realm of Skyrim modding soon. Stay tuned for a much more detailed article on everything that's going on in this vibrant mod scene.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-stalling-vision-pro-sales-prompt-partnership-with-sony-to-add-playstation-vr2-controller-support.1055238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/apple-partnership-with-sony-for-playstation-vr2-controller-support-for-vision-pro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It was recently reported that Apple has <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-vision-pro-recorded-less-than-500000-units-buyers-are-not-using-it/">only sold 500,000 units</a> of the Vision Pro since its launch in February, and it appears that the company is aware of it and exploring ways to enhance sales. A new report claims that the company is expanding the Vision Pro headset use case by potentially partnering with Sony for its VR Gaming Controller support. The partnership has been in the works for several months now, and Sony's VR controllers will be available to users as optional accessories.</p>
<h2>Apple and Sony are working to bring PlayStation VR2 controller support to the Vision Pro</h2>
<p>The news was shared by Mark Gurman in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro">Power On newsletter</a>, stating that Apple will diversify the list of accessories for the Vision Pro by introducing support for Sony's VR controllers. The analyst also noted that Apple's handset supports the PlayStation 5 and Xbox controllers, but they are not optimized for the augmented reality experience. Sony's VR controller, on the other hand, is designed to take advantage of a virtual reality user experience and would go along with Vision Pro's essence.</p>
<p>The PlayStation and Xbox controllers lack the 6DOF or the six degrees of freedom required for precise VR gaming controls. Sony would have to make some changes to its product distribution strategy if it goes ahead with Apple's plans, requiring it to offer the PlayStation VR2 controller separately, as it is currently bundled with the company's headset. Apple could offer the controllers directly though its online stores and its retail outlets.</p>
<p>It brings us to question whether Apple is aiming to market the Vision Pro as a dedicated gaming headset. While it should head that road, the PlayStation VR2 controller will enhance productivity tasks as well as aid in media editing in visionOS, according to Mark Gurman. However, it will also serve its true purpose - gaming on the Vision Pro, which has been a hit or miss at this point. Nonetheless, it will make it easier for users to control and navigate the operating system using the thumb sticks and the directional pad. The finger pinch gesture could be replaced by the trigger button.</p>
<p>At this stage, it remains to be seen if the two companies have sealed the deal, and if so, there are no official statements on when we can expect the company to add support for the controller. Apple is aiming to expand its market for the Vision Pro, and offering support for the PlayStation VR2 controller could allow the device to extend its reach. We will share additional details on the matter, so do stick around.</p>
