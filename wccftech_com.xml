			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod released today introduces a new handy feature that allows players to add more characters to their active combat party, including those not normally available and that never actually join the party during the course of the game.</p>
<p>The Party Mod Menu, developed by Braklinath and now available for download on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/530?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, adds an in-game menu to change the party members that participate in battle, making it possible to make every available character an active combat character, change the party leader and add characters that do not join the party during the course of the game, including Sephiroth, Zack, Cid, and Vincent. Having any of these four characters in the party, however, can lead to issues outside of combat, and even in combat, as the game even locks up if either Cid or Vincent are in the active combat party, which is not surprising since the two characters were never meant to be playable in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. In case you want to check out how the mod works before downloading it, you can watch a video showcase provided by the mod's developer below.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds comes on consoles with some evident technical issues, and it seems like even on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game's performance and image quality are disappointing, with bad PSSR implementation to boot.</p>
<p>French outlet <a href="https://www.gamersyde.com/news_gsy_preview_monster_hunter_wilds_sur_ps5_pro-23907_fr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamerSyde</a> recently posted an early analysis of the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game, highlighting how the game on the premium Sony hardware still forces players to choose between different display modes and how Resolution mode still targets 30 FPS without any option to disable ray tracing for additional performance without providing a true 4K experience, as this mode uses PSSR to upscale a native resolution of 3072 x 1728p to 4K. Even with the additional raw power offered by the PlayStation 5 Pro, Resolution mode still cannot keep a steady 30 FPS, with frequent drops that the outlet thinks are caused by incorrect frame pacing.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Balanced and Performance modes on PlayStation 5 Pro are also quite disappointing. The former targets a slightly lower resolution than Resolution mode, 2496 x 1404p, with again no option to disable ray tracing, which makes the framerate jump way too much, resulting in a far from optimal experience even on a VRR display and uneven image quality. Performance mode, on the other hand, manages to hit its 60 FPS target, but at a huge cost in terms of image quality, as PSSR struggles to upscale to 4K resolution properly from the mode's 1080p resolution, delivering unstable image quality, especially in areas with a lot of vegetation, bad texture quality and more. As such, it definitely looks like the game is a few patches away from delivering a solid experience on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't seem to run well on <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-720p-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any format</a>, as the game is a more than worthy new entry in the series thanks to its new combat mechanics and a more streamlined experience that makes it easier than ever to remain on the field going from hunt to hunt without having to return to base camp too often. You can learn more about the game in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>Bloober Team, the development studio behind the excellent Silent Hill 2 remake, confirmed its collaboration with Konami will continue with a new game that is currently in development.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on its<a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website</a>, the Polish development team confirmed they are continuing their partnership with Konami, announcing the signing of a new agreement for a joint project. This new project is based on an unspecified Konami IP. Like with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami will once again be the new game's publisher and rights holder.</p>
<p>While neither the Silent Hill 2 remake developer nor Konami has added any hint as to which IP the new project will be based on, as Bloober Team is known to be a horror games developer, there's a very good chance the Polish studio will be working on the series again. While a remake of the iconic first entry in the series would be quite welcome by many, myself included, it would also be interesting to see what Bloober would do with the franchise if given the freedom to develop a new entry in the series.</p>
<p>No matter what Bloober Team will do, the studio has proved it has what it takes to create an extremely compelling horror experience with the Silent Hill 2 remake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/idxbox-fanfest-reveals-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-date-lies-of-p-overture-trailer-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Yesterday, during the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8FrLCDS3hY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase, </a>which was held in partnership with IGN, Microsoft unveiled several news tidbits from third-party developers.</span></p>
<p>Arguably, the most important was the announcement of the release date for Revenge of the Savage Planet. This is the sequel to Journey to 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, which earned a positive reception, including an <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10 score here on Wccftech</a> from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Anybody pining for more Metroid Prime needs to put Journey to the Savage Planet at the top of their list. The game has a few rough edges and its sense of humor might not be to all tastes, but it captures that inviting, adventuresome Metroid spirit better than anything I’ve played in a while. This Savage Planet will pull you into its orbit if you give it half a chanc</em>e.</p>
<p>However, getting a sequel going wasn't easy at all for the developers. Typhoon Studios was acquired by Google shortly prior to the game's release, but in early 2021, following Google's divestiture from its Stadia initiative, the studio was shut down alongside others. Later that year, former members of Typhoon, including Game Director and Writer Alex Hutchinson, established a new developer called Raccoon Logic and were able to secure the rights from Google to produce a sequel. Revenge of the Savage Planet launches on May 8 for Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC, and will be included with Game Pass on day one.</p>

<p>Another big news story from the ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase was the new trailer for Lies of P: Overture, the highly anticipated DLC for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed Soulslike game</a>. In this expansion, players encounter a mysterious artifact that transports them back to Krat in its final days of grandeur. In the shadow of an impending tragedy, their mission is to explore the past and uncover its dark secrets, haunted by surprises, loss, and vengeance. The developer says the choices made will ripple through the past and present in the world of Lies of P, revealing hidden truths and leaving lasting consequences. Lies of P: Overture <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch this Summer</a>.</p>

<p>The ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase also included several other announcements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balatro has dropped on Game Pass</li>
<li>Tron: Catalyst, in development at Bithell Games, launches on June 17</li>
<li>Jump Ship, an intriguing sci-fi first-person cooperative game that mixes spaceship combat and on-foot sections, will debut this Summer on early access (including Xbox Game Preview)</li>
<li>Descenders Next launches on April 9 and will be on Game Pass</li>
