			<p>Just weeks after Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">unveiled its new subsidiary with Tencent to be Vantage Studios</a>, which will house the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises, and be co-led by Charlie Guillemot (son of Yves Guillemot, chief executive officer at Ubisoft) and Christophe Derennes, the current head of the Assassin's Creed series, Marc-Alexis Côté has left Ubisoft.</p>



<p>This news was first reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">IGN</a>, which reports that staff were alerted to Côté's departure today through an internal email that also included details regarding "<em>the need for Vantage Studios' leadership team to be aligned with its core goals</em>." The report adds that Côté was offered a role within Vantage Studios, but declined to take it.</p>



<p>The report also included a statement attributed to a Ubisoft spokesperson (which Ubisoft also sent to Wccftech, confirming Côté's departure), which reads, "<em>Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025, Marc-Alexis Côté</em> <em>has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we're confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis Côté</em> <em>has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin's Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavours.</em>"</p>



<p>Marc-Alexis Côté had been with Ubisoft for 20 years and first began working on the Assassin's Creed franchise in 2009. Since then, he's been a part of the series every step of the way, from the conceptual beginnings of each title to its execution. He's worked on the series as a level designer, game director, creative director, and since March 2022, he's overseen the development of the entire franchise. </p>



<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for further clarification on the nature of the roles Marc-Alexis Côté was offered, and if he would have been able to be in a similar position at the head of the Assassin's Creed franchise, had he accepted. We'll update this story if/when we hear back.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is already playable on PC and Android devices via emulators like EDEN.</p>



<p>As showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">tabeneru</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases">EDEN emulator</a> can run the new entry in the popular series launching this week worldwide on PC and even Android devices rather well with the appropriate settings. </p>



<p>On PC, users don't even need a high-end system to run the game at the native 30FPS cap, as the user's system, powered by an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU, which is far from being the fastest system configuration, has no trouble running the game smoothly, at least in the shown segment. However, a high-end system is required to push the emulated Switch release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A past its resolution and framerate cap on PC with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44SLbqzH04M&amp;t=2s">the first mod that allows up to 4K at 60 FPS gameplay</a> shared by Youtube user FRANC225. </p>

<p>Although Pokémon Legends: Z-A has yet to officially release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leak-online-early-builds-pokedex-more/">early copies of the game already reached the hands of players</a>, so it's not surprising to see the game already emulated on PC. However, this ability to emulate new titles may soon change. As development shifts to the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusively, it is widely expected that it will take a long time before an effective emulator for the new console becomes available on PC.</p>
