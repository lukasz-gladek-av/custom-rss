			<p>Gaijin Entertainment, the studio behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-tracing-qa-fsr4-omm-ser-support-coming-soon/">War Thunder,</a> Modern Warships, Aces of Thunder, and MWT: Tank Battles, has announced EdenSpark, a new open-source platform where, along with an AI assistant, users can create games and make them accessible "<em>to console users hassle-free</em>" and "<em>truly own the code of their creations</em>."</p>



<p>The trailer frames EdenSpark as the platform that simplifies the game-making process with "<em>easy 3D modelling</em>," whatever that's supposed to mean, and that, with the help of its simplified toolset and AI assistant, you can "<em>create a game, and play it instantly on consoles</em>." </p>



<p><a href="https://gaijinent.com/news/edenspark-will-open-a-new-path-for-indie-developers-on-consoles">A blog post</a> on Gaijin Entertainment's official website speaks a little more clearly about EdenSpark, though the framing is generally the same, as EdenSpark is described as a new platform "<em>designed to lower the barriers to game development</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>EdenSpark gives individual game creators an easy access to consoles, even without a registered company or costly legal paperwork. Anyone will be able to turn their idea into a game and share it with friends on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox</em>," Gaijin Entertainment writes. </p>



<p>"<em>At the same time, unlike closed ecosystems offering similar experiences, EdenSpark developers will retain full ownership of their games. This means that creators can keep their projects inside EdenSpark's community or, if they wish, self-publish independently, taking their work anywhere. This combination of accessibility and freedom is unique: major engines might offer professional flexibility, but they either don't help you [bring your game] to console audience fast and easy or are not available under FOSS, or neither. EdenSpark bridges the gap</em>."</p>



<p>Essentially, it seems like EdenSpark is a platform that users will be able to create games on their PC or console, and begin playing the game they just made, something akin to MediaMolecule's Dreams. It seems to go further, though, because it's not all one stylistic look, and if you wanted to take that game and properly publish it on the PlayStation or Xbox store, you'd be able to do just that.</p>



<p>So, if all you wanted to do was make a game and have people play it on their consoles, EdenSpark purports to be able to do that. But it's unclear if users will be able to monetize their games on EdenSpark, or if they'd have to self-publish in order to make money selling the games they made with EdenSpark. It's also unclear if, even with Gaijin Entertainment repeatedly saying that users will "<em>own</em>" the code their games are built on, Gaijin Entertainment would still ask for a cut of any profits made from games created on its platform.</p>



<p>It also seems like the AI assistant is a huge part of EdenSpark achieving its goal to "<em>lower the barriers to game development</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Experienced</em> <em>programmers can dive deep into code, while complete newcomers can rely on AI-assisted tools to generate art, sound, and gameplay logic, or simply build worlds using plain prompts. It's even possible to create games using a retail console</em>,<em> with a keyboard being the only extra accessory you'll need</em>. <em>EdenSpark is powered by Gaijin's Dagor Engine, the proven technology powering blockbuster titles such as War Thunder, Enlisted and Active Matter, ensuring professional-grade performance for projects of any scale</em>."</p>



<p>At some point in November 2025, Gaijin Entertainment will host a closed beta where users in the beta can take a look at several "<em>game prototypes</em>" and play around with EdenSpark before it launches into its 1.0 version sometime in Summer 2026, according to the <a href="https://edenspark.io/en">roadmap on the platform's official website</a>. The AI assistant for EdenSpark will also only be available in its 1.0 launch.</p>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark is more than just another game creation kit,</em>" added Anton Yudintsev, Gaijin Entertainment's co-founder. "<em>It’s the first platform that truly opens consoles to solo developers, while guaranteeing they remain the owners of their games. Whether you want to share a funny prototype with friends or build a real career as an independent studio, EdenSpark gives you both the tools and the freedom.”</em></p>



<p>At this point, it's too early to say with confidence if EdenSpark will be anything of note in the games industry or not. There are already free game-making platforms that let people jump into game development with plenty of tutorials and assistance to help make it as easy as possible. EdenSpark claims to be a new level of ease-of-use, partly because you can use it on any PlayStation or Xbox console you'd grab at your local retailer, instead of having to swing for a development kit.</p>



<p>It's not a bad concept, realistically, there are just a lot of variables left unanswered, like if EdenSpark will let users monetize the games they make within the EdenSpark ecosystem, whether Gaijin Entertainment would ask for a cut of profits for games made with EdenSpark that do get self-published, and perhaps most importantly, how easy to use EdenSpark really is, and if users really could create games that hit the necessary quality bar that makes players want to pay for them. Or, if EdenSpark becomes the new home for anyone looking to make the kinds of AI-slop games we already see filling digital storefronts, only now they get churned out even faster than before.</p>
