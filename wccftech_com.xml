			<p>It's not long until the long-awaited release of the next installment in the Dragon Age franchise. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is just around the corner, with a release date of October 31. To celebrate the game being in a countdown period, EA and BioWare revealed the official launch trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The trailer is just over two minutes long and showcases some of the enemies that players can expect to encounter. The trailer is comprised of gameplay and in-game cinematics to show those interested in the game what they could be experiencing by playing the upcoming title.</p>
<p>To get people excited, it showcases the darkspawn, blighted dragons, and some of the treacherous choices Rook will have to make alongside their companions, which could have a lasting effect on their relationship. Rook and their companions are on a long, perilous journey to defy the gods, which will have consequences depending on their actions. In this game,<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-speaks-on-how-balancing-reappearing-characters-and-solas-role-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/"> Solas is front and center</a>, which is a first for the franchise. Solas was first introduced in Dragon Age: Inquisition and had one of the biggest plot twists in the franchise, which led up to Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
