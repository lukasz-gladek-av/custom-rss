			<p>The Relic: First Guardian, an upcoming Soulslike action RPG, received a new gameplay trailer on Friday. Developed by South Korean studio Project Cloud Games and published by Perp Games, the title is due to launch later this year on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827820/The_Relic_First_Guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, on PlayStation 5, and on Xbox Series S|X. It was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/its-soulslike-galore-at-gamescom-2021-with-project-relic-soulstice-and-dolmen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> as Project Relic at Gamescom 2021. However, back then, it was unveiled as a multiplayer title. It appears that has since changed, as it's now listed as a single player game.</p>
<p>Players will embark on a heroic adventure as the last Guardian to save the world from darkness. The once-prosperous Arsiltus has been swallowed up by the void created by the destruction of the great relic and turned into a land of death. The hero's goal is to gather the pieces of the shattered Great Relic and close the Void.</p>
<p>The developers have described The Relic: First Guardian as a semi-open world action RPG where players will explore an apocalyptic fantasy world and enjoy a variety of action-packed experiences. They'll get to pick between five different types of weapon options, and each weapon has its own unique abilities that can be changed to suit their play style.</p>

<p>There won't be a traditional roleplaying game inspired leveling system. The developers have instead based the game's character progression entirely on runes, items, and crafting. These rewards will be obtained by completing dungeons and defeating bosses.</p>

			<p>Valve's Steam platform continues to grow, <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching</a> a historic milestone today at 14:00 UTC: 40.2 million online users, 12.7 million of which were playing a game. The biggest PC gaming platform has registered steady growth over the past year; let's recap the previous records below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 8, 2024 – 39.2 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 23, 2024 - 38.3 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-37-2-million-concurrent-players-breaking-all-previous-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August 26, 2024 - 37.2 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-another-record-with-36-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 15, 2024 - 36.3 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-record-with-over-34-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mar 2, 2024 - 34.2 million online users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-top-concurrent-player-number-record-nearing-34-million-connected-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 7, 2024 - 33.6 million online users</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The growth trend is crystal clear for everyone to see, showing that Epic's efforts with their own PC store did not in any way impact Valve's Steam. That said, the Epic Games Store is also growing. Just a couple of weeks ago, Epic <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-released-players-spend-2-68-billion-hours-playing-third-party-pc-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the updated figures, such as over 295 million accounts (+25 million compared to last year), 67 million monthly users on average in 2024 (+6%) and 32 million daily users on average (also +6%), and 7.72 billion gameplay hours spent in 2024.</p>
<p>It's obvious that PC gaming is as healthy as it's ever been, which is great news for gamers. Wider audiences inevitably lead to better-performing games from a commercial standpoint. For example, Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> 1.38 million concurrent users on Steam alone, no doubt making Japanese developer and publisher CAPCOM very happy so far with their latest game release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-reaches-steams-top-5-all-time-peak-but-user-reviews-are-only-at-54/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is off to an amazing start, at least in terms of Steam numbers. CAPCOM's latest entry in the monster hunting franchise has literally crushed the player concurrency peaks registered by the two previous (and already highly successful) entries, Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, which stopped at 334K and 231K concurrent users, respectively.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has just <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 1.38 million concurrent users, over a million more than Monster Hunter World, which is enough to place it in Steam's all-time Top 5, behind only PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, Black Myth: Wukong, Palworld, and Counter-Strike 2, and just ahead of the free-to-play action RPG Lost Ark. A new concurrency peak may well be registered later today, although it's unlikely it'd be enough to surpass Counter-Strike 2's record of 1.8 million concurrent players.</p>
<p>Having said that, user reception on Steam is far from optimal. The average user review score is just 54%, a far cry from the 89% average score of Monster Hunter World and the 82% average score of Monster Hunter Rise. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> touched upon the reasons for this: the low challenge level and poor PC performance.</p>
<p><em>What most players are never going to get used to is performance, at least on PC. Just as the system requirements and the benchmark tool suggested, performance is really all over the place, reaching an acceptable level of smoothness only with Frame Generation. [...] In the heat of the hunt, I did not notice the frame rate drops too often, but watching the recording, in reality, it was very choppy instead. So, if you don't have a top-of-the-line machine, you may have to drop most settings and resolution to hit 60 FPS, which is the bare minimum for a game like this. Following the game and Dragon's Dogma 2, it's quite clear how the RE Engine may not have all it takes to handle open-world experiences properly.</em></p>
<p>Both areas can definitely be worked on post-launch by the developers, which could lead to a drastic increase in the game's average user score on Steam. However, if Dragon's Dogma 2 is any indication, that game's equally poor performance did not significantly improve post-release. It seems like the developers may still have work to be done at an engine level to make sure the RE Engine runs well in open world games like Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can try user-made mods and see if they make a positive difference to your gameplay experience. For instance, Nexus user Darex2094 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found improvements</a> in the game's stuttering by replacing the Direct Storage.dll file with the latest version.</p>
