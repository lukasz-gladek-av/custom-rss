            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv%E2%80%99s-2025-roadmap-unveiled-%E2%80%93-new-expansion-in-2026.1158822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has announced the roadmap for <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lets-you-claim-boss-powers-for-yourself-next-season-ptr-opens-today/">Diablo IV</a>, as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/"> Age of Hatred</a> continues for the rest of the year, with the next big expansion for Diablo IV not coming until sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Diablo IV started 2025 with the current season, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-witchcraft-adds-the-armory-witchy-powers-and-a-new-storyline-on-the-tree-of-whispers/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, which will come to an end later this month, with the Belial's Return season picking up the baton. Following that will be the Sins of the Horadrim season, and then closing out the year will be the Infernal Chaos season.</p>
<p>Each will bring a new set of limited updates that players can grab before they're gone, along with permanent additions to the game, like new lair bosses coming in the Belail's Return season, and new nightmare dungeon activities in the Sins of the Horadrim season.</p>
<p>The latter will also be when players on consoles will be able to plug in their keyboard and mouse setups, as support for that control scheme on consoles will arrive sometime this summer. There will also be new collaborations with other series in both the Belial's Return season and the Infernal Chaos season, and the former will likely feature a few special add-ons as Blizzard celebrates Diablo IV's two-year anniversary.</p>
<p>Of course, the new expansion that'll be coming in 2026 will be what brings the most change to the game when it arrives next year. The first major expansion for Diablo IV, Vessel of Hatred, arrived a little over a year after the game's original release. This new expansion is spreading that time difference further, so it'll be interesting to see how players react to it once they see how much bigger, or smaller, it is from the last one.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Diablo-IV-2025-Roadmap.png"></a></figure>

<p>For now, Blizzard teases that the new Diablo IV expansion will include leaderboards and a new ranking system. According to the roadmap image Blizzard showed off, that's about all we know about the expansion, which you can check out for yourself above.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">Metal Eden</a> is an upcoming single-player FPS game from developer Reikon Games and publisher Deep Silver. It will launch on May 6, 2025, and today, a free demo was released so players can try the game for themselves.</p>
<p>Players will be able to check out the opening two missions of the sci-fi shooter "<em>for an unlimited period from today</em>," the studio wrote in a press release. So, even after the game is out, you'll be able to give it a try before buying and jumping into the full game. The demo is available on all platforms the game will release on, so you can head to your PC, PS5 or Xbox Series X/S to install the demo now.</p>
<p>A brand-new trailer for the game was also released alongside the new demo, which shows off how the game evokes shooters like Titanfall with its movement system and futuristic weapons arsenal.</p>

<p>While you can just jump into the demo and give the game a try ahead of its release, if you feel like your skills are up for it and you like Metal Eden well enough, you can try your hand at taking home a chunk of the $1,000 prize pot being offered by Speedrun.com for the fastest demo time.</p>
<p>The challenge is live now on <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/challenges/9x32q3l6-Metal_Eden-metal-eden-demo-speedrun-challenge">Speedrun.com</a> and will run for the next seven days, after which point moderators will take their time to verify the results before dolling out the prize money to the players with the top three fastest times. 1st place takes home $500, 2nd place gets $300, and 3rd place gets the last $200.</p>
<p>Metal Eden will arrive on Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series S/X, and PC on May 6, 2025. Are you looking forward to checking out this game? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hades 2 Will Be A Nintendo Switch And Switch 2 Console Exclusive At Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch.1158687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even though it's been in early access for almost a year now, at time of writing, the full release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-second-update-tweaks-major-core-combat-mechanics/">Hades 2</a>, set to arrive sometime later this year, is easily one of the most anticipated releases for 2025.</p>
<p>However, just like the launch of the original Hades, players on Xbox and PlayStation consoles will have to wait to play the full release. During a Creator's Voice video from Nintendo published on Tuesday, Supergiant Games confirmed that Hades 2 will be a Nintendo console-exclusive game at launch.</p>
<p>That means when it arrives at the still unannounced release date, it'll be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. If you don't have any of those devices and only play on a PlayStation or Xbox console, you'll have to wait a little longer to check out the full release of Hades 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hades 2 was one of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">third-party games confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 direct last week, though it was not confirmed to be one of the launch titles for the console, as we're still without a release date for the full game.</p>
<p>It arrived on PC in early access on May 6, 2024, and at the time of writing, that one-year anniversary is less than a month away. It wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we didn't have to wait too much longer to hear more about when the 1.0 version of Hades 2 is ready to release.</p>
<p>The original Hades spent almost two years in early access, and while it's entirely plausible the same could happen here, all signs point to Hades 2 being ready for its full launch far ahead of that timeline.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is the first sequel Supergiant Games has ever done, with each of its previous projects being one-and-done titles that have all added to its mythical status as an indie developer that simply does not miss. Early access players are already loving Hades 2 and can't wait for the full release. It is almost surely a lock for one of the games that'll be a part of 2025's Game of the Year conversation.</p>
