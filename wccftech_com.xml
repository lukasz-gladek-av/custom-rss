			<p>With just a few hours left before the official launch of the game <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> announced that the PC version will include support for <strong>DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong>, as well as, of course, for all the linked technologies: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>



<p>According to NVIDIA, owners of a <strong>GeForce RTX 50 Series</strong> graphics card can expect to see their frame rates boosted by an average of <strong>3X</strong> at <strong>4K</strong> with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation enabled (and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode). At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 MFG <strong>enables most GeForce RTX GPUs to reach the in-game maximum threshold of 480 frames per second</strong>, though that's not particularly surprising given that the game is also made for mobile devices (and PlayStation 5). With all this performance headroom, it should be a no-brainer for everyone to activate the <strong>second-generation DLSS Super Resolution Transformer model</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ces-2026-demo-footage-nvidia-dlss-4-5-dynamic-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA unveiled at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> to obtain improved visual quality. For the time being, you'll have to do it via the NVIDIA app, though native in-game support is also in development by Arknights: Endfield developer <strong>HYPERGRYPH</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game is a <strong>free-to-play action RPG</strong> with some simulation features thrown in for good measure. You can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfield-beta-test-ii-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's hands-on preview and bonus developer interview here</a>, while the system requirements are available below. The PC version isn't on Steam, by the way; you can only download the game via the official website's launcher or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arknightsendfield-f0f167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond the Arknights: Endfield news, NVIDIA also shared that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Styx: Blades of Greed</a></strong> supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, too, both in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-demo-out-now-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC demo that's currently out</a> and in the full game, due on February 19. Once again, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-super-resolution-how-to-guide-image-quality-analysis-performance-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution</a> can be enabled through the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Moon Studios will release the much-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-update-gameplay-trailer-moon-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong> co-op update</a>. The game already natively supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA, and now players can also upgrade to the second-gen Transformer model (DLSS 4.5) through the NVIDIA app for enhanced fidelity, especially when using the Performance and Ultra Performance modes.</p>



<p>Lastly, the indie open world co-op survival game <strong>The Gold River Project</strong>, due to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253220/The_Gold_River_Project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will be released with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, with the option to enable DLSS 4.5 in the NVIDIA app.</p>

			<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> went through a <strong>deep identity crisis</strong> following the glorious 16-bit entries in the series. The transition to <strong>3D gameplay</strong> wasn't smooth at all, and the <strong>many experiments conducted by Team Sonic weren't always successful.</strong> </p>



<p>2022's <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sonic Frontier</em> is, in my opinion, among those experiments that</strong> <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">succeeded,</strong></a> as, even with some issues, the game did a great job <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">capturing the spirit of the franchise</strong> while trying to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">push the formula in a new direction</strong>. SEGA and Team Sonic, apparently, share my sentiment.</p>



<p><strong>Known and reliable insider Nate the Hate</strong>, who has an <strong>excellent track record</strong> with many early reveals (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">including the Switch 2 official announcement date last year</a></strong>) <strong><a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013707082789237065#m">replied to an X user question</a></strong> regarding the <strong>next entry in the Sonic the Hedgehog series</strong>. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Did you like Frontiers?</em>" the leaker replied, leaving <strong>little doubt about the direction of the yet-to-be-announced game.</strong></p>



<p>While the game is generally regarded as a solid entry in the series, the community seems divided on a hypothetical <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sonic Frontiers 2</em>. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Hopefully the artstyle is more cartoonish. Frontiers felt too much like one of those "Mario in UE5" type videos,"</em> said Reddit user KittenDecomposer96 on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qif3a7/natethehate_seemingly_says_the_next_sonic_game/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a></strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"I really felt like they dropped Sonic on a generic UE5 terrain and randomly sprinkled some Sonic elements over the place,"</em> agreed Phos-Lux, echoing the wider community sentiment.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The evolution of Sonic Frontiers' open-world gameplay</strong>, however, is making other fans <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">excited</strong> about the possibilities. <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"They could make it open world and connect the areas, let us actually see Sonic's world properly,</em>" said Phos-Lux, highlighting well what Team Sonic could do for the next entry in the series.</p>



<p>As the identity crisis I mentioned above often led Team Sonic to almost completely discard gameplay formulas in favor of others, I would definitely welcome the developer <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">iterating on and improving the Frontiers open-world formula</strong>. While the game's plot justified the generic visual identity of the open world, I couldn't help by wonder how much better the game would have been if it had the colorful cartoonish visuals that have defined the series, no matter the quality of each game.</p>



<p>Regardless of how the next Sonic the Hedgehog game will play, it hopefully won't take much longer to know <strong>what's next for the franchise. </strong>2026 marks the series' <strong>35th Anniversary</strong>, and its celebrations would be perfect to unveil what's next for it.</p>
