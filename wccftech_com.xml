            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-pc-improvements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1</a> will introduce some PC-specific improvements, including a reduction of VRAM usage that should lead to better stability.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Director Yuya Tokuda shared a new message on the game's <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> providing additional information on Title Update 1 launching later this week, as well as on future additions, which include the introduction in late May of Tempered Monsters (★8) Gore Magala and the apex predators Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad as well as some balance tweaks that will make them more resilient, like increased health and resistance to wounding, balance adjustments to weapons and mantles, more quality of life improvements and more.</p>
<p>The biggest news for PC players, however, is the confirmation that this week's update will introduce improvements such as a reduction in VRAM usage and an upgrade to DirectStorage's latest version, which should result in an overall improvement in stability. In addition, the team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible, so the PC version should see more improvements in the future.</p>
<p>At the end of today's message, the Monster Hunter Wilds director also teased some more changes coming in the future, such as changes to the gameplay flow and the introduction of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-highly-requested-feature/">Layered Weapons</a>. This will be quite welcome, as the powerful Artian weapons don't look all that good&nbsp;compared to the vast majority of other regular weapons.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game and why it has sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/">10 million copies</a> already by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>Death Stranding has reached a new milestone ahead of the sequel's release in a few months, Kojima Productions confirmed.</p>
<p>Today, it has been revealed that the first entry in the series connected over 20 million porters across all formats - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox, iOS, and Amazon Luna. This excellent result definitely bodes well for the sequel, which is launching in late June on PlayStation 5, and will presumably hit other formats in the future, like the original did after its PlayStation 4 release back in late 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">Death Stranding</a> is among the most unique open-world games ever released. As Sam Porter Bridges, players travel to a post-apocalyptic version of the United States called the United Cities of America, literally building connections between isolated communities to restore the bonds between the survivors of the apocalyptic Last Stranding. This unique experience was later enhanced in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">Director's Cut</a> release, which added more features, including enhanced combat features.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which will launch on <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">June 26th on PlayStation 5</a>, is looking to bring everything up to eleven with plenty of new mysterious characters, including Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli, who bears a striking resemblance to Solid Snake. Thankfully, it won't be long before we learn if the inclusion of this character will bridge the gap between the two series in some unexpected ways.</p>

			<p>The announcement of the long-rumored Final Fantasy IX may be imminent as Square Enix is gearing up to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Earlier today, a new <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary news page</a> went live on the series' portal website, revealing some of the projects that will mark the occasion, including new figurines, plushies, and a commemorative record featuring a newly recorded version of the Melodies of Life theme song called Timeless Tale. Interestingly enough, a couple of months back, a Reddit user called<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i2putn/comment/m7gztwq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TomAto314</a> revealed they knew of this record, and the information in their possession suggested that the music contained in it was for a game, so there's a good chance this new version of the theme song could have been recorded for the yet to be announced remake.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake is one of the very few projects by Square Enix revealed via a massive GeForce Now leak a few years back that has yet to be announced. According to rumors, the remake will be quite <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">faithful to the original</a>, so we shouldn't expect a massive overhaul in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. Unfortunately, it seems like we will have to wait a few more months to see Zidane and the gang back in action, as the remake isn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/">expected to release this year</a>, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a lot of different side activities that reward players not only with experience points but also with all sorts of items, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-get-resources/">resources</a> that can be used to improve the Hideout and Legendary equipment, and Knowledge points, which are used to unlock new parts of Naoe and Yasuke's skill trees.</p>
<p>Among the activities that Naoe alone can complete to earn Knowledge points, as well as unlock a specific achievement, are Kuji-Kiri, quick time events where Naoe meditates while sitting in some rather stunning locations. If you're having trouble finding all 22 Kuji-Kiri locations, you have definitely come to the right place, as the maps below, divided by region, will help you pinpoint the locations with ease without having to look behind every nook and cranny of the game's massive map.</p>
