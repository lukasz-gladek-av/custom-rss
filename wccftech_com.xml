			<p>Less than two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-rebuilds-ship-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voyagers update</a>, Hello Games is launching BREACH, a new free update for No Man's Sky. The British indie developer said Voyagers was a huge success, with the highest player numbers ever recorded in the game. </p>



<p>Naturally, they hope to continue this streak with BREACH, which introduces space wrecks for players to explore. This allows them to experience the thrill of spacewalking in No Man's Sky. Salvaging these wrecks will unlock a wide range of new ship-building parts, which fans have regularly requested for some time. Hello Games also improved and expanded the ship-building feature after seeing players spend so much time designing their dream ships in the game's workshop.</p>



<p>BREACH also adds a new Expedition where players traverse a desolate and abandoned universe and discover what happened to a mysterious wreck. To salvage from the wreckage of the ill-fated ship and add unique parts and modules to your ship-building workshop, they will have no choice but to voyage to the very edge of space.</p>



<p>Such space shipwrecks have begun to appear throughout the far reaches of space, and the bravest Travellers who are prepared to scavenge from them will be rewarded with new parts, including new vertical and structural ones, which will enable the creation of colossal ships, as well as rare, glowing, Atlas-themed wings, engines, and features.</p>



<p>The BREACH Expedition also brings No Man's Sky players together to explore strange, purple-star solar systems. The developers reckon the planets in these systems are particularly enjoyable to explore due to their deep oceans, incredible terrain, and volatile gas giants. The Expedition also features a spooky story, and it's the perfect time for it with Halloween coming up next week.</p>
