			<p>PS Plus subscribers will add <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-boltgun-old-school-fps-2023/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> to their libraries for May 2025.</p>
<p>PS Plus subscribers on every tier, including the base-level Essential tier, will be able to add these games to their libraries beginning <strong>May 6, 2025</strong>, a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-may-ark-survival-ascended-balatro-warhammer-40000-boltgun/">PlayStation Blog</a> announced. The final day to grab the games for April 2025, which are RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory, is <strong>May 5, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>It's a pretty strong month overall for PlayStation Plus subscribers, who can at least look forward to trying these games after the most recent PS Plus news. Sony recently confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">over 20 games would exit</a> the game catalogs for PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium subscribers, including first-party titles like the first two Resistance games. Neither of which are playable on PS5, except through the PS Plus Premium classic's game catalog.</p>
<p>Removing first-party titles from its own subscription service isn't anything new for PlayStation, but it did feel even more egregious since this happened after the latest price hike for the service in over 20 countries. The United States has been left out for now, but Canada, Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Colombia, Chile, and others are all already dealing with the higher prices.</p>
<p>Other notable games exiting soon are Grand Theft Auto V, Ghostrunner, and Infamous: Second Son, which is another first-party title, but at least it is still playable on PS5 and PS4 without having access to it through a PS Plus subscription.</p>
<p>The three games for May 2025 will be available to grab until June 2, and by then, we'll know which games PlayStation will use to try and keep players happy for June 2025.</p>

			<p>Sea of Stars was one of the indie darlings of the year when it launched in 2023, taking home the prize for best independent game at The Game Awards that year, and surpassing <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-stars-sales-250k/">250K copies sold</a> in its first week. Shortly after its win at The Game Awards, Quebec-based developer Sabotage Studio announced that more than<a href="https://wccftech.com/classic-turn-based-rpg-sea-of-stars-surpassed-4-million-players-across-all-platforms-and-subscription-services/"> 4 million players</a> had jumped into Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to love Sea of Stars, and there's soon going to be another one. The release date for its upcoming free DLC, Throes of the Watchmaker, has just been announced for <strong>May 20, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Players who own Sea of Stars across all platforms will be able to download the DLC once it launches in a few weeks' time (from time of writing) and enjoy an extra 8 hours of gameplay, with a side-adventure for the sibling solstice warriors Valere and Zale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throes of the Watchmaker takes the two heroes on a miniature adventure to the land of Horloge, which is currently overrun by an evil carnival. By the look of the trailer, Valere and Zale will also have to contend with evil versions of themselves in their quest to cut short the carnival's sadistic fun on the innocent people of Horloge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/12/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-devs-deep-dive-into-3-player-co-op-and-combat-2-0-live-today/">last major update</a> Sea of Stars received added three-player co-op, both locally and online, and made sweeping changes to combat that all seem to be present in Throes of the Watchmaker. The DLC will also introduce new classes for Valere and Zale, and a new playable character called Arty. Sabotage Studio also confirmed that this DLC will be playable in three-player co-op.</p>
