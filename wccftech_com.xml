            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-comes-with-a-below-average-display-and-disappointing-hdr-support-new-in-depth-analysis-reveals.1208082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with a below-average display that fails to deliver an acceptable HDR experience, according to a new in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>The new analysis by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamingTech-YouTube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamingTech</a>, which can be watched in full below, takes a good look at the new Nintendo system's display, confirming it comes with a maximum peak brightness of around 400, 450 nits. Measuring the brightness in Zelda: Breath of the Wild returned a maximum value of 420 nits, but in Cyberpunk 2077, it is locked to 450 nits, likely the maximum peak brightness the display is capable of. This peak brightness is not even close to providing a proper HDR experience, which is made worse because we are talking about an LCD display that fails to display black correctly due to the back lighting and the constant black level rise of 0.5 nits.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2's HDR support in docked mode fares a little better. The system-level calibration is found to be adequate, and in games like Cyberpunk 2077, the system delivers an HDR experience on par with that of the other versions of the game. In other games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the HDR experience is rather disappointing, as the game looks washed out due to its aesthetics and the lack of contrast.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches today worldwide. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/">day one update</a> has also been rolled out in all regions, enabling network features, access to the new eShop, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-new-system-update-fixes-vrr-issue/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest PlayStation 5 system software update, released yesterday, introduced a rather major fix alongside the minor enhancements documented in the official update note.</p>
<p>As initially reported on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1l3ane7/it_seems_like_todays_ps5_software_update_fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;PlayStation 5 subreddit</a>, and later confirmed by Sony itself to Digital Foundry, the latest system software update fixed a known VRR issue that caused stuttering in games running at 120 Hz with unlocked framerate like The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, Kingdom Come Deliverance II, and Diablo 4. The stuttering issues would present themselves even in games that do not have 120 Hz modes but take advantage of the system-level feature that works in the 48Hz to 60Hz range, and even in this case, the issues have been reportedly fixed, as Elden Ring no longer starts stuttering after 20 minutes of play like it did before. It's definitely surprising not to see this rather major PlayStation 5 issue getting fixed highlighted in the patch notes, but still, it's very good that Sony finally addressed this issue to offer on its current-generation systems the same smooth VRR experience that has been provided by the Xbox Series systems.</p>

<p lang="en">Sony PR contacted me yesterday to confirm that - as already detected by some - the latest PlayStation firmware resolves the VRR hiccup issue. When I find a spare moment, I'll test it out.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-04-11-40-00/">PlayStation 5 system software update</a> did not introduce any major new features to the console, introducing only improvements for messages and usability on some screens. The latest update, which introduced some new features, was released back in April. It reintroduced the PlayStation 30th Anniversary UI and the Audio Focus feature, which allows players to better hear quiet sounds and voice chat in games.</p>

			<p>One of the most interesting surprise announcements from <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play</a> is Sea of Remnants. Developed by Joker Studio, primarily known for the asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game Identity V, and published by NetEase Games, the game is described as a free-to-play ocean adventure roleplaying game scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>Sylar Pan, Product Lead at Joker Studio, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Sea of Remnants places the world’s fate directly in the players’ hands. With more than 300 characters to interact with—whether as allies, enemies, or something in between—every action can trigger surprising and far-reaching consequences. We’re excited to see the stories players will create when they finally set sail.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Remnants | Anchors Aweigh, Capt'n -  Gameplay Trailer | Get ready for PlayStation!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02YOz0N51ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The premise of Sea of Remnants is quite peculiar. Players will take the role of puppet-looking sailors who have lost all their memories and embark on a journey alongside a mysterious girl across vast seas and uncharted islands to a city slowly awakening to its secrets.</p>
<p>During their travels, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and assemble specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision, whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities, will have dramatic consequences for the world. As rival factions react to each choice and the cityscape of Orbtopia evolves in response, no two captains will experience the same journey.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while land combat is turn-based, naval fights take place in real time, with positioning and timing playing a crucial role in the outcome. As mentioned by the developer in the above statement, there will be over 300 non-player characters to interact with, each featuring distinct designs and personalities as well as their own allegiances. Players can befriend, provoke, or remove them. When in Orbtopia, players will even find leisure activities such as mahjong, and life skills such as hotspot cooking and fishing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> of Sea of Remnants already includes the minimum and recommended requirements.</p>
