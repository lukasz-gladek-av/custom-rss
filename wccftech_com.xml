			<p><strong>Circana</strong> executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> has shared his first monthly sales report of 2026 for video game sales in the US, and it's <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong> taking the top spot on the premium sales charts for January 2026. Overall spending in the video game industry in the US was up <strong>3%</strong> compared to last year, with subscription services and hardware sales driving that growth.</p>



<p>It's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's second month in a row sitting atop the US premium game sales charts, though finishing 2025 as the best-selling game of December was not enough to beat <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>, which was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game of 2025 in the US.</a> That said, the lack of content coming to Battlefield 6 (its second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-now-live-drives-highest-steam-concurrent-count-this-month/">only arrived earlier this week</a>) did not help its January 2026 sales, as the game fell out of the top three to <strong>fifth</strong> place on the sales charts.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <strong>NBA 2K26</strong> kept its second-place spot, <strong>Minecraft</strong> moved up to fourth place from eighth, and <strong>Madden NFL 26</strong> went from fourth to third. Overall, not a whole lot of shuffle in the top five, but in the top ten, there was one very notable entry that moved up from <strong>225th</strong> place all the way to <strong>ninth</strong> place. </p>



<p>That game was <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong>, which made its massive jump into the top ten thanks to its release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> last month.</a> Technically, even though <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> sits between FFVII and the only new release on the charts, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/">Code Vein 2</a></strong>, it's probable that Code Vein 2 missed the top ten because of FFVII Remake.</p>



<p>That said, at least when looking solely at PC game sales in the US, Code Vein 2 sat at the top of the charts.</p>







<p>The only other game included in the top 20 for January 2026 that wasn't already one of the top 30 best-selling games in the US for December 2025 was <strong>Fallout 4</strong>, which just eeks in at the number 20 spot after being in <strong>68th</strong> place in December 2025. </p>



<p>As we move deeper into the year, it'll be interesting to see how long Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 can hold a spot above Battlefield 6 in the charts, and which upcoming games are able to keep both of them out of first place.</p>



<p>Moving away from the sales charts, while January isn't known for being a major period in the year for players spending a lot on games, especially since it arrives just after the holiday craze, overall spending in the US video games industry was up <strong>3% </strong>compared to January 2025, driven by hardware and subscription spending. </p>







<p>A sign that people were probably using their monetary holiday gifts to grab a new console, specifically the <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which were the number one and two best-selling hardware units for January 2026. Looking at hardware spending alone, January 2026 was a <strong>16% increase</strong> compared to January 2025.</p>



<p>With the January 2026 report in the books, it'll be interesting to see where the charts line up for February 2026, especially since there are more than a few major releases from this month, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-sells-1m-copies-fastest-selling-game-series/">one-million unit seller <strong>Nioh 3</strong></a> and the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong>.</p>
