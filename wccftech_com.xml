			<p>CI Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted the first gameplay trailer of Lords of the Fallen II</a> at The Game Awards 2025, confirming the 2026 release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-debut-trailer-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned earlier this year</a>. </p>



<p>The trailer showcased some of the improvements confirmed for this sequel, including the introduction of a brand new dismemberment feature, which enables players to neutralize their opponents in a more decisive and expedient manner. This feature is complemented by the addition of novel executions, which further refine the combat experience. The press release also promised an even greater diversity of enemy types and boss battles of such remarkable intricacy that they will challenge even the most hardcore player, whether engaging in solo play, shared progression co-op, or optional PvP multiplayer.</p>



<p>However, there are also some philosophical changes in Lords of the Fallen II. CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski discussed those, as well as his more active role in the development of the sequel, <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2000284433052758033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Many of you asked why the game initially had body type A/B. Hexworks started early 2020 as an autonomous studio owned by CI Games. Early on, political correctness and filtering meant not every decision reached me on time. I got a lot more involved from late 2024 and now act as Head of Studio alongside my CEO role. Things are very different now and the studio got fully integrated. We reverted a lot of wrong decisions and will continue improving. Lords of the Fallen II is being built on real player feedback, and it’s crystal clear in the last two trailers.</em></p>



<p>Later in the X thread, a follower asked whether the game would feature attractive female characters and revealing armors, and the executive <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2000294076826997103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied affirmatively</a>. In another response, he confirmed that enemy placement, one of the most common complaints levied against the predecessor, would be improved in the new title.</p>

<p>Alongside the Lords of the Fallen II trailer, publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have also released a new update for Lords of the Fallen (2023). Enemies and bosses in particular received 'extensive behaviour updates' throughout the game, increasing the level of challenge. Several boss weapons also feature brand new signature attack animations. Lastly, Veteran Mode's bosses have been further empowered with faster transitions, highly aggressive behavior, and new attack patterns.</p>
