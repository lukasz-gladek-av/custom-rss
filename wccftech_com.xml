			<p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Studios have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">announced</a> a Galactic Emergency, as the Illuminate have begun their "<em>true</em>" invasion, with their goal being to hit Super Earth directly.</p>
<p>The new update adds new enemies for Super Earth's defenders to squash in the name of freedom, including Stingrays, which are described as "<em>jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky</em>," and the Crescent Overseer, which specializes in attacking Helldivers who are trying to regroup and take cover.</p>
<p>The third new enemy is the one we get the best look at in the trailer for the Galactic Emergency update, the Fleshmob, which looks like what you'd think something called 'Fleshmob' would look like. A big pile of organic matter with more arms than anyone should ever have stomping around in an unsightly manner.</p>

<p>To combat these new foes, Helldivers will have new methods of customizing their weapons, with primary weapons now featuring different attachments that can be unlocked by achieving new levels for each primary weapon. Once you've hit the required level for a weapon, you can unlock the attachment through Requisition, according to the PlayStation Blog post. Customizations range from being able to adjust ammo capacity, muzzles, and add under-barrel attachments. You'll also be able to unlock new cosmetic customizations for your weapons.</p>

<p>Arrowhead also announced that new patterns for previously released Warbonds will be released on May 15, 2025, alongside the launch of the latest Warbond, Masters of Ceremony.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 was one of the biggest games in 2024, and one of the year's biggest surprises, since no one was looking to its release as one of the marquee launches of the year, until it launched and absolutely exploded in popularity. It is easily the biggest success story regarding Sony's live service efforts, which is interesting to note given the context that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-praises-sony-for-their-creative-freedom-was-inspired-by-no-mans-skys-comeback/">as Arrowhead chief executive officer Shams Jorjani said earlier this year,</a> Sony and PlayStation have let Arrowhead steer the ship with Helldivers 2.</p>
