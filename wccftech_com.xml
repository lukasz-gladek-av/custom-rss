			<p>Today, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">announced it will soon require facial recognition-based age verification</a> from its players to unlock communication features. Beginning in the first week of December, starting with Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, and the rest of the world in 2026, this new security feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-experiences-iarc-age-ratings-age-verification-end-of-2025/">is the latest effort from the company to make it a safer platform for children</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>All users can now voluntarily go through the Facial Age Estimation process to secure their access to communication features," </em>it wrote in a new blog post<em>. "During the first week of December, we’ll begin enforcing the age check requirement in select markets including Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Those requirements will extend to the rest of the world wherever chat is available in early January.</em>"</p>



<p>With this decision, Roblox claims it is "<em>ushering in [a] new safety standard</em>," and says "<em>this innovation supports age-based chat and limits communication between minors and adults</em>."</p>



<p>Following the passing of new legislation in the UK, Discord implemented its own facial recognition age verification for its British users. Facial recognition that was immediately tricked <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">with nothing more than a copy of Death Stranding</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, Roblox's verification could fare much better, but while this new measure could do what the company claims it can do, it's by no means a perfect solution. </p>



<p>"<em>As the internet has matured, technological advancements in safety and security have steadily shifted the industry's approach to age assurance. While initial efforts relied on simple self-declared age to manage access to features, the industry has since progressed to behavioral based methods</em>," the blog continues.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, Roblox is going further. We’re unlocking chat and age-appropriate experiences for our users by requiring them to complete an age check through Facial Age Estimation or ID verification<sup>1</sup>. Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">Trusted Connections</a> with people they know.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>This initiative is designed to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for all users, which we believe will improve interactions for users of all ages on Roblox."</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/">Last week, on November 13, approximately fifteen minutes before</a> they were meant to be published, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the release of its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year. It also announced that it would stop trading ahead of the market's opening the next day, which was a step reportedly taken "<em></em><em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>." Now, it has been confirmed <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2ek0UOt9DZO072eswdJsmx/8585762d888e7a5f75001725aba1ab2b/PR_19_11_2025_EN.pdf">that those delayed results will be public by the market's opening on Friday, November 21, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing can stop people from speculating, necessarily or otherwise, and the big speculation surrounding the delay is the idea that Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">is going the way of EA and becoming a privately owned company</a>. Not owned by the same Consortium that is in the process of owning EA Sports FC, but by Chinese publisher and developer Tencent, with which Ubisoft recently opened a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>The same Vantage Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">that now houses the rights to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six</a>, the three franchises Ubisoft considers to be its most significant across its portfolio. It's worth noting that there's been no official word that Ubisoft is actively looking to be acquired. </p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">reports of the company's shareholders allegedly talking about a buyout</a>, but Ubisoft's only word on the question has been, "<em></em><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em>"</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that the delay could have been for something as small as a copy error in the results that needed fixing, instead of the latest major shift in the layout of the video game industry. Though if it happens, it'll continue the streak of extremely high-scale consolidation we've seen in recent years.</p>
