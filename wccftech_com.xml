			<p>Hollow Knight Silksong is finally out and available for anyone who wants it across all major console platforms and PC, and after years of working on it to get it ready for release, Team Cherry has officially moved to working on it post-release. Earlier today, the studio <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">debuted</a> the patch notes for Hollow Knight Silksong's first update, which mainly fix plenty of bugs and progression issues, but also include balancing fixes for players struggling in the early game.</p>



<p>The new update will be out "<em>mid next week</em>" according to Team Cherry, though if you're playing on PC you can access the update right now through the public beta branch on Steam and GOG.</p>



<p>Some of the bug fixes address a few early progression blockers, as well as late game issues that stop players from accessing elements of the game that should be available to them, but the significant additions for players just getting into Hollow Knight Silksong are the balance tweaks to the game's first two bosses.</p>



<p>"<em>Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter</em>," the patch notes read, along with a "<em>reduction in damage from Sandcarvers</em>," a "<em>slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices</em>," a "<em>slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders</em>," and an <em>"increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries</em>."</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong has already surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">5 million players</a> since it launched just five days ago at the time of this writing. It's easily one of the biggest indie games of 2025, and a game of the year contender in the eyes of many who've already checked it out.</p>



<p>If you are having a frustrating time with Silksong, but don't exactly want to directly tone down the difficulty, there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mods-enjoyable-challenge/">mods already available that add a level of fun to the game</a> without breaking its challenge. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom/">Gamescom</a> I had the chance to try out many different games. While many like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-promising-return/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/">Phantom Blade Zero</a> were a known quantity, there were a few other unexpected surprises, like One More Level's <a href="https://wccftech.com/valor-mortis-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-amazing-standout-and-one-of-the-shows-best/">Valor Mortis</a> and FLASK, a roguelike auto battler by Chop Chop Games to be published by Ghost Ship Games which felt every bit as good to play as it was to look at with its hand-draw style heavily reminiscent of the best comic books.</p>



<p>Already from its simple premise, FLASK shows incredible creativity with that little touch of wackiness that never goes amiss in certain types of games. Embarking on journey through a dangerous, dark medieval landscape, players take on the role of an alchemist heavily in debt who has to collect various flasks to power up an army of homunculus warriors to take on the goblin hordes and earn enough gold to pay off the debt. This journey is conducted via multiple hand-drawn maps featuring randomly generated nodes where players can access shops to purchase flasks, obtain flasks for free, interact with NPCs via which the main story is developed, and fight enemies using the current party of homunculi warriors. At the start of a run, only one homunculus will be available but as the adventure proceeds, players can add more homunculi to their party, up to a total of three, and even save different party configurations to deal with any unforeseen challenge.</p>

<p>Being able to handle any situation on the fly using what's available is the core of any roguelike experience, and from my short time with FLASK, it's evident how the game turns this up to eleven. The game is clearly aimed towards a hardcore roguelike audience, with very challenging auto battles upon which the player has no control, except for the flasks that the homonculi can equip for improved stats and special effects. These flask, which are exclusive to each homunculus type and activate in a set order during combat, have some widely different effects, some a little complicated to come to grasp with in a short amount of time, but the synergy opportunities they offered looked impressive, so much so that, at the end of my time with this early build of FLASK, I had to stop to check out what I had on hand and how I could set them up to win even the most challenging of fights. Better yet, these party setups can also be put to the test against those of other players via asynchronous PvP, which is sure to add another dimension to a game that is setting out to be an incredibly solid addition to the genre.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Loving roguelikes in the vein of FLASK where synergies between different powers are key, I would have spent hours testing out what the game had to offer in this sense, so I was more than a little disappointed when my Gamescom 2025 session ended, cutting my time with the game short. Hopefully, the game will deliver on the potential evident in this early build when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3714280/Flask">Steam</a> sometime next year.</p>
