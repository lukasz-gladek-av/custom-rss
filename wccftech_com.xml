			<p>A new update for Lords of the Fallen is launching today, thanks to creators CI Games and HEXWORKS. With this update comes a brand new tutorial, updates to the Umbral system, and some gameplay balancing to provide a smoother experience for those who are getting stuck into the game. In addition, Update 1.6 for Lords of the Fallen adds the PS5 Pro enhancement update, which provides a ton of graphical improvements for those who plan on picking up the game. One of the most critical parts of the update, other than the graphical improvements, is the enhanced onboarding and tutorial experience, which is provided to newcomers after they receive feedback from veteran players.</p>
<p>With the gameplay and performance enhancements for the PS5 Pro, it adds a 40% increase in pixel density, with an enhanced Performance Mode that means the game will run at 4K60 based on 1440p, and the Quality Mode will run at a native 4K30. The nitty-gritty of these enhancements was already covered prior and you can read all of that info on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate this major update, the standard version of Lords of the Fallen will be on a 50% discount on Steam from 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT through to November 11, costing $29.99. As stated above, the onboarding system is now a lot more gradual and kinder to allow players to get used to the ebb and flow of Lords of the Fallen. This includes the Umbral Lamp capabilities, as well as better navigation through the tutorial area, which previously was tripping players up and made it difficult to get to grips with the traversal system.</p>
<p>One of the most highly requested features for this update was to give players more time to thoroughly explore Umbral, the second realm that you could hop into and explore, which ran alongside the core world. There have been some changes to Umbral to make it a bit more accessible overall, which includes making the soundscapes subtler, as well as adjustments to the enemy spawn curve to improve the overall pacing of the secondary realm and a reduced vignette effect, which was previously quite significant and could smother some of the details of the Umbral Realm.</p>
<p>This update for Lords of the Fallen is available now on Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 and will be available for the PS5 Pro as of November 7, with the all-new graphical enhancements as listed in their announcement.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the patch notes' nitty-gritty and what else was changed besides these significant factors, they have uploaded the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1501750/announcements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full patch notes</a>, which tell you what you can expect from Lords of the Fallen now in update 1.6.</p>

			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.4 demo that is available for download for free shows how the engine can deliver some impressive realistic visuals.</p>
<p>The Rome demo by <a href="https://www.scansfactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scans Factory</a>, which can be downloaded by going&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q6AxF2kcqoWwoWztzQ3Jpg0bmL96R51J/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is an incredible ultra-realistic recreation of the capital of Italy, complete with rain effects that allowed the team to create some impressive reflections with puddles. Despite not being an exact recreation of the city, having been to Rome over a dozen times, I can say that the demo does an excellent job depicting the city's unique vibe, possibly even enhancing it by removing the crowds and the confusion that often populate its streets. In case you cannot run the demo, you can check it out in action in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="[8K21:9] Rome - most photorealistic game demo ever on Unreal Engine 5.4 - real ambient rain walk" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LKrJxLWubcE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the launch of the very first version of the engine back in 2022, Unreal Engine 5 has made some impressive strides that have improved it considerably. However, it has not addressed some of the biggest concerns, such as the stuttering issues that plague the vast majority of the games powered by Epic's latest engine, although version 5.4 did bring<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/"> significant CPU performance improvements.</a></p>
<p>While Unreal Engine 5.4 is the latest public version of the engine, version 5.5 is in the works and already available in preview. This version of the engine introduces MegaLights, which allows developers to have a massive number of movable dynamic lights with realistic area shadows and more. More information on this version of the engine can be found <a href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/unreal-engine-5-5-preview/2048423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

			<p>With only three days to go before the launch of the PS5 Pro console, Sony is understandably ramping up the marketing. Their most recent video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnyzLf7cddE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows</a> Insomniac Games (in particular, the team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-purpose-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>) talking about what's most exciting about the new hardware. The highlighted feature is, once again, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marcus Smith (Creative Director):</strong> As a developer, Insomniac Games is always trying to do the biggest and the best and bring the deepest experiences to players. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson (Animation Lead):</strong> Knowing that gamers have to choose between the two modes of Performance or Fidelity is a little frustrating because we want our players to have the best experience possible.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson (Principal Engine Programmer):</strong> What excites me the most about the PS5 Pro is that you're basically getting both Performance and Fidelity in one package. There's no fear of missing out on something by choosing one or the other; it's really a game-changer. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Marcus Smit</em></strong><em><strong>h:</strong> Our players no longer have to choose and that means they're seeing the true vision of the game that we're trying to create. They're able to have a much more emotional experience as they explore our graphically intense worlds and at an extremely high fluid frame rate. </em><em>It really has opened up our ability to create worlds much truer to the vision that we had originally. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson:</strong> PSSR is really exciting because it's this game-changer for bringing our visual fidelity up to the next level.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson:</strong> There's so much that we put into this game, so many details and exciting little surprises. The player should be able to have the best experience while getting to see all of those things. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson:</strong> Being able to deliver all that we have to offer from that game is going to be phenomenal. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson:</strong> I think we have endless possibilities, and this new experience is going to be the best player experience possible.</em></p>
<p>Insomniac Games was not the first developer to single out PSSR as the main PS5 Pro advancement. We recently heard the same from <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-key-feature-could-be-pssr-says-dying-light-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techland</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexon</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In other news, over the weekend, we got the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-specs-leak-unveils-2-extra-gb-of-ddr5-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full specs leak</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-teardown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first teardown video</a> ahead of the official launch scheduled for this Thursday.</p>
