			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-sounds-of-seattle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the final developer diary for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 before the end of 2024. The developer diary is dedicated to sound design in the upcoming first-person action roleplaying game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Unconventional Sound Sources" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FuPAJugr58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, by far the most interesting tidbit is that when the developer diaries resume next year, they will include 'customization, weapon systems, release date, and content expansion plans.' The latter is news to us, as there had been no previous hint at any expansion plans for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. It may be a sign that both the developer and publisher are confident in the game's quality and are, therefore, already planning to also create downloadable content to release post-launch.</p>
<p>Should that turn out to be the case, fans might be sighing in relief. Bloodlines 2 has had a troublesome development phase, to say the least. The game was being made by Hardsuit Labs <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the help of Bloodlines designer Brian Mitsoda</a>, but Paradox decided not to go forward with that version of the project. It came awfully close to being canceled, too, but The Chinese Room (Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes the Deep</a>) delivered a pitch that convinced Paradox to let them make Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>There have been changes, of course. While Seattle remains the setting, the main character has <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-dev-explains-why-they-switched-protagonist-to-an-elder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched</a> from being a newly converted Thinblood to a powerful Elder vampire called Phyre who has been forcefully laid dormant for a hundred years and suddenly awakens in an unfamiliar environment. At launch, players will be able to choose between the following clans: Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue. More will be added after the release, which is tentatively <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated</a> for the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>However, Paradox Interactive does not wish to repeat the painful experience of handling a project that is, in their own words, outside of their wheelhouse. As such, any further installments would be licensed out to a third-party studio.</p>

			<p>Warhorse Studios and developer Deep Silver have made the decision to move up the Kingdom Come: Deliverance II release date from February 11, 2025, to February 4, 2025. If that is the case, it means that they must be confident in how the game is currently shaping up and feel that it's already in a highly polished state. It has been confirmed that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has gone gold already, meaning that the main chunk of development has finished, and they are just working on bug fixes and tiny polishes. For those interested in the game, it's set to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PC via Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Apparently there is some more exciting news that is set to be released by Warhorse Studios and Deep Silver in the coming days, including a new story trailer, which will be premiering tomorrow. When the trailer goes live, the console and PC specifications will be released, which will include information about the PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, as well as how the Quality and Performance modes will affect the game on console.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance was an incredibly popular game, so it's no surprise that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a fantastic game with a lot of love poured into it. The team behind it has put a lot of effort into making it historically accurate, and Chris Wray previewed the game just three months ago, where he talks about his thoughts and feelings on playing the game, which you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/"> read here</a>.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, the team has been dropping details left and right about the game, including lengthy videos that showcase some of the gameplay that players can expect to experience for themselves when the game releases in February. This is a game that has been covered extensively on this site, from<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/"> Q&amp;As</a> to the preview to talking about how the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance has managed to sell eight million copies thus far.</p>
<p>Most recently, Warhorse Studios and Deep Silver released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shown-in-new-43-minute-long-gameplay-video/">43-minute gameplay video</a>, which was featured in December's IGN First. While the developers had the option to swap over to Unreal Engine, much like many developers in current-day game development, they decided to keep using Crytek's CryEngine, and the game is still shaping up to look stunning and immersive for those history buffs out there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/over-the-top-wwi-invites-players-to-100-v-100-multiplayer-playtest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Flying Squirrel Entertainment, the team behind Battle Cry of Freedom and <a href="http://wccftech.com/mount-targeting-800-characters-at-60fps/">Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</a>, has announced that the playtest for their highly-anticipated upcoming title, Over The Top: WWI, has started and will run through to 4 AM EST / 10 AM CET on December 9. This title is shaping up to be chaotic carnage, as players will get to participate in third-person 100 v 100 multiplayer, as well as single-player combat set in the muddy fields and trenches of the First World War. Players are given the option to play as either the Central Powers or the Triple Entente.</p>
<p>For those interested in participating in the playtest, it is completely free to join, and those interested can join via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778610/Over_The_Top_WWI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game's Steam Page</a>. If you aren't sure whether this is something you want to play, Flying Squirrel Entertainment has released a trailer that shows off some of what you can expect from the playtest. It's just over a minute and a half long and shows off some of the chaos you can expect to get into.</p>
<p>"This latest will offer a host of features and updates, including destructible environments, the ability to call in airstrikes, and more. We are now entering the final stages of development as we build the game alongside our community and march towards release," says the team at Flying Squirrel Entertainment.</p>
<p><iframe title="Over The Top: WWI - December Playtest live now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGpzPFUjtS4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don't want to play with other people, you can play in a single-player mode in the Over The Top: WWI playtest and utilize bots instead in an entirely destructible and realistic environment based on the First World War. The single-player mode is easy to navigate, as it has an "instant battle" mode, with confrontations taking place in front of you with up to 200 bots. There are plenty of weapons to try out and experiment with, including Bolt-Action Rifles, Revolvers, Axes, Grenades, and Flamethrowers. There are over 50 unique weapons to choose from, with six different types of armored vehicles and ten different Artillery pieces to experiment with.</p>
<p>As stated above, the environments are completely destructible, adding to the mayhem and chaos of the game. You are able to destroy bridges, fell trees, enemy fortifications, and even punch holes in walls to test out your strength.&nbsp; Along with the destructible environments, there is dynamic terrain. This means that any artillery shells, hand grenades, and rifle grenades used will create realistic craters in the ground. Additionally, you can use shovels and pickaxes to manipulate the ground to your benefit and create trenches to help you defend against the enemy in Over The Top: WWI.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaijin%E2%80%99s-game-showcase-shows-off-dagor-engine%E2%80%99s-power.1051854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gaijins-game-showcase-shows-off-dagor-engines-power/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new video released by Gaijin Entertainment, people can compare the studio's Dagor Engine, which has been free and open source since last year, with the industry-leading Unreal Engine 5 from Epic Games. The video shows off content from the East District, a part of Gaijin's unannounced game, with the content in the demo being made using both Dagor Engine and Unreal Engine 5. In addition to the video, Gaijin Entertainment has also released the full code of one of Dagor Engine's multiplayer frameworks under a permissive license, along with the art sources of one of the multiplayer samples. Those interested can look at the East District demo on both Dagor Engine and Unreal Engine, depending on your preference.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dagor Engine — East District" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/miABl6aekBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gaijin Entertainment decided to do this to showcase the engine by asking their partners over at Hooks Creative Studio to create an FPS map that was inspired by iconic maps of the past. This map was built by the team at Hooks Creative Studio totally from scratch, using Megascan and modern Photogrammetry assets on Unreal Engine 5. Once this was done, they then continued by moving the map over to Dagor Engine, which is now being used in their unannounced game. Gaijin Entertainment has said that it's beneficial to have it in both Unreal Engine and Dagor Engine, as they can use it for comparison and use it as an internal validation of the existing Dagor technology.</p>
<p>Gaijin found that the Dagor map runs faster while providing an equal or superior (subjectively, they admitted) visual fidelity. The map uses state-of-the-art technologies, such as real-time global illumination and advanced anti-aliasing. While it doesn't use vendor-specific performance-enhancing techniques such as DLSS, XeSS, or FSR, Dagor does support all of them. <a href="https://gaijinent.com/news/demos-of-a-new-gaijins-game-showcase-dagor-engine-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaijin has said that the Dagor demo</a> operates in native resolution in most configurations, while the Unreal Engine version does not, which helps demonstrate the performance of the Dagor Engine.</p>
<p>The company admits that they can't compare them fully, as the Unreal Engine version of the demo has the potential to be further optimized by experienced developers. However, by releasing both versions of the demos, they hope to encourage developers to explore using Dagor Engine in more of their projects. This engine powers titles such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaijin-ceo-interview-we-wouldnt-have-launched-war-thunder-on-steams-current-state/">War Thunder</a> and Enlisted.</p>
