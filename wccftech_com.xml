			<p>This morning, <strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku</strong> <strong>Studio</strong> and <strong>SEGA</strong> have announced that a free <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</strong> demo will be released later today on all platforms, albeit at different times. The PC version will get it first, at <strong>7 AM Pacific Time</strong>, while the console versions for Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for download at <strong>9 PM Pacific Time</strong>.</p>



<p>Unlike other recent demos, users <strong>won't be able to carry over their save data to the full game</strong>, so it's really just a way to try the game before purchase. RGG Studio and SEGA have also outlined which sections have been prepared for the demo:</p>



<ul>
<li>In Yakuza Kiwami 3, players can explore <strong>Ryukyu</strong> in <strong>Okinawa</strong> as <strong>Kazuma Kiryu</strong>, beating down bad guys and dynamically switching between the brutal Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami style and the weapon-based Ryukyu style. Players can also indulge in immersive side experiences such as karaoke, sub-stories, and outfit customisation.</li>



<li>In Dark Ties, players can enjoy <strong>an all-new story featuring Yoshitaka Mine</strong> and explore <strong>Kamurocho</strong>, experiencing a variety of activities while also mastering Mine's shoot-boxing combat to stylishly dispose of foes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-0-directors-cut-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced at the <strong>RGG Summit 2025</strong></a> in September. According to the developers, this is <strong>an 'extreme' remake</strong> of the third mainline installment in the series, which originally launched in 2009 for PlayStation 3 and later appeared on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>



<p>Additionally, there's new content in the form of Dark Ties, which is centered on Yoshitaka Mine. Narratively, <strong>it is a prequel</strong> in which Mine willingly plunges into the dark world of the Yakuza after losing everything. Driven by the pursuit to find true bonds, he embarks on a dramatic journey coloured by exhilarating boxing-based combat and a variety of side experiences.</p>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties will be released <strong>on February 12, 2026</strong> for all the aforementioned platforms. Pre-orders are already available, too, and pre-order customers will receive the bonus item Legendary Lad: Ichiban Kasuga that adds the fan-favorite character <strong>Ichiban Kasuga</strong> (protagonist of the more recent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon</a></strong> games) to the Ryukyu Gal Gang.</p>



<p>As part of the demo news, the Steam store page was also updated with the <strong>official PC system requirements</strong>, which we've added below.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in December 2021, following the success of <strong>Tainted Grail: Conquest</strong>, a deck-building/roguelike/RPG hybrid. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wasn't so fond of his experience with The Fall of Avalon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tainted-grail-something-wyrd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as you can read in the review</a>, but the user reception on Steam is great, with a review rating of 86% for recent reviews and 88% for overall reviews.</p>



<p>Given the successful launch, it is likely that Questline and Awaken Realms will work on a bigger, more polished sequel, though it may be a long time before it materializes. We'll keep you apprised of any news from the developer and publisher.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>1047 Games</strong> is making one, potentially final, bid to keep <strong>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</strong> alive with a new battle royale mode called <strong>Arena Royale</strong>. If you weren't aware, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is the new title for <strong>Splitgate 2</strong>, a name that emerged after <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">the maligned sequel was relaunched, and 1047 Games decided to shut down the OG Splitgate servers.</a> Arena Reloaded is meant to represent a combination of the best of both games, just like how its new Arena Royale mode is intended to be the best parts of a battle royale and an arena shooter in one.</p>



<p>That's the pitch made by 1047 Games design director <strong>Josh Watson</strong>, who breaks down what the team didn't like about current battle royales and how it let those feelings lead the design of Arena Royale to make a game mode that is still technically a battle royale mode, but in the most arena shooter way possible.</p>



<p>"<em>When we sat down to design Arena Royale, we knew we wanted to push it closer to that arena feel</em>," Watson begins. "<em>And we kept coming back to this core idea: <strong>less looting, more shooting</strong>. You see,</em> <em>traditional battle royales have long stretches where you're not really playing. You're staring at chests, traversing</em> <em>empty space, and waiting for your next fight."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Arena shooters are the opposite. They're about fast action and fast engagement. Arena Royale is the best of both worlds</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Arena Royale | SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvueCO7-ofo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Watson goes on to explain some of the core differences between the kind of battle royale you're already familiar with and the kind that 1047 Games has put together. You won't drop from a ship; you'll instead be dropped into a lobby ahead of every match, where you'll vote between one of the four available maps by standing in front of the one you want. </p>



<p>When the match begins, you'll instantly spawn in and go from there. The four available maps (or biomes, as Watson calls them) are <strong>Dought, Glacier, Fracture</strong>, and <strong>Outskirts</strong>, which is an entirely new biome that, frankly, at a quick glance, looks like a smaller knock-off of Kings Canyon from <strong>Apex Legends</strong>. That's not necessarily a bad thing; Kings Canyon is a pretty iconic map with some great POIs. If you're going to pull inspiration from anywhere, might as well pull it from what you know people already like.</p>



<p>Moving forward, other ways in which Arena Royale mixes an arena shooter and a battle royale is by doing away with any battle royale tropes that get in the way of fights. This manifests with chests opening instantly, a player's loot dropping in a big pile instantly when they die (no going through deathboxes), and most importantly, in its low player count, with only <strong>24 players to a match</strong>, in <strong>six teams of four</strong>.</p>



<p>You also won't find buy stations in any of Arena Royale's biomes, as you're able to upgrade equipment on the fly with money earned by doing damage, racking up kills, and completing events like Split Ball, Firecracker, and Hot Zone.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">Since Splitgate 2 relaunched</a>, unfortunately for the team at 1047 Games, it doesn't seem to have taken off. The relaunch came and went without anyone really noticing. The last time we heard from the team ahead of this update was to try and grab some attention and press <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">by responding to claims that the game was dead/dying due to its poor concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Making a big hullabaloo about its lacking Steam numbers did not, it may shock you to learn, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/">give it a boost in player numbers on Steam</a>. While Steam concurrent numbers are never the full picture, they're an indicator that, at least on one platform, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded has been unable to gain any serious traction. If that doesn't change, and if things aren't much better on Xbox or PlayStation, then the next time we see a major statement from the studio could very likely be about the studio and the game shutting down.</p>



<p>The Arena Royale mode and the rest of update 2.2 will arrive this Thursday, on <strong>January 22, 2026.</strong></p>
