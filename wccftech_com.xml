			<p>According to two separate and trustworthy sources, <strong>Microsoft</strong> is reportedly considering the merging of the <strong>Xbox Game Pass Premium</strong> console subscription tier with <strong>PC Game Pass</strong>. The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> that the plans are far from finalized, but that's what Microsoft is thinking right now, and Windows Central has subsequently <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-plans-to-expand-xbox-game-pass-and-merge-pc-game-pass-with-another-tier-more-third-party-service-bundles-may-be-on-the-way-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backed up the reporting</a> with its own sources.</p>



<p>Here's a breakdown of the respective feature sets as they are currently available to users:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Feature</th><th data-align="left">PC Game Pass</th><th data-align="left">Xbox Game Pass Premium</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Price</strong></td><td data-align="left">$11.99/month</td><td data-align="left">$14.99/month</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Platforms</strong></td><td data-align="left">PC only</td><td data-align="left">Console, PC, Cloud</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>First-Party Day-One Access</strong></td><td data-align="left">Yes</td><td data-align="left">No (added within 1 year)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>EA Play Included</strong></td><td data-align="left">Yes</td><td data-align="left">No</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Cloud Gaming</strong></td><td data-align="left">No</td><td data-align="left">Yes (unlimited)​</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong></td><td data-align="left">N/A (PC only)</td><td data-align="left">Yes (on console)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Game Library Size</strong></td><td data-align="left">Full PC catalog</td><td data-align="left">~200 games</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Merging Xbox Game Pass Premium with PC Game Pass likely means the new tier would include <strong>cloud gaming, EA Play, and first-party day-one access</strong>, arguably the three primary features of Game Pass. Of course, <strong>it's most likely going to cost slightly more</strong> if this plan goes through. It's hard to take a guess, but perhaps somewhere around $17-18.</p>



<p>At that point, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <strong>could really need more bundled third-party services to boost its value</strong>. Indeed, that's the other half of Warren's rumor, though he does not share any specifics on which ones. <strong>Ubisoft+ Classics</strong> and <strong>Fortnite Crew</strong> are already included <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since October's big restructuring</a>, so it would have to be something else. Do you reckon Microsoft should go forward with this merger plan, or would you rather things stay as they are? Let us know in the comments below.</p>



<p>In related Xbox news, it seems like the next-generation console <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2027</a></strong>, but Microsoft hasn't fully committed to that yet. Most sources agree <strong>it's going to be a console/PC hybrid</strong> that runs PC apps and will even have different SKUs from other OEMs like ASUS.</p>

			<p>Later this week, <strong>Sony</strong> is set to host its first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a> </strong>event of 2026. This hour-long showcase will include several announcements we could guess at, and many we won't be able to, but a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has pretty much cemented one of the announcements that we'll see at Thursday's show (if we don't see it tomorrow): the games entering the <strong>PS Plus Extra Catalog</strong> for February 2026. Which, according to the report, will be headlined by <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</strong></p>



<p>The first of <strong>Insomniac's</strong> Spider-Man titles, <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> (the remastered variant, that is), entered the PS Plus Extra library of games <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-august-2025-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-remastered/">back in <strong>August 2025</strong></a>. With <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong> already included in the catalog, this means that players who sign up for the second tier of <strong>PlayStation's</strong> subscription service will be able to play all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games so far.</p>



<p>Spider-Man 2 isn't the only game mentioned in the Dealabs report, as it also cites that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/neva-the-gris-follow-up-from-nomada-studio-receives-beautiful-new-gameplay-trailer/">Neva</a>,</strong> the follow-up to the critically acclaimed <strong>Gris</strong> from <strong>Nomada Studio</strong>, will enter the catalog alongside Spider-Man 2, as will <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a></strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 EXCLUSIVE 🚨</p><p>A big PS5 Console Exclusive is Coming to PS Plus Extra (Game Catalog)</p><p>Yes, it will be<br>🕷️ Marvel's Spider-Man 2</p><p>We reveal 2 other headliners in our latest report<br>(Other titles may be revealed tomorrow or during next State of Play)<a href="https://t.co/BqKAr24wqR">https://t.co/BqKAr24wqR</a></p></div>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/2021255882273620133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There will undoubtedly be more games than just those three entering the catalog, but those are the only ones mentioned in the report. Normally, it's worth taking any leaks you see ahead of showcases like Thursday's upcoming State of Play with a grain of salt, but in this case, you'll want to add more salt to the pile. Dealabs and Billbil-kun have an extremely strong record of revealing PS Plus news ahead of time.</p>



<p>So, at least in this case, we can bet that we'll see Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Neva, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown as part of the PS Plus Extra games for February 2026.</p>



<p>PS Plus subscribers at every tier can already enjoy <strong>Undisputed, Ultros, Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> and <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong> as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-february-2026-games-undisputed-ace-combat-subnautica-ultros/">PS Plus Essential games</a> for February 2026 (which, unsurprisingly, were leaked ahead of time by Dealabs).</p>
