			<p>Embark Studios announced during the Summer Game Fest 2025 showcase that its new PvPvE third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-shows-off-new-trailer-ahead-of-arc-raiders-playtest-this-week/">ARC Raiders</a> will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The fact that Embark Studios previous release, The Finals, was shadow-dropped during one of Geoff Keighley's other big annual showcases had players hoping that Arc Raiders would also be shadow-dropped today. Unfortunately for those hopefuls, that was not the case, and we'll still have to wait a few more months to jump into Arc Raiders.</p>
<p>Unless of course, you were able to get into the tech test last month, which went incredibly well, according to Embark. "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The tech test was the best rehearsal we could get, ahead of what's shaping up as a big release this fall. It’s clear that players recognize the passion, effort, and craftsmanship that’s been poured into the making of&nbsp;</span>ARC Raiders,</em>" said executive producer on Arc Raiders, <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Aleksander Grøndal, in a press release.</span></p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">The test also honed in on concrete things we’re addressing in this last stretch of</span></em> <em>development</em>," he continued.</p>
<p><em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"There are bugs to squash, as well as general polish and performance improvements to be done. We're also fine-tuning game balance and the player economy, and will work on an even better onboarding experience for players who come in new to this genre. At release, the game will be further expanded, with more locations to explore, more adventures to embark on, and more for players to strive towards and discover.</span></em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got the chance to join the tech test for ARC Raiders</a>, and though it's nearly impossible to determine the fate of any new multiplayer game nowadays, even from a team like Embark that has already broken through with a new game in The Finals, he found that ARC Raiders is at least promising.</p>
<p>"<em>So far, ARC Raiders shows promise. It's too early to tell whether it'll be the next big extraction shooter or just a passing trend, but Embark seems to have mixed in enough familiar and new elements to create an exciting recipe.</em>"</p>

			<p>Today at Summer Game Fest 2025, Playside Studios unveiled Game of Thrones: War for Westeros. This is a premium PC real time strategy game set in George R.R. Martin's beloved fantasy setting, and it's something that fans have been waiting a long time for.</p>
<p>Ryan McMahon, Game Director at PlaySide Studios, stated:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros takes fans back to the Seven Kingdoms. This time, you’re not watching the ‘Game of Thrones’ - you’re playing it. War for Westeros puts you in the seat of power, whether you’re leading the Starks, Targaryens, or Lannisters, or even commanding the Night King and his army of the dead, you’ll wield real power and rewrite the fate of the realm.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Game of Thrones: War for Westeros | Cinematic Reveal Trailer (Summer Game Fest)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uI9MDe0evFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Game of Thrones: War for Westeros, players lead the armies of House Stark, House Lannister, House Targaryen, or even the dreadful Night King. They'll engage in epic real-time strategy battles where forming strategic alliances and deceiving rival forces will be key. Each faction offers deeply asymmetric strategies, signature heroes, armies, and mechanics forged from the brutal legacy of Westeros. Players can deploy infantry, cavalry, siege engines, giants, and dragons to break enemy lines, working to outplay and outmaneuver rivals with the help of inspiring hero abilities and the ruthless instincts of a true war commander.</p>
<p>From the Wall to King's Landing, players can jump into skirmish matches or embark on a longer war across the Seven Kingdoms, either alone or with others. Every decision matters, and every battle carries forward. Whether playing alone or with friends, Game of Thrones: War for Westeros aims to give fans the chance to reimagine the most iconic battles and turning points from the series, manipulating the realm's politics to rally powerful bannermen, sway loyalties, and outmanoeuver enemies in a shifting struggle for power.</p>
<p>The game will be released in 2026. Meanwhile, wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2838950/Game_of_Thrones_War_For_Westeros/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-cube-is-an-mmorpg-shooter-set-in-the-atomic-heart-universe/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2025, Atomic Heart developer Mundfish also unveiled a new project called The CUBE. It still takes place in the same setting as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original game</a> and the freshly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ii-announced-coming-to-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>, but it will be a much different game: an MMORPG shooter.</p>
<p>The developers are trying to mix unique worldbuilding, an intriguing narrative, and exciting quests into one game. The goal is to create a living world full of memorable characters, diverse biomes, and tons of enemies, including powerful bosses. The backstory is that a giant cube appeared in the sky and players will have to scour its ever-shifting environments and mysteries.</p>
<p>Robert Bagratuni, Founder and CEO of Mundfish, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>At Mundfish, we were the first in the industry to implement a technology that allows thousands of objects to move and rotate simultaneously across massive stretches of terrain — online and in real time. No other game has ever done this before. This became possible thanks to our innovative proprietary split-rendering system, which redefines how motion is handled in interactive environments. The technology delivers maximum performance even under extreme load. In The CUBE, physics, ballistics, and gravity feel completely natural — but under the hood, it’s powered by rocket science. The system enables seamless transitions, precise object tracking, and synchronized multiplayer in a living, ever-evolving world. It’s a true technological breakthrough.</em></p>

<p>The CUBE has no release date yet, but given the genre, it might take a while. Meanwhile, you can already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3230430/The_CUBE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add it</a> to your Steam wishlist. The game is also being developed for consoles, by the way.</p>
