<h2>WWE 2K24 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/">8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>WWE 2K24 is a great game to get stuck into if you're looking to participate in some competition against friends and family. Alternatively, there's the career mode, where you work your way up the rankings and become an iconic wrestler of WWE. Compared to previous years, they've made some major improvements and made the game more immersive, allowing for a more realistic experience compared to some of the previous WWE games. Below is an excerpt from Nathan Birch's review.</p>
<p><em>With the release of WWE 2K24, this series no longer feels like a carny outcast amongst the other big sports franchises. While the game’s core action could stand to be even further refined, fun new mechanics, match types, and a fully-developed suite of modes, including significantly improved Showcase and MyGM offerings, are worth cheering for. While maybe not quite the total package just yet, WWE 2K24 feels like it’s ready for the bright lights.</em></p>

<h2>EA Sports FC 25</h2>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 was one of the most popular sports games to be released this year, according to information from both Circana and Newzoo. Ultimately, it's not too surprising. EA Sports FC is the replacement for the FIFA games and remains just as popular even without the official FIFA license. For a significant amount of time this year, it was one of the top games in the charts. It's the perfect game to be a sweaty gamer in. There were some <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major improvements to the game</a>, such as the introduction of the 5v5 <a href="https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rush mode</a> as well as the addition of being able to play using the women's teams the same way you would utilize the men's teams.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>F1 24</h2>
<p>Released in May, this is the perfect game for any petrolheads or fans of racing games. Compared to previous games in the franchise, F1 24 is very beginner-friendly and more accessible compared to previous iterations. There is plenty of variety, with 20 drivers and 10 teams to explore, not to mention the ability to <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-career-mode-finally-lets-you-play-as-a-current-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play in the career mode</a> as one of the current superstars. The handling model <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-features-dynamic-handling-the-series-most-comprehensive-physics-update-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a physics update</a>, too. Whether you decide to play and compete online against others or you play solely by yourself against AI in the Driver Career mode, there is a lot of replayability and promise from F1 24.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>EA Sports College Football 25</h2>
<p>One of the other major successful sports games of the year is EA Sports College Football 25. This game took off and was one of the best-sellers on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series. Fans who liked the College Football franchise had to wait a whopping 11 years between NCAA Football 14 and EA Sports College Football 25. While the actual football games were a massive part of the game, there were a lot of other features that made it enjoyable, including scheduling visits to colleges, getting to know the recruits, and playing with teams that are less significant than NFL teams.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>MotoGP 24</h2>
<p>Compared to previous iterations in the MotoGP franchise, this game didn't get a lot of new content or updates that made the game stand out from the crowd. That being said, it's a stunning game and offers the exhilarating experience that fans of this racing franchise are familiar with. While there wasn't much added in particular regarding racing, there were some pretty groundbreaking changes. This includes new transfer markets and being able to adapt the difficulty to your liking.</p>
