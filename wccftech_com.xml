			<p>Today, Eclipse Glow Games has shared an extended gameplay video of its exciting newly announced action/adventure game Tides of Annihilation. The video, published on IGN's YouTube channel, is embedded below. In the footage, we get to see a bit of exploration, some standard fighting, and a boss fight against the game's version of Mordred Pendragon.</p>
<p>It's clearly a work-in-progress build, but it shows a lot of promise, confirming what we already saw at Gamescom 2024 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in this article</a>.</p>
<p>In the game, players will explore an alternate version of London that lies in ruins, following a surprise invasion from another realm. They'll step into this world as Gwendolyn, supposedly the city's last surviving inhabitant, as she navigates otherworldly foes and gains awesome powers of her own.</p>
<p>Throughout Tides of Annihilation, Gwendolyn will be able to summon over ten legendary knights (picking two at a time). They were inspired by Arthurian myths, bringing unique skills and abilities that will allow players to craft their own fighting playstyles and combos. Such powers will be needed to face the gigantic knights that now roam ruined London. Players will get not only to fight them but also scale them, as they are practically levels of their own.</p>
<p>In this game, London isn't just devastated, it's also transformed. But there's also the fantasy realm of Avalon, where the supernatural is even more prevalent between ancient magic and legendary creatures. Throughout the journey, Gwendolyn will have to save her family, the city, and even reality itself.</p>

<p>The game is in development for PC and consoles with Unreal Engine 5, and the studio has already confirmed PS5 Pro support with ray tracing and 60FPS mode.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Tides of Annihilation, such as its planned length, the current boss target, and the tentative launch window, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our interview with Eclipse Glow Games from Gamescom 2024</a>.</p>

			<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot has dominated DICE Awards 2025 with five award wins:&nbsp;Outstanding Achievement in Animation, Outstanding Technical Achievement, Family Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, as well as the most coveted one, Game Of The Year.</p>
<p>It's another big victory for the platform game, which had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received the Game of the Year prize at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards</a> ceremony in December and <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-sweeps-at-new-york-game-awards-ceremony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the New York Game Awards</a> last month. So far, when taking in most outlets and organizations, Astro Bot has put itself far ahead of any other game released in 2024 when it comes to GOTY awards. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-24-best-games-of-2024-and-most-anticipated-of-2025-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here on Wccftech</a>, though, it only won the genre-specific award, whereas the overall Game of the Year went elsewhere.</p>
<p>On another note, the developers have just started releasing free new Astro Bot content. The Tick-Tock Shock level is already out, while four more levels will be rolled out according to the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feb 20: Thrust or Bust</li>
<li>Feb 27: Cock-A-Doodle-Doom</li>
<li>Mar 6: Hard to Bear</li>
<li>Mar 13: Armored Hardcore</li>
</ul>
<p>Team Asobi also confirmed that a PS5 Pro update for Astro Bot is on the way, allowing players to enjoy the game at 4K@60 frames per second.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the DICE Awards 2025 winners, Helldivers 2 won four prizes: Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition, Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design, Action Game of the Year, and Online Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which our staff voted as Wccftech's Game of the Year, won in the Outstanding Achievement in Character, Outstanding Achievement in Story, and Adventure Game of the Year categories.</p>
<p>Balatro developer LocalThunk also won three awards: Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game, and Mobile Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong prevailed in the Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction category, while Metaphor: Refantazio won RPG of the Year.</p>
<p>For the individual award, Don Jones received the Lifetime Achievement Award, while former Insomniac founder and CEO Ted Price (who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resistance-4-was-unsuccessfully-pitched-to-sony-a-while-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the cancellation of a Resistance 4 project) was officially inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>
