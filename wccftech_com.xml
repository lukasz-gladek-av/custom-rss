			<p>Xbox has announced the first batch of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the month of November 2025, with the big ticket of the month being Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is only available to PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, but will still undoubtedly make the biggest splash.</p>



<p>Surrounding Call of Duty is a slew of indie games, almost like Xbox didn't want to go out and grab anything too major for November for fear of overshadowing its golden goose. That's just some joking speculation, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/">it would be difficult for any game, no matter how big, to overshadow a Call of Duty release</a>.</p>



<p>That said, the games you'll be able to check out on Xbox Game Pass include Pigeon Simulator, a game where you play as a pigeon that is a member of a top-secret unit that has orders to deal with dangerous anomalies harming New Squawk City. Winter Burrow is a woodland survival game where you play as a mouse coming back home for the winter. Dead Static Drive is an indie survival horror game with Eldritch themes while carrying a spooky tone underneath it all.</p>



<p>All of those games, along with Black Ops 7, are available on their launch days, and as day one releases are only available to those at the Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>For those not at the top tier, you'll be able to add Sniper Elite: Resistance, Voidtrain, Great God Grove, and Lara Craft and the Temple of Osiris to your gaming time this month.</p>



<p>Here's a full list of what's coming to Xbox Game Pass in November 2025, and which tiers they'll all be available for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dead Static Drive - November 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Sniper Elite: Resistance - November 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Egging On - November 6 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Whiskerwood - November 6 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Voidtrain - November 7 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Great God Grove - November 11 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris - November 11 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Pigeon Simulator - November 11 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Relic Hunters Legend - November 12 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Winter Burrow - November 12 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - November 14 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, with games entering the subscription service, there are games leaving. This month, five games will leave the service, a couple of them being major departures. The departures are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Football Manager 2024 (both the PC and console versions)</li>



<li>Blacksmith Master</li>



<li>Frsotpunk</li>



<li>STALKER 2: Heart of Chernobyl</li>



<li>Spirittea</li>
</ul>

			<p>In Ninja Gaiden 4, Yakumo can use, at the end of the campaign, five different weapons all coming with unique properties and attacks, which are further expanded by their Bloodraven forms.While all of these weapons have their own unique uses, and are fully viable to complete the game at any difficulty, using some of them is going to make your life much easier. Here are the best of them.</p>

<h2 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Dark Dragon Blade is the best weapon in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-dark-dragon-blade">Dark Dragon Blade</h3>



<p>The Dark Dragon Blade is undoubtedly the <strong>overall best weapon</strong> Yakumo can use. Its damage output is only slightly lower than Ryu's Dragon Blade, but it combines that power with exceptional <strong>ease of use</strong> and high utility.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Damage &amp; Speed:</strong> Features very high base damage and one of the fastest light attacks in its Bloodraven/Shadow-gleam form.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Utility &amp; Crowd Control:</strong> Offers great utility with its circle motion input skills. Has an unblockable launcher to easily set up <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Izuna Drops</strong> and a powerful area-of-effect (AOE) ranged attack (B/Circle) in Shadow-gleam mode.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Defense:</strong> The fast Shadow-gleam form light attack can reliably stop most Power Attacks, making it excellent for boss battles as well.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> The only true downside is the time required to unlock it, as you<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/ninja-gaiden-ultimate-guide-dark-dragon-blade-unlock/"> must complete the game once and clear all of the Boss Trials challenges</a>. This effort, however, is well worth it.</p>



<h3 id="h-kage-hiruko">Kage-Hiruko</h3>



<p>Being the only ranged weapon in the game, the Kage-Hiruko grants great long-range combat capabilities that are extremely effective in the hands of expert players.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ranged &amp; Launchers:</strong> Excellent for long-range engagements and features a wealth of launcher attacks, including a quick light-heavy attack (X/Square - Y/Triangle) laucher string.</li>



<li><strong>Unique</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Flying Swallow:</strong> Has a unique version of the ever-useful Flying Swallow technique that also functions as a launcher.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Excellent Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The Nocturnal Rain AOE attack (A/Cross - X/Square) is massively useful, launching multiple enemies in a wide radius. The fast Bloodraven form light attack is perfect for stopping Power Attacks and break guards at all ranges.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">:</strong> The Kage-Hiruko loses out to the Dark Dragon Blade due to lower damage and moveset complexity.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Takeminakata twin blades are balanced weapons that hold their own at any difficulty level</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-takeminakata"><strong>Takeminakata</strong></h3>



<p>The twin blades are Yakumo's starting weapon, but they should absolutely not be dismissed. While their damage output is only acceptable, the weapon's strength lies in its <strong>incredible versatility and utility</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Provides quick access to multiple launchers and a handy area-of-effect (AOE) attack (circle motion - Y/Triangle).</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Offers amazing crowd control in Bloodraven Form. This includes the two heavy aerial attacks, which are easier to charge than ground attacks, and the Rising Stance: Spin technique (A/Cross - X/Square), which can decimate multiple enemies in a single strike while in Berserk State.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides</strong>: While utility trumps damage, the Takeminakata's lower damage makes it a less reliable choice at high difficulty levels, where fights must be ended quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-magatsuhi">Magatsuhi</h3>



<p>Heavily reminiscent of the glorious Lunar Staff in Ninja Gaiden 2, the Magatsuhi staff is a solid weapon that deals <strong>good damage</strong> via its ground multi-hit combos.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Crowd Control:</strong> Thanks to the staff's hitboxes, these combos work well as crowd control attacks, hitting enemies behind and to the sides of Yakumo, making it invaluable against enemies that swarm Yakumo in greater numbers.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Bloodraven Form Attacks:</strong> The massive hammer into which the staff turns into in Bloodraven mode has surprisingly fast and strong attacks. By pressing A/Cross, Yakumo can also launch high in the air to escape pressure and unleash damaging downward AOE attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downside</strong><strong>s</strong>: The Magatsuhi staff doesn't have easy access to a basic launcher attacker, mostly forcing a grounded playstyle. Its most damaging combos also require long execution times which are often interrupted at Hard and Master Ninja difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Yatousen isn't a bad weapon, but every other weapon in the game does what it does, and better</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-yatousen">Yatousen</h3>



<p>The Yatousen rapier is an interesting weapon characterized by its exceptional <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mobility and speed</strong>. However, its overall usability is extremely limited by a few core design conflicts.</p>



<p><strong>Key Strengths:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Mobility: Many of the Yatousen combos have great mobility, which can help Yakumo get out of danger while keeping up the pressure</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Downsides:</strong> The lack of a quick launcher to set up Izuna Drops, the low attack power in base form and the limitations of Bloodraven form, which requires Yakumo to stand still to deal max damage in any combo string, make it a situational weapon that works best against bosses only in Bloodraven form.</p>
