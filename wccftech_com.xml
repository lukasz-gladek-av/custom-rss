			<p>Gearbox Software has <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1973781293344403545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a new Borderlands 4 patch</a> that introduces auto-clearing of 'stale shaders' upon a version update for the game. According to the developers, this should fix the performance degradation issue some PC players have been experiencing over time. Beyond that, this is largely a balance-focused update that buffs several Vault Hunters, chiefly Amon:</p>



<p><em>For today's update, we wanted to focus on creating greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills. Amon in particular gets a host of adjustments to bring him closer in line with the general power level of the other Vault Hunters. Vex's summons and Rafa's melee power see adjustment to make those builds more viable in the late endgame. Finally, Harlowe has a couple tweaks to make sure Stasis is getting value for players.</em></p>



<p><em>Looking to the future, we're investigating stats and behaviors on Class Mods, Rep Kits, Shields, and Firmware to make sure they are providing avenues to greater build diversity. We are also planning to fix a number of unintended interactions. These exploits prevent us from creating meaningful build diversity as they trivialize content that is otherwise meant to challenge players.</em></p>



<p>The patch also makes a few changes to the Weekly Activities in Borderlands 4. The Big Encore Boss is now a tougher variant of a different existing boss, and it'll come with an even better loot pool. This week, the boss you want to tackle for this activity is Driller Hole.</p>



<p>The Weekly Wildcard Missions have also been buffed, providing a guaranteed Legendary drop that can be repeatedly earned to obtain the 'ideal roll'. This week, the Wildcard Mission is Means of Ascent (Deflector, Tricky, Cold Hearted), and its reward is the Star Helix - Legendary Daedalus Assault Rifle. Finally, the studio shared a picture hint to the whereabouts of Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 was supposed to launch today on Nintendo Switch 2, but Gearbox suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed this version indefinitely (canceling existing pre-orders, too) on September 23</a>. Earlier this week, the studio also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-debuts-first-new-vault-hunter-borderlands-4-paid-story-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a glimpse at the first post-launch Vault Hunter, C4SH</a>, a former casino bot whose abilities will all revolve around the element of luck.</p>

			<p>Earlier today, Starbreeze Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-co-op-game-project-baxter-canceled-starbreeze/">shared that it cancelled Project Baxter</a>, its Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/">project that was first announced back in 2023</a>, so it could focus more on its flagship franchise, Payday. The cancellation resulted in the studio laying off 44 developers. Also today, Starbreeze hosted an anniversary stream to celebrate the second anniversary of the launch of Payday 3, where general manager Jonas Skantz and community manager Elisabeth Elvestad kicked off the stream by confirming that the highly anticipated offline mode for Payday 3 is no longer on its way.</p>



<p>The live stream, which was hosted on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2581219810">official Payday Twitch channel</a>, was intended to talk about the future of Payday 3 and what's in store for the game, which is why Elvestad started by asking Skantz the question that was on the minds of Payday fans all tuning in live, "<em>What's going on with offline mode for Payday 3?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I thought we were friends</em>," Skantz joked to Elvestad, before he began to give what was ultimately a very disappointing answer in the eyes of many players.</p>



<p>"<em>So offline mode. Let's talk about that. I know that the team had good intentions with that, definitely. And they have been trying to make it happen, but I think we have to face the reality that it is not feasible for where we are going with the game. I'll explain what I mean. First of all, we have a finite amount of people. We want to ensure that they work on the most valuable things for the game; these are the things that we will talk about: progression, core loops and so on. But more importantly, we today have an update model where it takes us weeks to get a client update out. This is a bit technical; it means that if we discover today that, 'hey, this value is wrong,' it takes us a very long time to fix that. That's not because we are slow, it's just because updating the first-party and so on, it takes weeks.</em>"</p>



<p><em>"So we want to move to a model where we can work with the community and make sure that we can update things fast, and to do that, we need to update things from the backend. So we need to be able to tweak the game from the backend to make sure we can get things out faster. If we can get at things more early, and have the confidence that we can change it, then that would give us much more speed. It would also bring more meaning to player feedback. That doesn't mean that we are not doing things to improve online, but that's what makes it not feasible to do.</em>"</p>



<p>It's a confusing message to see 44 developers cut from the studio, to turn around and say the studio doesn't have the bandwidth to develop a previously promised offline mode. It gets even muddier shortly after Skantz and Elvestad move on to what's coming in Payday 3, and Skatnz claims the studio is "<em>more than doubling the team to give us the bandwidth to actually do a lot of things we're going to talk about today</em>."</p>



<p>If you're a player who was waiting for offline mode, you can't really be blamed for feeling confused by all of this. Sure, the team members who were working on Project Baxter could have had completely different development skillsets, but it's difficult to believe that the studio's hands are tied in this case and not in others.</p>



<p>In fairness, Payday 3's biggest issue isn't the lack of an offline mode. Since its abysmal launch, it's biggest problem has been a lacking amount of content, especially when compared to Payday 2. Starbreeze needs to give players more reasons to jump to Payday 3 instead of just playing the same heists they already know and love in Payday 2.</p>



<p>Perhaps one day, when Payday 3 is sunset, an offline mode will be part of that process. But that's just speculative hope, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/1nw4ba3/yaall_need_better_standards_if_you_thought_that/">based on how the community has reacted to today's stream</a>, it's worth wondering if anyone will be around to care about Payday 3 getting an offline mode, even if it happens. </p>
