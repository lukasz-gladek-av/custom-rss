			<p>Three former Ubisoft executives have been given suspended prison sentences in a harassment trial that began in March and was delayed until June. </p>



<p>First reported by French publication <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/07/02/harcelement-chez-ubisoft-trois-anciens-cadres-condamnes-a-des-peines-allant-jusqu-a-trois-ans-de-prison-avec-sursis_6617387_4408996.html">Le Monde</a>, former vice president of editorial and creative services, Thomas François, was found guilty of moral and sexual harassment and attempted sexual assault. He was fined €30,000 and given a three-year suspended prison sentence. </p>



<p>Former chief creative officer at Ubisoft, Serge Hascoët, was accused of making lewd and racist comments and of allegedly harassing a Muslim employee by replacing her desktop background with images of food and placing food on her desk while she was fasting for Ramadan. He was fined €45,000 and received an 18-month suspended prison sentence. </p>



<p>Lastly, former game designer at Ubisoft, Guillame Patrux, was accused of psychological harassment and given a 12-month suspended prison sentence and a €10,000 fine. </p>



<p>Patrux, Hascoët, and François, were all part of the toxic culture Ubisoft had allowed to fester that employees called out in 2021 with an open letter from employees calling for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-workers-support-activision-blizzard-employees/">A Better Ubisoft</a>. While Activision Blizzard employees were calling out the leaders who perpetuated ABK's own toxic culture, Ubisoft employees stood up to support workers at Activision Blizzard King, while also calling out their own studios issues. </p>



<p>A year later, Ubisoft employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-a-better-ubisoft-worker-demands-not-met-25-percent-quit/">called out chief executive officer Yves Guillemot</a> for seemingly not responding to the demands staff had made to improve the company culture, while claiming that he took the issues they had raised<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-acknowledges-employees-letter-promises-new-update-in-q3-employees-claim-their-demands-were-sidelined/"> "<em>seriously</em>."</a></p>



<p>One of the key issues employees raised was that when issues with executives like Hascoët were brought forward, rather than that executive losing their job, they were transferred to another position in Ubisoft's global team. It's worth noting that Hascoët was never officially fired from the company, and instead resigned, reportedly after a conversation was had regarding the allegations against him.</p>
