			<p>It's been around <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-physx-goes-open-source-4-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six and a half years</a> since the NVIDIA PhysX SDK went open source under the 3-Clause BSD license. However, not all of it was actually open source. This changed only recently, with the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX/releases/tag/107.0-physx-5.6.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release on GitHub</a> of the GPU simulation kernel source code. Here's the message shared by NVIDIA, along with the release of the shader implementation of the Flow SDK:</p>
<p><em>We’re excited to share that the latest update to the PhysX SDK now includes all the GPU source code, fully licensed under BSD-3!</em></p>
<p><em>With over 500 CUDA kernels powering features such as rigid body dynamics, fluid simulation, and deformable objects, GPU PhysX represents one of the most advanced real-time simulation use cases of CUDA and GPU programming. We hope this release will be a valuable resource for learning, experimentation, and development across the community.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, we’re also open-sourcing the full GPU compute shader implementation of the Flow SDK, our real-time, sparse grid–based fluid simulation library.</em></p>
<p>NVIDIA PhysX is a name we haven't used for a long while until very recently, when users found out that NVIDIA had dropped support for the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. This caused users to seek unorthodox solutions, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/user-combines-rtx-3050-rtx-5090-massive-boost-nvidia-physx-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pairing an RTX 50 GPU with an RTX 3050 dedicated solely to PhysX</a>.</p>
<p>This only really affects a few old PC games, like Batman: Arkham Asylum and Mirror's Edge. Still, the release of the GPU simulation kernel source mode means modders could fix the problem entirely if they so choose. Needless to say, it would have been better if NVIDIA had fixed the issue themselves, but at least this open source release gives modders the chance to do something about it. Of course, we'll keep an eye on any mod releases that take advantage of the newly available GPU simulation kernel source code.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">Lost Skies</a>, the upcoming survival adventure co-op game that involves flying from one airborne island to the next, has a date set for its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> early access release: April 18, 2025. The news came from developer Bossa Games with a release date trailer showing off more gameplay and beauty shots for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Skies | Release Date Reveal Trailer | Humble Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vt9IdgLkvWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A playable build of Lost Skies was available during February's Steam Next Fest, and according to a press release from Bossa Games, it was one of the more popular titles during the festival. An uplifting note for the studio, to be sure, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-scales-back-team-focusing-on-lost-skies-development/">Bossa Games announced layoffs</a> at the top of the year.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear how many developers were laid off at the time, just that there were 40 team members left at Bossa Games to get Lost Skies across the finish line. It'll be interesting to see how the game's launch goes. Early access games are expected to not be perfect at launch, but it definitely couldn't have been easier to prepare Lost Skies for April 18th with fewer people working on the game.</p>
<p>At the time, Bossa Games co-chief executive officer Henrique Olifiers said that the layoff was so the team could focus on "<em>the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future.</em>" A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">gameplay trailer</a> had been showcased for Lost Skies only two weeks ahead of the layoff announcement.</p>
<p>That said, its popularity during Next Fest adds to the proof that Lost Skies is striking a chord with players. For Bossa Games' sake, hopefully, the early access launch will continue the momentum the Next Fest demo kicked up. The team aims to launch version 1.0 before the end of the year, though of course, this will depend on player feedback.</p>
