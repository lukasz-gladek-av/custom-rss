<p>Following the release of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Maiden of Black Water</em> in 2015, the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame</em> series returned in 2021 with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/project-zero-maiden-of-black-water-2021-review/">a remake of the Wii U exclusive</a></strong> followed by a remake of <strong><em>Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</em> in 2023</strong>, which made it possible for many to get acquainted with this unique survival-horror series for the first time. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">With no new entry in the series on the horizon</strong>, it will be up to another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remake</strong>,<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>, to bring the series again to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">modern hardware </strong>this March.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fatal-Frame-2-Crimson-Buttefly-Remake-story-screenshot-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With a great horror story, Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake remains a very engaging experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For those not in the know, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> not the first remake of the second entry in the series</strong>, which originally launched on PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2003/2004. In 2012, the game made the jump to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Wii</strong>, blossoming from its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fixed-camera</strong> state reminiscent of the first few Resident Evil and Silent Hill games into an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">over-the-shoulder third-person</strong> game blended with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">motion controls</strong> via the Wii Remote that suited the Camera Obscura mechanics well. The<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> enhanced visuals</strong> also served the experience quite well, making it way more eerie and immersive.</p>



<p><em>Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> is another enhancement of the experience, with <strong>modern visuals</strong> powered by the Katana engine for an even more immersive experience, and <strong>plenty of quality-of-life improvements</strong> to enhance gameplay to the highest possible degree. <strong>Having only played the original PlayStation 2 release</strong> once back in the day, it is impossible for me to judge <strong>how an early build of the remake I had the chance to try compares to the Wii Edition</strong>. <span>What I can say, however, </span>is that this remake, which sits between innovation and tradition, is set to deliver&nbsp;a <strong>very engaging experience</strong>, if one can look past a combat system that does feel more frustrating than fun, at least in the beginning of the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fatal-Frame-2-Crimson-Butterfly-Remake-gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Buttefly Remake features some very traditional survival-horror gameplay mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Much like the original</strong>,&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>&nbsp;stars the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">twin sisters Mio and Mayu Amakura</strong>, whose relationship has been <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">strained</strong> by a childhood accident, as they are led to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Minakami Village</strong>, a mysterious place where people are said to</span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> disappear without a trac</span>e</strong>, by a crimson butterfly. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">As they explore the village, the two siblings will discover the mysterious<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;Camera Obscu</strong>ra, which lets them see and fight ghosts, and learn the truth behind the disappearances, which seem&nbsp;</span>tied to an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ancient and dark ritual</strong>. Like in the original, the player's choices will shape the siblings' destiny among different possibilities, offering <strong>great replayability</strong></p>



<p>While I only <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">experienced the recreation of the first four chapters in the game</strong>, I couldn't help but remember how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gripping</strong> Fatal Frame 2 can be from the start. The combination of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> cutscenes and environmental storytelling</strong>, which relies heavily on finding documents scattered throughout the village, has only become more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">powerfu</strong>l in the remake thanks to enhanced visuals that bring Minakami Village to life like never before. Some of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">pre-rendered cutscenes</strong> focusing on past events do seem to be a simple upscale of those of the Wii Edition cutscenes as they feature some rather simple character models that starkly contrast with the high-quality new models, but they do not detract much from immersion, being often very filtered.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260203180008_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The visual improvements of Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Buttefly Remake over the previous versions of the game are considerable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Focused on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">offering players a chance to experience <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</em> for the first time</strong>, it's not surprising to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">traditional gameplay feels</strong>. Besides featuring the aforementioned <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">documents and journals</strong> scattered around providing additional details on the world and lore, the remake of the second entry in the series features <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">every staple of the survival horror genre</strong> since its establishment: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">moderately intricate level design</strong> with multiple paths, locked doors requiring keys, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">limited resources</strong> upon which the survival aspect is based, and <strong>a stalker enemy</strong> that cannot be defeated. The first few chapters of the game are not <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">very challenging</strong> at Normal difficulty, so those who have never played an entry in the series before will have <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">enough time</strong> to adjust to some of the quirks of the experience</p>



<p>The one element that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">distinguishes</strong> the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame</em> series from every other survival-horror series is the aforementioned <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Camera Obscura</strong> camera, which remains a core element in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>. With this mysterious camera, Mio can fight hostile ghosts and be guided to the next story objective by more friendly ones.</p>



<p>The game's entire <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">combat system</strong> is centered on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Camera Obscura</strong>, requiring players to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">take the best pictures of ghosts</strong> to defeat them. <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">With&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">different film types</strong>&nbsp;coming with different attack power and reload speed,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">special shots</strong>&nbsp;are possible with any of the four available filters (which must often be used to progress in the story as well) that can blind or slow ghosts, and mechanics that the game's combat system can get rather&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tactical</strong>.</span> However, t<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">he in-game tutorials don't offer anything beyond a rough explanation of the combat mechanics</strong>, which can lead to frustration. </p>



<p>Thankfully, the remake features a proper <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">dodge maneuver</strong> whose addition is quite welcome, as the game wants the player to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">take pictures of ghosts as they are about to attack</strong> for maximum efficacy, thus alleviating some of the combat frustrations. An <strong>upgrade system</strong> for the Camera Obscura and its filters can also make a huge difference, so, at the very least,<strong> the remake offers tools</strong> to make combat slightly faster and less frustrating. Those looking to enjoy the game's story with minimal challenge can play it on<strong> Easy mode</strong>, which I expect will be popular among newcomers to the series.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260203183318_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Camera Obscura is a core element of the experience, and is used for both combat and story progression</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although I am not too fond of the game's combat, <em>Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> delivers an <strong>immediately engaging survival-horror experience</strong>. As such, I am really looking forward to continuing the game and <strong>deciding the fate of Mio and Mayu</strong> when the game launches on <strong>March 12</strong> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p><strong>Sony</strong> hosted its hour-long <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">February 2026 State of Play</a></strong> today, and while plenty of the announcements were surprises, some of them, like the new <strong>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</strong> reveal, we had a heads up on. After its Steam page was accidentally updated to include additional information, like how the game will feature <strong>20 characters at launch</strong>, it seemed like a safe bet that it would be featured during today's event.</p>



<p>Not only was it shown off, but we got another look at more gameplay with this trailer, specifically featuring the <strong>Unbreakable X-Men,</strong> with <strong>Storm, Magik, Wolverine,</strong> and <strong>Danger</strong> all joining the roster of playable fighters in Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. We also got the introduction of <strong>Episode Mode</strong>, a story-driven mode that combines Japanese manga and American-style comics to create a unique blend of storytelling.</p>



<p>And, perhaps most significantly for fighting game fans, we now have an <strong>August 6, 2026</strong>, PC and PS5 release date to look forward to.</p>



<p>It's the first team reveal for the game, and a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-arrives-on-ps5-pc-august-6/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that went live alongside the trailer digs a bit into the game's narrative, with Storm, Magik, Wolverine, and Danger being the only X-Men capable of continuing the fight as a new threat looms over Earth, after a recent battle left the rest of the squad with limited strength. </p>

<p>"<em>Viewed with suspicion and persecuted as “others,” mutants face hostility from humanity. Despite this, the reborn X-Men press on, driven by inner conflict as they strive to protect even the humans who persecute them from the looming threat.</em> <em>What decisions the team will make, and how their story will conclude, is something we hope you look forward to discovering</em>," writes producer <strong>Takeshi Yamanaka</strong>.</p>



<p>Regarding the Episode Mode, we won't be getting traditional cutscenes in different animation styles. Instead, the game's narrative will be shown "<em>as motion comics, centred around manga illustrated by celebrated artists</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, while we got to see a lot of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls here, what we didn't get any hint of is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/"><strong>FlexStrike</strong> fight stick</a> <strong>PlayStation</strong> has previously showcased alongside Marvel Tokon. It was theorized that the fight stick will arrive alongside Marvel Tokon, and its absence from today's showcase may be an indication that it won't make the August launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more information on both the FlexStrike and the rest of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls' full roster soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Housemarque Shows Off More Saros Gameplay at the State of Play Ahead of April 2026 Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/housemarque-shows-off-more-saros-gameplay-at-the-state-of-play-ahead-of-april-2026-launch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With <strong>Saros</strong> getting an <strong>April 30, 2026, </strong>release date confirmation during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">The Game Awards 2025</a>,</strong> it seemed like a lock to be included during today's <strong>February 2026 State of Play</strong>, and it was. <strong>Housemarque</strong> did not disappoint, making a major show of more gameplay from Saros as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Today's trailer dug deeper into the game's systems and focused more on what Housemarque means by its "<em>come back stronger</em>" mantra for Saros' gameplay style. We got a look at how you'll upgrade your armor via the Armor Matrix with resources you gather on your runs, and how you'll choose your upgrades to suit your playstyle. </p>



<p>We also got a look at the fast travel system, which lets you travel to any biome you've already unlocked. You can try and complete everything in one go, but thankfully, you're no longer forced to, as you can head directly to the biome you left off at. Of course, <strong>Returnal</strong> players will remember that you didn't have to play through the entirety of a biome once you have defeated the boss, but this is now a more direct solution, so you can pick up where you left off.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We also got a look at how the Eclipse corrupts weapons and artifacts in the game, and how, on top of the onslaught of enemies you'll face, you'll have to push through the effects of the Eclipse to survive. It even changes certain biome properties, like making marsh water in one of the biomes come alive and burn you when it's active. Hostiles will also fire projectiles that have been corrupted by the Eclipse at you when it's active, doing even more damage than they would without it.</p>



<p>Housemarque promised to have more coming between now and launch, so if you don't feel like you've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/">your fill of Saros showcases</a>, stay tuned.</p>
