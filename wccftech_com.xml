			<p>Today, it's been announced that Summer Game Fest will be returning to Los Angeles from June 6 to June 9 for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/">fifth year in a row</a>. Summer Game Fest will have a Live Kickoff show from YouTube Theater hosted by Geoff Keighley, the man who famously hosts The Game Awards. SGF will be kicking off with a magnificent bang as a live, in-person, 2-hour showcase event will be taking place to begin the event. For those who can't attend in person, it will be streamed across more than 20 video platforms, including commonly used YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, and Steam.</p>
<p>For those who want to attend the event in person, the public ticket sales will begin later in the Spring. Summer Game Fest is a major event, and last year saw it deliver more than 36 million global livestreams, up by 12% Year-on-Year, as well as over 8,000 co-streams on Twitch and YouTube. With the showcase happening at the start of the event, there is the potential for SGF to be even bigger and better than before.</p>
<p>2025 will be introducing a couple of new features, including a business-to-business thought leader event, which will explore and investigate some of the changes, challenges, and opportunities present in the video game industry. During this event, the cultural impact and significance of video games will be celebrated, with the event being curated by Christopher Dring, the former head of GamesIndustry.biz, and Geoff Keighley.</p>
<p>As Summer Game Fest usually does, it will be supporting and uplifting the voices of publishers as well as hosting partner events and livestreams during the weekend of Summer Game Fest. This includes the well-known event of Day of the Devs, which is a special non-profit showcase that celebrates the magic of indie games. As it will be taking place during SGF, the event is called Day of the Devs: SGF Edition and will be presented online via a livestream after the live showcase takes place on June 6.</p>
<p>More information about the event can be found on the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Summer Game Fest website</a>, as well as their social media.</p>

			<p>BetaDwarf, the publisher and developer behind Forced, Forced Showdown, and Minion Masters, has announced their latest title. The game was previously under the codename Project F4E and has now been announced as Vaultbreakers. The game promises to be a new take on <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-the-new-visceral-arpg-from-oris-moon-studios-early-access-launch-in-q1-2024/">ARPGs</a> and PvPvE games. You'll get to experience brawler combat with tactical extractions in an evolving fantasy world. If this sounds like something you'd want to play, make sure to check out the reveal trailer for Vaultbreakers below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vaultbreakers - Reveal Trailer - Join the Playtest" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OgdcqiVQgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Vaultbreakers is a hardcore top-down PvPvE ARPG where you can choose to fight off enemies alongside your friends or by yourself as you take on intense missions in a dynamic fantasy world. This game stands out from the crowd thanks to its reactive gameplay. You will get to take on missions that will shift and change based on the choices made by players, as well as actions taken by NPCs. You'll get to explore new environments, such as caves, and uncover ancient rituals.</p>
<p>To keep the combat fresh and keep you on your toes, the enemies will be unpredictable. They are named Changelings, a faction of shapeshifters that can either be controlled by AI or other players, making the battle even harder. You have multiple choices in how you deal with them, with the options to attack them, avoid them entirely, or align with them.</p>
<p>There will be various Champions you can choose from, as well as new perks, items, and Artifacts that can help make you more powerful on your expedition through Vaultbreakers. For those who have a competitive streak, there's also the option to participate in quests to be able to climb leaderboards and get the top ranking among other players.</p>
<p>"The game is set in an evolving world that challenges players to think tactically, adapt dynamically, and battle fiercely. With unpredictable events triggered by Changelings or other players, and with a focus on player skill and knowledge, I believe we are offering a fresh new multiplayer ARPG experience," says Steffen Kabbelgaard, CEO and Game Director at BetaDwarf.</p>
<p>If all of these features are ticking the boxes for you, BetaDwarf will be hosting an exclusive closed playtest of Vaultbreakers on January 31. If you want to get the opportunity to play the game, you can request access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306910/Vaultbreakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a> or through the <a href="https://vaultbreakers.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Vaultbreakers' website</a>. For content creators that partner up with BetaDwarf, Twitch Drop campaigns will be opened to allow players to get a key for the playtest.</p>
<p>The playtest will consist of the first and second chapters of the narrative campaign. Those who get the opportunity to participate will be able to earn Legacy Points that can unlock rewards that will carry over to the official launch.</p>

			<p>Hyper Light Breaker is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest game to be released</a> by Heart Machine, the masterminds Hyper Light Drifter. This time, you have to enter the Overgrowth, battle off enemies, and bring resources back to your base to help build it up, where you will then be able to upgrade weapons and gear accordingly. If you're a tad overwhelmed by all of the different things you can do in this game, this guide will give you some tips and tricks for starting Hyper Light Breaker and how to push forward.</p>
<p>You can check out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-preview-lo-fi-roguelite/"> preview here</a>.</p>

<h2>Tips for Starting Hyper Light Breaker</h2>
<p><strong>Take your time to explore and gather materials</strong>. Doing this in your first few cycles is essential, as it helps you get a feel for the land, and also helps you work out the value of the materials that you gather in these cycles. While the game may push for you to take on Crowns, don't worry about taking them on in the early game. As with any roguelite, you need to build yourself up before you can get to that point. Using the first few cycles to grind resources and get used to the game is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade your MedKits</strong>. While at first it may seem like a trivial upgrade, trust me when I say that you will need them. To be able to do so, you will need a specific resource called a&nbsp;<strong>Golden Ration</strong>. This will be rewarded to you after your objective completion has been assessed. If you manage to fill up the bar that appears on the screen, this is when you'll be awarded a Golden Ration. This resource is used for a lot of things in the game, including gear upgrades. While those are equally beneficial, making sure that you can heal yourself and not lose all of your farmed materials in the early game is essential.</p>
<p><strong>Utilize your Extractions. </strong>While it may seem like a bad idea to extract from the Overgrowth, it's actually incredibly beneficial to ensure your growth in the game. Extraction is also great because you don't lose Rez or durability, and you can go back to your hub to sell items, make space in your inventory, or upgrade your gear as necessary. With Hyper Light Breaker being a roguelike, it does mean that you will have to fight off enemies and a mini-boss to be able to extract from the Overgrowth, but the small battle is worth it to be able to come home victorious.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer is easier</strong>. Typically, multiplayer can make things more challenging. However, in games like Hyper Light Breaker and Risk of Rain 2, multiplayer can prove to be beneficial. It can help you explore with ease, and you may find that you aren't as quickly overwhelmed by enemies. Even if you don't have friends who are willing to play with you, there are plenty of public lobbies you can choose from, and you may even make a friend by playing with them.</p>
<p>Good luck in the Overgrowth!</p>
