			<p>So far, GTA London 1969 remains the only installment in the franchise to take place outside of the United States. Fans have long wondered if Rockstar would ever return to London or perhaps even bring the series elsewhere in the world. </p>



<p>However, based on the statement relayed by Dan Houser (who wrote all the games in the series save for the upcoming sixth), that seems unlikely. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, he explained that the franchise is intrinsically linked to American culture. </p>



<p><em>We made a little thing in London 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down for the PS1. That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Houser <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-dan-houser-co-founder-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Rockstar Games in early 2020</a>, so it isn't really up to him anymore. That said, having worked there for twenty-two years, he certainly has a sound inkling as to the way the studio thinks about its prized IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creator-reveals-favorite-character-says-llms-will-be-good-at-cheap-stuff-not-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elsewhere in the interview</a>, Dan Houser mentioned that his favorite character in the series was GTA IV's Niko Bellic, as the most earnest and nicest of all, although he also mentioned CJ from San Andreas and Michael De Santa from GTA V as standout, partly due to the respective voice actors doing a great job at bringing them to life.</p>



<p>Houser then said he isn't worried about generative-trained large language models taking the jobs of writers because he reckons that LLMs can only create cheap, decent stuff, but are unable to come out with new, interesting ideas, which is where 'magic' comes from in writing.</p>

			<p>Although The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski has an excellent deal with CD Projekt Red, The Witcher IV won't feature any new contribution from him.</p>



<p>At a recent book event to promote the new Crossroads of Ravens book, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-author-has-an-excellent-deal-with-the-witcher-4-devs-but-its-rare-for-cd-projekt-to-ask-him-for-advice-anymore/">GamesRadar+</a> asked the Polish author if he helped CDPR with the development of the new entry in the series in any way. The author confirmed that the game won't feature any new contributions from him, adding that it is rare for CDPR to ask him for details nowadays. For earlier games in the series, Andrzej Sapkowski was occasionally asked for advice or additional information on the role, so this definitely sounds like a big change.</p>



<p>Although The Witcher IV won't have any contribution from Andrzej Sapkowski, the relationship between the author and the developer seems healthy. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now,"</em> he said. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Let's hope it stays that way." </em></p>



<p>The original deal both parties signed back in the late 1990s only involved a single, upfront lump sum payment, as the author refused a percentage of profits. In 2018, Sapkowski's legal representative <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-author-million-usd/">demanded approximately $16 million USD in additional royalties from CDPR</a>, which ultimately led to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/">an amicable settlement of the dispute and a new agreement in December 2019.</a></p>



<p>While The Witcher IV won't feature any new contribution from Andrzej Sapkowski, his novels will continue to influence the new entry in the series, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/">it will take some cues from Crossroads of Ravens</a>, a prequel book covering Geralt's first foray into the difficult job of a witcher. </p>



<p>Having seen the massive respect CDPR has for the author's works and the lore he created, I am personally not too worried about the next entry in the series deviating from the established canon, even without Andrzej Sapkowski's involvement. Unlike some other adaptations that have chosen to stray from the source material in the worst possible way, CDPR has consistently demonstrated a deep commitment to translating the spirit and details of Sapkowski's world onto the screen, so it will be really interesting to see how the studio overcomes <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-challenge-ciri-important-geralt/">the challenge of convincing players that Ciri is just as important as Geralt</a>, something that book readers already know well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>GTA creator Dan Houser, a co-founder of Rockstar Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-dan-houser-co-founder-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously left the company in early 2020</a> after a twenty-two-year career. The following year, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-creator-dan-houser-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded a new company called Absurd Ventures</a>, which has so far released <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/abetterparadise/audiofiction/podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a podcast series</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/43G4zWS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a graphic novel</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/4nAQwZR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a novel</a>, with games also in development.</p>



<p>Houser, who wrote all Rockstar videogames from GTA London: 1969 to Red Dead Redemption 2, was recently featured in a massive, nearly three-hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video interview on the Lex Fridman podcast</a>. As you'd imagine with such a lengthy conversation, it spanned a myriad of topics, from games to films to the process of creating game characters. Out of all of them, the writer picked Niko Bellic, the Serbian immigrant who served as the protagonist of GTA IV, as his favorite.</p>



<p><em>I think he's the most innovative and the most morally defensible in some ways. He does a lot of stuff where he's fighting for what's right. He's the nicest person in some ways. Is he the best protagonist of a GTA game? I think he's the most innovative protagonist of a GTA game. Structurally, he might be too nice in some ways. He's also tough. I loved CJ in San Andreas. I thought Maylay did such… Just the way he spoke gave him such humanity. It wasn't the writing, it was the quality of the voice acting, it was just so strong for him.<br>I think aspects of Michael, he was so understated, but the actor loved the character, he brought so much humanity to this character who's so flawed, who has no principles. He sells everyone out. I think Ned Luke did such an amazing job and didn't necessarily get as many plaudits as Steven Ogg for Trevor, who was also wonderful. But I think the Ned Luke character anchors that game so much. So I like all of them in different ways, but I probably love Niko the most.</em></p>



<p>Regarding the secret of the GTA series, Dan Houser said that the fact that the games did not come out as often was a factor in their success, driving anticipation which, in turn, drives sales for the next installment. Indeed, he predicts that Grand Theft Auto VI (which he didn't write for) will sell 'really well' when it comes out next year <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on May 26, 2026</a>. Of course, there's also the aspect of Rockstar constantly trying to innovate and push the boundaries of the medium forward.</p>



<p>The GTA creator also commented on the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in particular, saying he's not too worried as they are unable to come up with 'magic' and will most likely be relegated to making decent, cheap stuff.</p>



<p><em>Based on my fairly limited understanding of how language models work, they're not going to replace good ideas. They can't really come up with good new ideas. What they can do is do low-level stuff. So I think it's going to be harder for people to start out in some of these spaces. If you're not a very good concept artist, you're in a lot of trouble. If you have original ideas, I think you're fine. But I also think that they've done the first 90% of the work to sound human, 95% possibly in some areas. The last 5% is going to end up being about 95% of the work. I think that last bit with tech, in my experience with things like facial animation, it's always been the last bits and pieces that take far longer than the first bit. </em></p>



<p><em>And so I'm probably a hideous Luddite, but I'm less scared than a lot of people. I think you're going to end up with a lot of work that looks the same. It's going to help people be creative in some ways. It's going to get some people who probably shouldn't be in that space out of that space. But if you've got talent, I think it'll be fine. I don't think they're going to come up with magic. I think they're going to be fantastic at coming up with really cheap, decent stuff.</em></p>



<p>On that note, one of his new settings, <a href="https://wccftech.com/american-caper-a-better-paradise-gta-creator-dan-houser-absurd-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Better Paradise</a>, is a near-future dystopia where Houser explores characters such as a conflicted, semi-sociopathic AI named Nigel Dave, which knows everything but lacks wisdom of its own and envies the human experience. Houser confirmed that a game based on A Better Paradise is in early development at Absurd Ventures' Santa Monica studio. Moreover, an open world videogame based on a third setting, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-co-founder-dan-houser-teases-his-new-game-with-cast-of-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Absurdaverse</a>, is also in the works but will take a few years before it's ready.</p>
