			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/">La Quimera</a> is a new story-driven, sci-fi co-operative shooter from the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, now known as Reburn. We now have a release date set for this new shooter.</p>
<p>It'll be arriving on PC on Steam at the end of this month, on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2025</strong>, though anyone who is keen to try the game as soon as possible can request to be a part of a closed beta test the studio is hosting for 24 hours beginning this Saturday, April 12, 2025. You can register your interest for the beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>La Quimera takes players to a dystopian version of Latin America in the year 2064, where most of the global systems we know today have collapsed, and humanity continues on in fractured segments around the world. It's a confusing and chaotic time, but it's also the golden age for private mercenary forces, which is where you come in.</p>
<p>That setting is also what lends the game to its cooperative experience while also being a story-driven game. You can play through the story with two friends alongside you, taking advantage of all the futuristic gadgets you'll have, like exoskeletons that make you stronger and faster and weapons that are unlike any of the killing machines we have today.</p>
<p>Along with announcing the release date, Reburn also revealed a new gameplay trailer, which you can check out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera -  Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVCU_hdG3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, Reburn's chief executive officer and co-founder, also added in the announcement that "<em>Our Reburn team can't wait to finally share our hard work and vision for La Quimera on April 25. </em><em>[...] As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn't be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we're profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience."</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-death-stranding-movie-has-found-a-writer-and-director-in-a-quiet-place-day-one%E2%80%99s-michael-sarnoski.1157487/</guid>

			<p>When the announcement was made that a<a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/"> Death Stranding film</a> adaptation was in the works, fans immediately assumed that Hideo Kojima would direct the film and potentially even pen the script. Kojima's well-known love for movies and cinema had everyone assuming he'd be in the driver's seat for the adaptation.</p>
<p>That's not the case, though, as Kojima explicitly said at <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/">2024's Tokyo Game Show</a> that he absolutely does not have time to direct the movie himself. He also explained that because he had originally viewed the story of Death Stranding as a game, it wasn't in his interest to "<em>look back at it and try to see it from a movie perspective.</em>"</p>
<p>That is why the search for a director would go beyond Kojima, and as&nbsp;<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-quiet-place-day-one-michael-sarnoski-death-stranding-1236360094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadline</a> reported on Monday, the search is over. Michael Sarnoski, the director of A Quiet Place: Day One and Pig, has been chosen to write and direct the Death Stranding film adaptation.</p>
<p>According to the report, the adaptation will "<em>delve into the mysteries surrounding the 'Death Stranding' - a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.</em>"</p>
<p>It's been more than two years since the film adaptation of Death Stranding was announced, and now that the project has a writer and director confirmed, it'll likely be another two years at least, before we can expect to see any news regarding a release date.</p>
<p>Sarnoski also won't be jumping on the project until he's wrapped up post-production work on his next upcoming film, Death of Robin Hood, which is also being produced by A24. At least now we know that real work on the project can move forward with Sarnoski officially at the helm. The next big question is whether the star-studded cast from the game will return for the film.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kojima Productions is currently finishing its work on Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 26</a> for PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-missing-a-few-big-features-fans-were-hoping-for/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-nvidia-dlss/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is definitely a feature-rich console, with improvements over the original that will make hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of players want to buy the console on day one.</p>
<p>That's not to say the Nintendo Switch 2 will have everything players hoped for. Namely, there are three big features that we now know the Nintendo Switch 2 will be missing that players were hoping for. Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/category/news/">VGC</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 will not feature Hall-Effect sticks in the new Joy-Con 2 controllers. There will also be no console-wide achievements on the Nintendo Switch 2. Lastly, the Nintendo eShop will seemingly remain without life and personality, as Nintendo confirms the iconic eShop music from the Wii days is not coming back.</p>
<p><span>Going from least to most impactful, regarding the eShop's lack of music, the producer on the Nintendo Switch 2, Kouichi Kawamoto, explained to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a> that the reason comes down to games on the eShop now having videos to go along with the screenshots.</span></p>
<p>"<em>Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games. We didn't want to intrude on that, so we don't have music there."</em></p>
<p>Next, regarding the lack of achievements, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen offered no explanation as to why they aren't there, and instead just confirmed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements">Polygon</a>, when asked if there would be achievements, "<em>Nope</em>."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the lack of Hall-Effect sticks,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a> confirmed that the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not feature them. Senior Vice President of Product Development and Publishing Nate Bihldorff gave the final word.</span></p>
<p>"<em>Well, the Joy-Con 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up. They're not Hall-Effect sticks, but they feel really good."</em></p>
<p>So the threat of stick drift remains for the Joy-Con 2 controllers, which are, like everything else about this new console, more expensive than the original Switch controllers. This also confirms that the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">rumor</a> that the Joy-Con 2 controllers would feature Hall-Effect sticks was false.</p>
