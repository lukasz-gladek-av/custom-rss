			<p>During a recent investor meeting, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa addressed the topic of demand for the newly released Switch 2 console. According to Furukawa, it greatly exceeded Nintendo's internal estimates, which is why you may have had trouble finding it in stores. The president even apologized to customers for the inconvenience. Here's the quote, initially <a href="https://x.com/NStyles/status/1938408070784393520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> by X user NStyles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-president-apologises-for-not-being-able-to-meet-switch-2-demand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translated</a> into English by Nintendo Life:</p>



<p><em>Currently, in many countries, the demand for Switch 2 exceeds the supply, and we are unable to meet it. We understand that some shareholders have also been unable to obtain it. We started accepting lottery sales at My Nintendo Store in April. The response far exceeded our expectations, and I announced in my name on X that there were 2.2 million applicants, along with an apology.</em></p>



<p><em>Since then, we have conducted four lottery sales, but some people were not selected. We have announced that the fifth lottery will take place starting in July. Many general retailers have also conducted lottery sales. The number of stores offering in-store sales is gradually increasing. As a company, we are working to improve our production system to deliver as many units as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this initial demand, which greatly exceeded our expectations.</em></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank">sold</a>&nbsp;over 3.5 million units in the first four days, which is</span> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast</a> as its predecessor in the same timeframe. Last week, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">raised</a> its 2025 sales forecast for the new console from 15 to 16 million units. That estimate does include the limited supply, for without that, DFC Intelligence reckons the Switch 2 could sell 20 million units.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Splatoon 3 upgrade introduces some significant improvements that highlight just how much more powerful the new system is compared to its predecessor.</p>



<p><span>Over the weekend, the tech experts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank">Digital Foundry</a>&nbsp;shared their analysis of multiple Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for several original Switch first-party titles like Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda: Link's Awakening, and Echoes of Wisdom, and a few others, highlighting how the games have been improved on the new generation system.</span> The improvements introduced to the vast majority of games, however, don't highlight how much the new console is more powerful than its predecessor as the Splatoon 3 upgrade does. </p>



<p>The Splatoon 3 upgrade bumps the resolution from dynamic 1080p to 4K in docked mode with image quality improvements and, in some scenarios, the Nintendo Switch 2 increases resolution by five, six times, as seen in one instance where the game runs at 864p on the original system, and at 2160p on the new. The upgrade also massively improves the city hub area, which runs at locked 60 FPS on the Nintendo Switch 2, as does the rest of the game. In handheld mode, the upgrade is less of an improvements as the game ran well in the same mode on the original Switch, though the 1080p resolution at locked 60 FPS is still an improvement over the dynamic 720p resolution offered on the original system.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The power of the Nintendo Switch 2 is definitely being put to good use<span> to improve some of the best games released for its predecessor, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/" target="_blank">unpatched games can brute-force some welcome performance improvemen</a>ts.&nbsp;</span>With the exception of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-display-problematic-worse-predecessor/">screen</a>, the system as a whole is a significant improvement over its predecessor, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide</p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod, now available online introduces a highly requested feature that can make the game more enjoyable for users who have lamented the lack of a feature that has become a standard in the past few years.</p>



<p>The Minimap mod developed by paboyafx and now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/383?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, does exactly what its simple name indicates: it adds a fully functional minimap to the game, complete with multiple zoom multiplier options ranging from 0.35x to 3x. As the level design of the amazing role-playing game developed by Sandfall Interactive can get a little confusing at times, this simple mod can be a godsend for those who want to explore the game's locations in their entirety and don't want to rely on old-school methods to avoid getting lost.</p>



<p>To be completely honest, I did not feel much of a need for a minimap in my time with the game, and had tons of fun relying on the environment to avoid getting lost and exploring locations the best I could. This sort of approach to exploration further enhanced what is,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"> in my opinion</a>, one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years.</p>



<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactiveâ€™s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
