			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches in early June worldwide, as many correctly predicted in the past few months.</p>
<p>The next-generation console will officially launch on June 5th, as announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8">Nintendo Direct</a>. While the system's price wasn't confirmed during the presentation, Nintendo revealed in a press release that the system will retail for $449.99 / €469,99, which is a little higher than the price most predicted.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, today's presentation provided additional information on the system. The console will sport a 7.9-inch, 1080p resolution LCD screen complete with 120 FPS and HDR support. The docked experience will also be a marked step up over the previous system, as the new dock will support up to 4K resolution for compatible games, as well as HDR. The dock will have a built-in fan that will keep the system cool in docked mode.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will feature plenty of other improvements over the original system, such as faster and bigger internal storage, 256 GB over the 32 GB offered by the original Switch, two USB-C ports, one on the top and one on the bottom of the system, which will be handy for connecting the newly announced Nintendo Switch 2 camera or for charging the console in tabletop mode.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 and Pro Controller 2 also sport plenty of improvements over their predecessors. The detachable controllers are attached magnetically to the system and feature, as rumored, mouse functionality for both the left and right controllers. The brand-new C button will be used to access a new GameChat feature that brings a flexible chat system to the system that will take advantage not only of the already mentioned Nintendo Switch 2 camera but also of the built-in microphone, allowing Nintendo Switch Online subscribers to use the new chat system without any additional purchase. Until March 31st, 2026, the GameChat system will be available for free for all Switch 2 owners. The Pro Controller 2, on the other hand, now features <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrade-dev-kits/">a headphone jack</a> as well as two additional buttons on the back of the controller which can be programmed.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 audio features have also seen a big improvement over the previous system. Built-in speakers have been greatly improved to offer a much better audio experience, a better experience that will also be provided by 3D audio support.</p>
