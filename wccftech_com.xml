			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">The Game Business</a>, data firm NielsenIQ shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is the biggest Nintendo console launch in the UK ever. Still, it's not the biggest console launch in the region ever, with the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series consoles still ahead of it.</p>
<p>While the report doesn't provide a specific number, The Game Business says the Switch 2 beat out week-one launch sales in the UK for the Nintendo Switch "<em>by more than two to one,</em>" and also pointed out that the Nintendo Switch managed to sell a little more than 80K units in the UK when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo 3DS, which used to have the record for the best UK launch for a Nintendo device, sold 113K units in its launch.</p>
<p>The Game Business also listed the top-10 console launches in the UK by sales units, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now firmly in fourth place. Here's the full list, per The Game Business:</p>
<ol>
<li>PlayStation 5</li>
<li>PlayStation 4</li>
<li>Xbox Series</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2</li>
<li>PlayStation 3</li>
<li>Xbox One</li>
<li>Nintendo Wii</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Xbox 360</li>
<li>Xbox One X</li>
</ol>
<p>Reports from the PS5's UK launch claimed it sold more than <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-ps5-was-the-uks-biggest-ever-console-launch/">250K units in just two days after launch</a>, and more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-best-selling-next-gen-uk/">450K by the end of 2020</a>. So, until any actual sales numbers are reported, we know that the Switch 2 sold more than 113K units and less than 250K.</p>
<p>It didn't set the all-time record for the UK, but there's no denying that somewhere between 113-250K is a very strong launch for just one region. The Switch 2 also might've set all-time records elsewhere, as it's currently claimed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-allegedly-frances-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-over-200k-sold-so-far/">Switch 2 is now France's fastest-selling console ever</a>, and that Nintendo moved 200K units in France in the console's opening weekend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-switch-2-exclusive-splatoon-spin-off-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Big news today for Splatoon fans, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/splatoon-raiders-the-first-ever-splatoon-spinoff-game-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo announced</a> the first Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive Splatoon game with Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off game where players will head to the Spirhalite Islands as a mechanic along with the Deep Cut trio. Nintendo also announced that a new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/">Splatoon 3</a> will be available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on&nbsp;<strong>June 12, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Nintendo announced the news through its Nintendo Today! mobile app, with a short teaser trailer introducing the new adventure. There's not much we know about Splatoon Raiders, like whether it'll be a single-player adventure or if it is a multiplayer-focused game, but the emphasis on the game's core party of characters in this announcement, like the protagonist and the Deep Cut trio, and the short bits of gameplay shown in the trailer seem to suggest it's a narrative-driven title in some sense.</p>
<p>According to a post from the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1932423796964606143">Splatoon America account on X</a>, our protagonist for Splatoon Raiders is "<em>an expert mechanic with a mysterious background. That ink tank and walking robot look rather intriguing, wouldn't you say?</em>"</p>

<p>Nintendo also failed to mention when we can expect to see Splatoon Raiders on store shelves, though, as a Switch 2 exclusive, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo prices the game. Since it's a spin-off title, will it come in closer to, say, $50, or will it be the latest Switch 2 exclusive to be priced at $80?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Splatoon world, and in the same video following the Splatoon Raiders announcement, Nintendo confirmed that Splatoon 3's version 10.0 update will launch later this week, bringing along with it the return of the Urchin Underpass map from the first Splatoon game, a new set of weapons and cosmetics from the Splatlands Collection, new stats for players to track, and most importantly for Switch 2 owners, "<em>more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds</em>" when playing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>The update will also add support for Splatoon 3 cross-play between Switch and Switch 2.</p>
