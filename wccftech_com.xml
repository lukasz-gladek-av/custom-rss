			<p>On one hand, Borderlands 4 had a strong launch. In its opening hours, it had the biggest launch for the entire Borderlands series on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">with over 100K concurrent players on Steam</a>, eventually hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/#max">over 300K on its opening weekend</a>. It hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/">2 million units sold in its opening week</a>, and for September 2025, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">topped sales charts in the US, becoming one of the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far</a>. That said, according to Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick, sales were "<em>softer</em>" than expected.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> that went live shortly after the announcement that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI was delayed</a>, Zelnick also commented on the sales for Borderlands 4. While Zelnick commended the game's critical reception, he called the commercial success of the game "<em>softer</em>" than the company would have liked, and specifically cited the poor performance and myriad of bugs that the game launched with on PC as part of why it has fallen below expectations.</p>



<p>"<em>The critical acclaim [for Borderlands 4] was superb,</em>" Zelnick said, "<em>and we're really happy with the release. Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. So, in terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were a little softer than we would have liked. In the fullness of time, we think it's going to do great</em>."</p>



<p>You may recall that when Borderlands 4 launched and its PC performance was abysmal in many ways, Gearbox boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">Randy Pitchford went on a tirade on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and fought back against players who were rightfully complaining that this new triple-A game they bought wasn't running well on their machines. Pitchford even <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">called the PC version "<em>pretty optimal</em>"</a> when the game was facing well-deserved backlash.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Zelnick is right that Gearbox has been working to address its issues. A patch from a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-october-23-patch-performance-improvements/">specifically improved performance by double-digits</a>. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed</a>, which means we'll have to keep going back to Grand Theft Auto V to get a fix for Rockstar's best-selling franchise. If you're one of the handful of people who have yet to play one of the highest-selling video games ever, it looks like you'll get another chance, at least on PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, Grand Theft Auto V is heading back to the PS Plus Extra games catalogue.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun and Dealabs have a strong track record when it comes to reporting PS Plus games, whether it's one of, or sometimes all three, of the three games offered for the Essential tier, or one of the games entering the catalogue at the Extra tier.</p>



<p>This report pertains to the latter, as we've already had the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november-stray-ea-sports-wrc-24-totally-accurate-battle-simulator/">three games for November at the PS Plus Essential tier</a> revealed (<a href="https://wccftech.com/stray-playstation-plus-november-2025/">one of which Billbil-kun also correctly reported ahead of the official announcement</a>).</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also predicts that this coming Wednesday, November 12, we'll get the official reveal of what games are coming to the PS Plus Extra catalogue, which will include Grand Theft Auto V.</p>



<p>With GTA VI delayed, it lines up perfectly that GTA V would re-enter the PS Plus Extra catalogue, just to make it as accessible as possible for people wanting to remain immersed in the world of Grand Theft Auto on their consoles. It's already available on Xbox Game Pass, so having it back on PlayStation's subscription service just rounds out where players can find it.</p>



<p>Regarding the additional delay for GTA VI, Take-Two boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/">Strauss Zelnick says the company has <em>"never regretted</em>" delaying a game</a>. At least it looks like we'll get another way to play GTA V in the meantime.</p>
