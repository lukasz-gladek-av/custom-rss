			<p>Yesterday, GeForce NOW users started noticing that the billing system was offline. As it turns out, there's a very good reason for that. NVIDIA <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that it is taking over payment processing from a third-party provider. During this transition, existing paid users will effectively be able to play for free. On the flip side, new signups for memberships and upgrades/downgrades from existing plans are paused for the time being. The whole process is expected to last around five weeks.</p>
<p>NVIDIA prepared some answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ):</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Why are all memberships &amp; gift cards sold out right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider. While we work through this transition, new sign ups for memberships &amp; day passes along with gift card purchases will be paused.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Why am I not getting billed?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider and billing is waived while we complete that process. Your account remains in good standing during this transition.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Why can’t I change (upgrade/downgrade) my membership?</strong></em><br>
<em>Membership changes are paused while GeForce NOW transitions to a new payment provider. Recurring billing is waived while we transition payment services and your account remains in good standing.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Can I use a gift card or promo code right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>Gift cards and promotional codes cannot currently be redeemed but will resume soon. For questions or assistance, please contact NVIDIA Customer Care.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Can I purchase additional hours right now?</strong></em><br>
<em>GeForce NOW is transitioning to a new payment provider. While we work through this transition, you will not be able to purchase additional time. Accounts affected by this change have been migrated to an unlimited playtime account. Those users will continue to enjoy unlimited playtime until their first billing cycle on or after January 1, 2026, as long as their Premium membership remains uninterrupted and in good standing once billing resumes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Does this mean GeForce NOW is shutting down?</strong></em><br>
<em>No, GeForce NOW will continue to operate unabated while we transition payment service providers.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>When will I be billed next?</strong></em><br>
<em>Billing will waived for the duration of the transition, pushing back your next billing cycle by the same length of time. We expect the transition will take a minimum of five weeks. Visit your account portal for further updates.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidias-cloud-gaming-service-geforce-now-is-officially-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating its fifth anniversary</a> next week. So far, it delivers the best cloud gaming experience available on the market, thanks to its vast library of games and support for high-end technologies like 4K, 120 FPS, DLSS, HDR, VRR, and even ray tracing for those subscribed to the premium tiers.</p>

			<p>This morning, a Sony press release <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-leadership-at-sony-interactive-entertainment-302362728.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> some changes to the PlayStation leadership. Hideaki Nishino will fully take over the role of President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, effective April 1, 2025. You might recall that last year, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-its-two-new-ceos-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> the mildly confusing two-CEO structure, with Nishino leading the Platform Business Group and Hermen Hulst helming the Studio Business Group. Hulst will retain this position, but he'll now report directly to Nishino.</p>
<p>Moreover, Hiroki Totoki is stepping down as Chairman of SIE to become President and CEO of Sony Group Corporation. At the same time, Lin Tao, currently serving as SVP of Finance, Corporate Development, and Strategy at PlayStation, will step down from her position at SIE to become CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Her successor at SIE will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki, Chairman at Sony Interactive Entertainment and President, COO and CFO at Sony Group Corporation, stated:</p>
<p><em>It has been a pleasure working more closely with Hermen and Nishino and gaining insight into the ever-changing, fast-paced world of Sony Interactive Entertainment. As we hand the baton to Nishino and this exceptional leadership team, I am confident that SIE will reach new heights in the days ahead. After 30 years of delivering exceptional entertainment worldwide, this marks an exciting new chapter for SIE, highlighting its commitment to fostering creativity and building meaningful connections for millions of players. I am delighted to welcome Lin as my successor as CFO of Sony Group Corporation. Lin has been instrumental to our success at SIE, leading the Finance, Corporate Development and Strategy functions, and I look forward to working closely with her at Sony Group Corporation.</em></p>
<p>Hideaki Nishino commented on his new role as the sole CEO of the PlayStation division with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>I am truly honored to take the helm at Sony Interactive Entertainment. Technology and creativity are two of our biggest strengths as we continue to focus on developing experiences that deliver entertainment for everyone. We will continue to grow the PlayStation community in new ways, such as IP expansion, while also delivering the best in technology innovation. I want to thank Hermen for his expertise and leadership as he continues his role as CEO of the Studio Business Group. I am deeply grateful for the PlayStation community and their continued support and I am very excited for what the future holds.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-free-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-on-march-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon Games has <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-us/news/articles/wilds-of-talandre-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the release date for Wilds of Talandre, the first (and free) <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> expansion: March 6. Starting on that date, players of NCSoft's MMORPG will get to explore a brand new zone, which includes new story content, an updated level cap (to 55), and several new events, field dungeons, and field bosses. Following the launch, based on the Milestone system, various additional content will be unlocked in Wilds of Talandre, including new regional events, archbosses, and field dungeons.</p>
<p>There's lots more. The expansion is going to add solo dungeons to Throne and Liberty. This activity is meant to be a way for players to get better before they head into more challenging group content, but it'll come with its own rewards.</p>
<p>Speaking of the aforementioned group content, Wilds of Talandre also brings the third tier of group dungeons. 3-Star Dungeons unlock at level 55 and require a minimum of 3,500 Combat Power. At launch, players can expect the following dungeons to be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rancorwood</li>
<li>Mansion of Tragedy</li>
<li>Chapel of Madness</li>
<li>Cruel Witch's Garden</li>
<li>Assassin's Lab</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential loot drops include the powerful Epic II Gear Sets, Training Dew, Amitoi, Abyssal Contract Token Points, and, of course, crafting materials. Players will also get rewards that can be used to craft items that drop Dimensional Soul Shards in each 3-Star Dungeon.</p>
<p>Throne and Liberty is getting a new cross-server PvPvE activity called Nebula Island. Players can spend up to 7 hours per week on the island, with additional time available through Nebula Charge Stones. The island features a central village (the Resistance Surveillance Camp) and six different regions, including one peaceful zone (the Fog Forest) and four war zones where PvP is always active. Various hunting grounds can be accessed through portals from the Resistance Surveillance Camp. On Nebula Island, players will also find hourly events and periodic limited-participation field boss battles.</p>
<p>The Weapon Mastery system has been revamped, and there's a brand new Artifact System as well. Artifacts can be obtained from Nebula Island and from the Abyss Dungeons in the Talandre region. The system consists of six parts: four Talistones, a Solar Stone, and a Lunar Stone, each with unique stats and effects. There are 14 different Artifact sets across three grades (2 Common, 4 Uncommon, and 8 Rare). Players can trigger set bonuses by equipping 2, 4, or 6 matching pieces from the same set. The Solar Stone provides an Active Skill, while the Lunar Stone grants a Passive Skill when equipped.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wilds of Talandre adds some new lifestyle content: 24 new fish, 4 new fishing rods, new collectibles, and 10 new cooking recipes and food items. Players will also have another reason to gather ingredients in Throne and Liberty as the 5 types of Elixir items (Excellent Attack/Defence Elixirs, Rare Attack/Defence/Purification Elixirs) can now be cooked.</p>

			<p>Last year, fans of adventure games <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were treated to a great release schedule</a>. Can 2025 match or even surpass it? Possibly, thanks to several experienced studios like Don't Nod and Hazelight, which have proved to be masters of the genre time and again. We still don't have a release date for The Wolf Among Us 2; Telltale <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-isnt-canceled-confirms-telltale-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a few months ago that the long-anticipated sequel isn't canceled, but it doesn't sound like it's coming in 2025. Thankfully, in the meantime, there'll be plenty of fun to be had between triple-A and independent productions.</p>

<h2>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage (February 18, April 15)</h2>
<p>The creators of Life is Strange return with a sort of spiritual successor titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>. The story will be split into two episodes, scheduled to be released around two months apart.</p>
<p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is set in the fictional town of Velvet Cove, Michigan, and features four former friends (Nora, Autumn, Kat, and Swann) who are reunited after 27 years. As Swann, players will actually navigate two different timelines: the Summer of 1995, when their friendship blossomed, and 2022, when the group gets together again despite having sworn not to speak again after they had buried a secret together. Don't Nod promises players will be able to shape both timelines somehow, while dialogue will feel more realistic thanks to the ability to ignore or interrupt what the others have just said. Given the studio's pedigree in the adventure games genre, this is likely one of the most widely anticipated titles.</p>

<h2>Split Fiction (March 6)</h2>
<p>After the enormous success of 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won many awards and sold over 20 million copies, Josef Fares and his Hazelight Studio are about to try again with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-split-fiction-trailer-showcases-co-op-gameplay-and-side-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Split Fiction</a>. Once more, this adventure game has been designed specifically to be played in split-screen cooperative multiplayer, so you'll need a friend to experience it.</p>
<p>This time around, the main characters are Mio and Zoe, two writers who work on sci-fi and fantasy, respectively. The beginning of the narrative sees them being trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. They don't really feel much for one another at first, but they must work together if they are to escape this prison, mastering a variety of skills and overcoming various challenges as they jump between the sci-fi and fantasy worlds they had envisioned in their works.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/southofmidnight-1-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>South of Midnight (April 8, PC and Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>The first project developed by Compulsion Games since they were acquired by Microsoft is undoubtedly an action/adventure game with a fair amount of action and puzzles. However, the developers have stressed that the story, rather than the gameplay, is the main focus of <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>. In a fantasy world inspired by Deep Southern Gothic tales, protagonist Hazel suddenly becomes a Weaver, a magic user who repairs broken spirits and bonds.</p>
<p>The stop-motion-inspired visuals are certainly catchy, but Hazel's journey—both across the land and within herself—should take center stage when the game launches in early April.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Karma-The-Dark-World-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>KARMA: The Dark World (TBA)</h2>
<p>Shanghai-based developer Pollard Studio managed to stand out among the sea of upcoming new game releases with its debut project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARMA: The Dark World</a>. The developers described it as a first-person cinematic psychological thriller set in a dystopian 1984 East Germany.</p>
<p>In this alternate timeline, the Leviathan Corporation rules society with an iron fist, controlling its citizens through mass surveillance, strict social class rules, mind-altering drugs, and the promise that the gates to utopia will open for those who obey. As Daniel McGovern, a Roam Agent for Leviathan's Thought Bureau, players will get to use advanced tech to enter the minds of the accused, investigate crime scenes, interview suspects, and report their findings to Leviathan.</p>
<p>Through a combination of investigative tools and interviews, players will solve puzzles and uncover the truth of a dark tale of love, loss, and deception where nothing is what it seems, and every twist and turn brings a new twist to unravel.</p>

<h2>Spirit of the North 2 (TBA)</h2>
<p>The cute fox from 2020's Spirit of the North returns in the sequel to this peculiar adventure game franchise. In Spirit of the North 2, players will be transported to an ancient world in ruins. As a lonely fox, with the help of a wise raven companion, they must find the lost legendary guardians and free them from the grasp of a dark shaman called Grimnir.</p>
<p>These corrupted guardians will have to be defeated and subsequently cleansed in puzzle-based encounters. Developer Infuse Studio also promised a large and ancient open world to explore, filled with history to discover, not to mention challenges to overcome and secrets to unlock.</p>
