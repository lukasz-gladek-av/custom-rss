			<p>Xbox Game Pass is reportedly profitable even when factoring in loss sales of first-party titles available on the service, according to a known business journalist.</p>



<p>Providing a clarification on yesterday's statement revealing that Xbox Game Pass is profitable, taking fees paid to third parties, marketing, and service costs into account, but not lost sales of first-party titles, The Game Business founder Chris Dring stated today on <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring">X</a> that the subscription service is profitable even when factoring these lost sales. 18 months ago, the journalist checked with Xbox what's included in the Game Pass P&amp;L, and was told that first-party games have their own P&amp;L separate to Game Pass as they make money via other means, which may have meant that Xbox Game Pass was profitable but potentially also put pressure on the margins for first-party games, possibly with some studios not making much profit, if any at all. All this, however, was before Xbox games started being released on other consoles, as studios can now make more margins on premium sales. Regardless of all the information above, sources have reached out to Chris Dring to confirm that, even if lost sales of first-party titles and related microtranscations are taken into account, Xbox Game Pass is still profitable.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass's profitability and the impact it has been having on the industry as a whole have been a point of discussion since the service's launch a few years back. No matter its profitability, the impact in terms of loss sales seems to be big, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">estimated</a> earlier this year that games available via the subscription service can lose has much as 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, as was highlighted by how games like Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Starfield failed to make a real splash on sales charts. On the other hand, a multiplatform game available on Xbox Game Pass can have a beneficial impact, as it can be accompanied by increased sales on another format.</p>

			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-announced-for-july-2025/">announcing</a> that Ghost of Yotei would be getting a dedicated State of Play event sometime this month, PlayStation has announced when that State of Play will happen, and it'll take place just two days from now at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>In a new<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/watch-the-ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive-on-july-10/"> PlayStation Blog post</a>, PlayStation has confirmed that the Ghost of Yotei State of Play will take place this Thursday, July 10, 2025, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST. The presentation will be a 20-minute-long deep-dive on Ghost of Yotei's gameplay, and will feature the creative directors from Sucker Punch, Nate Fox and Jason Connell, discussing the gameplay, and showing off "<em>new weapons, new ways to personalize your journey at the edge of Japan, new special modes, and much more</em>," the blog post reads.</p>

<p>We now have less than 100 days to go from now until Ghost of Yotei's previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">October 2, 2025</a>, release date. The follow-up to Sucker Punch's 2019 samurai epic, Ghost of Tsushima currently carries the full weight of PlayStation's first-party fall lineup, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon was delayed</a> from its original September release date and a new release date for it was not announced. </p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the rest of the major games that'll be available to PlayStation players are coming from third-party developers, though of course, there's still time for PlayStation to announce another first-party title coming before the end of the year. Astro Bot, last year's GOTY at The Game Awards wasn't announced until the midway point of the year. That said, we're already past that, so it'll be interesting to see if Sony does have anything else up its sleeve, or if Ghost of Yotei gets to hog the entire fall/winter spotlight for PlayStation.</p>
