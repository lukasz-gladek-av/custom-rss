			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">Steam Next Fest</a> is back, and that means thousands of demos are available on Steam for players to download and potentially find their next favorite game before it's officially out.</p>
<p>I love Steam Next Fest, if for nothing else than the fact that I get to try a bunch of new games for free, and in quick succession, because plenty of these demos don't take any longer than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I played several demos over the course of this week, and these are the ones that I absolutely loved, that you should spend your weekend diving into.</p>
<h3>Mina the Hollower - Developed by Yacht Club Games - Release Date: October 31, 2025 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mina-the-Hollower.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This one is an easy recommendation for me, because I knew I would like it going in. I love platformers, and ever since I played through Shovel Knight, I've paid attention to everything Yacht Club Games has done. When I first heard about Mina the Hollower, I'll admit I was a tad disappointed to not see Yacht Club going back to the drawing board for a new 2D platformer, but my belief in the studio and the first clips of gameplay I saw from Mina convinced me I had nothing to be sad about. This would be a great game that I'd love.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875580/Mina_the_Hollower/">Playing this demo</a> is the first chance I've had to try Mina the Hollower, and now that we have a definitive <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/">release date for it</a>, I can easily say this is my most anticipated game of the year. The burrowing is satisfying to execute, the layout of something more akin to old Zelda games is something I can easily get behind, and I love the pixel art on display here.</p>
<h3>Baby Steps - Developed By Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy - Release Date: September 8, 2025 - PC, PS5</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Baby-Steps-Steam-Next-Fest-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>What do you get when you pair the developers behind QWOP, Getting Over It, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ape-out-rampaging-gorilla/">Ape Out</a> together? A game about a 35-year old man living in his parents' basement who learned to walk by playing QWOP, pretty much.</p>
<p>But what really intrigues me about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2460140/Baby_Steps_Demo/">Baby Steps</a> more than just its wonky and purposely-frustrating walking mechanics is that there's much more to it than just the challenge of taking the next step. It's incredibly funny from the jump, and while the demo doesn't last long enough to necessarily confirm this, it's clear to me that there's a deeper layer of storytelling waiting in the full game. Or, at the very least, there's more humor to come from our protagonist really needing to use the bathroom but being unable to find one. Either way, I'm in.</p>
<h3>Bloodthief - Developed by Blargis - Release Date: TBA - PC</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bloodthief-Steam-Next-Fest.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I loved the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostrunner-death-not-such-terrible/">Ghostrunner</a> game when it came out, but since then, I've yet to find a game that scratched the same itch the first one did. Even the sequel, I thought, didn't do the trick. Which is why I'm thankful for having played Bloodthief, if for no other reason than the game achieving that blend of fast-paced, 3D-platforming and parkouring action and scratching that itch once again.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2533600/Bloodthief/">Bloodthief</a> is a classic, simple-looking, 2-feet-wide, 10-feet-deep kind of game. If you want to dig into the parkour mechanics and push them to their limits, what I've played of its levels so far shows that there's plenty for you to dig into. Even in the opening levels, I was finding alternate paths through the parkouring by simply thinking 'I can make that jump,' and figuring out that I could, if I was nimble enough. It's not the same one-hit-kill style combat as Ghostrunner, but it still plays within the same realm of you can only take so many hits before you have to go back to the checkpoint. I also appreciate the shift from a high-gloss, neon-light-filled cyberpunk world to a muted, medieval setting. It makes the dark red blood really stand out, and it's just more fun to watch armored knights flailing their swords and running at you at full sprint.</p>
<h3>Henry Halfhead - Developed by Lululu Entertainment - Release Date: TBA - PC and Consoles</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Henry-Halfhead-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I love a good, odd, puzzle game that encourages you to find your own solution to a problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058140/Henry_Halfhead/">Henry Halfhead</a> is exactly that, and it has a fun and intriguing core mechanic to boot. Being able to jump into pretty much any object is a fun loop, and I'm hopeful that the full game will feature deeper layers of puzzles.</p>
<p>The ones in the demo aren't bad, they're just introductory, so they're not going to be the most complicated. Still, I left the demo feeling like this could be one of the better puzzle games of the year, depending on how it evolves. As a Steam Next Fest demo though, playing Henry Halfhead is a great way to spend some time, even if you just sit around and listen to a song that starts playing part of the way through, as I did.</p>
<h3>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound - Developed by The Game Kitchen - Release Date: July 31, 2025 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ninja-Gaiden-Ragebound.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Announced at last year's Game Awards, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2542120/NINJA_GAIDEN_Ragebound/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound,</a> to me, is similar to IO Interactive developing a James Bond game. What else could you expect from the developers behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a>, besides something amazing, when you ask them to make a 2D action-platforming Ninja Gaiden game?</p>
<p>Spending some time with this demo pretty much just confirmed for me what I was already expecting, that The Game Kitchen was the perfect choice to bring the series that began in 2D back to its original format, while kicking it up to the levels that developers today have been achieving with 2D action games. I can't wait for the full release, which is coming in a little more than a month at the time of this writing.</p>
<h3>Yasuke: A Lost Descendant - Developed by Dallience Studios - Release Date: TBA - PC</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Yasuke-A-Lost-Descendent-Steam-Next-Fest-June-2025.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This recommendation is the only one that comes with a major technical caveat, which is the fact that it didn't exactly run as smooth as I would have hoped. That said, the high-octane action and extremely flashy combat and parkour on display in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446760/YASUKE_A_Lost_Descendant/">Yasuke: A Lost Descendant</a> shined through its performance issues.</p>
<p>If you're one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-10-million-units-almost-one-million-of-which-in-the-last-few-months/">10 million who bought Devil May Cry 5</a> and are looking for something new to fill that stylish action-sized hole, and don't mind adding a touch of 3D platforming into the mix, then Yasuke: A Lost Descendant should definitely be on your radar. Sure, the performance issues might get in the way of your enjoyment, but it's the game's alpha build, and this is Steam Next Fest. The understanding is the games we're playing are not the final, full-polished version. The gameplay and combat mechanics that are at the heart of Yasuke: A Lost Descendant are clearly very solid, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the full release can offer when it eventually does release.</p>
<h3>Metal Eden - Developed by Reikon Games - Release Date: Q3 2025 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Metal-Eden-Demo-Released.png"></a></figure>

<p>We've been following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/">Metal Eden</a> here at Wccftech since it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">first revealed earlier this year</a>, and at the time, we thought it would already be out by now, with a May 6, 2025 release date set. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-has-been-delayed-now-launching-sometime-in-summer-2025/">since been delayed</a>, with no new release date to look forward to, but after playing the demo I'm happy to let developer Reikon Games take as long as they need. Whenever it's ready, I'll be there.</p>
<p>Metal Eden's fast-paced, stylish shooting and fluid movements all feel amazing, and while the game's story could turn out to be a dud in the full release, at least with what I've seen so far in the demo, I'm very intrigued to find out more. It scratches a similar itch to the one Bloodthief and Ghostrunner scratched. I'm clearly a mark for a first-person action game that lets you wall run like its nobody's business.</p>
<h3>Morsels - Developed by Furcula - Release Date: 2025 - PC, Xbox Series X/S</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Morsels-Steam-Next-Fest-2025.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While I truly did love all the demos listed here in this latest edition of Steam Next Fest, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't have a favorite among the new games I played. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">Morsels</a> is that favorite, as it immediately hit me with a 1-2 punch of an art style that looked like it was out of a fever dream, and a soundtrack that I want to have in my music library yesterday.</p>
<p>If you don't play any other demos from Steam Next Fest in its closing weekend and only play Morsels, it will have been a Next Fest well spent. This creature-collecting rougelite is weird in all the best ways, with gameplay that feels fun to execute and a roguelite system that I can't wait to dive deeper into. I'm hopeful that this game does make its 2025 release window, only because I absolutely cannot wait to play the full game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers.1217961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation and business segment meeting</a>, the latest update on PlayStation Plus from Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer, Hideaki Nishino, confirmed that Sony will continue to adjust its pricing strategy around PlayStation Plus, as the company is seeing that players are "<em>increasingly choosing our Premium and Extra tiers</em>."</p>
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus has increased twice so far in this generation, with the first major increase happening in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852353/playstation-plus-prices-increase-essential-extra-premium">2023</a> and the next one just a couple of months ago in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">April 2025</a> (though the most recent increase applied only to major regions outside the US).</p>
<p>PS Plus is getting more expensive, and yet, despite the uproar around Sony increasing the price while also <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">seemingly giving players fewer first-party offerings</a> and the snail pace with which games are added to the Classics catalog of games available at the Premium tier, more players are choosing to pay for the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>
<p>"<em>We are focused on driving profitable growth by increasing engagement and appeal, and by continuously improving the service proposition and the content that we offer players and subscribers,</em>" Nishino said.</p>
<p>"<em>As a result, subscribers are increasingly choosing Premium and Extra tiers, which now represent approximately 38% of all subscribers.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a separate 'Fireside Chat' video that was released alongside the business segment presentation, Nishino was asked more directly about the PS Plus price increases, and how frequently he sees PlayStation being able to raise the price of the service.</p>
<p>"<em>PlayStation Plus is highly valued by our players and continues to drive engagement</em>," he began. "<em>We are already seeing a trend towards the option of higher tiers within our service, as evidenced by the subscriber mix we achieved in FY2024, where approximately 38% are now subscribed to PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra tier. This is even after the global price increases we implemented in FY2023, and more recently, the local price increases in selected countries to improve our pricing strategy across certain market clusters, and also to account for [foreign exchange] movements</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These price increases were partly a result of increasing value we bring to the players, through the quality and diversity of content we continue to add, as well as investment in features to improve the service further, such as player personalization and enhanced content discovery. The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value, and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability</em>."</p>
<p>Nishino isn't directly confirming that we should expect more price increases, but maximizing profitability for a product, while adding features to it, doesn't usually equal a price decrease for that product.</p>
<p>For how upset players seem to get about the price increases when they happen, the numbers show that, increasingly, there's more who don't care that the price is going up, and want to keep paying for at least the Extra tier to get access to the large catalog of games available at the higher levels of PS Plus.</p>
