			<p>Contrary to<a href="https://wccftech.com/insider-suggests-a-playstation-event-wont-happen-until-september-rumor/"> previous rumors</a>, Sony may not skip this year's "Not-E3" season, as a PlayStation State of Play is reportedly scheduled for June.</p>
<p>Speaking during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-BnQ9OIHOg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings</a>, the ever-reliable Jeff Grubb commented on the next PlayStation event, saying that, like Nate the Hate, he didn't hear anything about a May event, because there is one planned for June. The event, however, will probably not be a big one. The publisher has been going back and forth between showcase and PlayStation State of Play for a while, and has probably settled on a State of Play event for next month. Interestingly enough, Jeff Grubb highlighted how "abnormally difficult" it was to obtain this information, so there's definitely something going on behind the scenes at Sony.</p>

<p>It has been a while since Sony hosted big PlayStation showcases, so there's a solid chance that Jeff Grubb provided once again correct information. As for which games will be showcased during the next PlayStation State of Play event, no information has been provided, although it would be a safe bet to expect to see <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-controversial-kojima-mass-market/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/">Ghost of Yōtei </a>during the event. As the PlayStation 5 port of Starfield is supposedly getting revealed, and shortly after released, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">this year</a>, showing it during the event would make tons of sense, although this is mere speculation as the timing of the reveal is not yet known.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the most impressive-looking open-world RPGs ever released, thanks to mods such as the DreamPunk mod which elevates the game's visuals to new levels of realism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams">3.1.1 version</a> of the mod and the enhancements it brings to the game developed by CD Projekt Red are showcased in an 8K resolution video shared by the creator of the mod, NextGen Dreams, on YouTube. The new version of the mode redefines all the features seen in the previous versions at a small performance cost, introducing a new LUT designed to extend the lower dynamic range of the game, enhanced path tracing configuration, and more. The video also showcases the custom-made photo realistic camera shake shader, which looks great for gameplay showcases and free roaming.</p>

<p>With the development of Cyberpunk 2077 concluded, except for the development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>, which is launching next month together with the next-generation Nintendo system, CD Projekt Red is now entirely focused on the development of the second entry in the series, currently known as Project Orion. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/">Earlier this week</a>, the creator of the Cyberpunk universe revealed that the game will feature a second city to explore besides Night City, a city that was described as a sort of Chicago gone wrong, with a very different vibe than the city players have explored alongside V in the original game.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The game will launch on Nintendo Switch on June 5th.</p>
