			<p>The exodus of PlatinumGames' hugely talented developers continues, with Astral Chain director and designer on Nier Automata, <strong>Takahisa Taura</strong>, confirming that he has also left the studio, though not to follow Hideki Kamiya to Clovers. Instead, Taura founded Eel Game Studio with a few other founding members.</p>
<p>In an interview with Famitsu (transcribed by <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1917511865078538755?s=46">Genki</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/top-platinumgames-designer-quits-studio-starts-new-game-company/">VGC</a>), Taura confirmed his departure from Platinum and the founding of his new studio, but wouldn't say who the other founding members are. He also confirmed that despite beginning this new adventure, he'll still collaborate with Yoko Taro, Yosuke Saito, and Keiichi Okabe on an unannounced project.</p>
<p>All four were key members of Nier Automata, so this unannounced project could potentially be Nier-related, but it's still too early to tell.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya, former creative lead at PlatinumGames and one of the studio's founders, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/">left Platinum in 2023</a>, kicking up a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/">YouTube channel at first</a> while working to form another new studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Clovers</a>. Which, as fans of Kamiya's work immediately recognized, was a callback to a studio Kamiya previously founded, Clover.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/hideki-kamiya-on-returning-to-his-roots-with-clovers-and-okami-2/">VGC</a> last year, Kamiya confirmed that the developers who started Clovers with him were mainly former PlatinumGames members, and that he left Platinum mostly because he was unsatisfied there.</p>
<p>"<em>If I was satisfied at Platinum, then I wouldn't have left. If there was one thing I am worried about, it's the fact I was VP and chief game designer of PlatinumGames. And so with me quitting, I worry about the people there, the staff there. Of course, if they're motivated and happy at Platinum, I believe that's the right path for them. But if there are others whose mindset aligns more with what we're building here at Clovers, we want to welcome and provide a path for them, too. I see that as a responsibility I have to those people after leaving Platinum.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, Kamiya is speaking for himself, but his words raise questions about how things are internally at Platinum. Taura, like Kamiya, is another massive talent the studio is missing now.</p>
<p>This is not to say that PlatinumGames is without talented developers. It's just to point out that Platinum was a happy home for some of the best and most storied developers in the video game industry for years until it wasn't. It'll be interesting to see how the studio continues to evolve.</p>
<p>And regarding Taura and Eel Game Studio, hopefully it's not too long before we see what they're working on.</p>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 now available for download introduces noticeable visual improvements at the cost of a relatively minor performance impact.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the Enhanced Lumen mod available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/71?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a> is a modified engine configuration file that adds the r.Lumen.TraceMeshSDFs parameter, which helps achieve more accurate lighting and reflections calculations. Activating this parameter results in a performance loss of between 2 and 4 frames per second, but it can significantly enhance lighting in certain scenarios, as showcased in the comparison screenshots below.</p>

<p>Despite launching shortly after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">mother of all shadowdrops</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became quite successful in a few short days. Earlier this week, it was confirmed that the role-playing game developed by Sandfall Interactive has already sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">one million copies</a>, which is a fantastic result considering the game is also available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles. The game's success, which is entirely deserved, as it is among one of the best role-playing games released in recent times thanks to its excellent story, cast of characters, and gameplay, also means that we will see more of its world in some form, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-chances-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33-getting-dlc-are-good-hints-lead-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested by the game's lead writer</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

			<p>[<strong>Update</strong>] As suggested by the price adjustment for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S made by French retailer Micromania earlier today, the price of both current-generation systems is increasing worldwide.</p>
<p>The steepest increase, as reported by The Game Business, will be in the United States, as the Xbox Series X price is increasing by $100 to $599 and the Xbox Series S by $80 to $429.99. Microsoft has also confirmed that the prices of controllers and headsets are increasing, and that some games will cost $79.99 starting this holiday season. A full rundown of the price increases in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and Australia can be found <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/xbox-raises-prices-on-consoles-games">here</a>.</p>
<p>[<strong>Original Story</strong>] The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S may soon receive a price increase, judging from what a big European retailer did just as the new month began.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-s-and-x-get-overnight-price-increase-in-french-retailer-micromania.1178412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, French retailer Micromania has increased the price of both Microsoft's current-generation systems overnight. All the SKUs available from the retailer have seen a â‚¬50 price increase, and the timing suggests that this price adjustment could have been made ahead of an official announcement coming in the next few days.</p>
<p>The current economic situation worldwide is making it difficult for console manufacturers to maintain steady prices for their systems, so seeing an official price increase for the Xbox Series X wouldn't be surprising, however unfortunate it is.<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last month</a>, Sony increased the price of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand due to the challenging economic environment, high inflation, and fluctuating exchange rates.</span> The system's price has been unchanged in the United States to date.</p>
<p>If the economic situation continues to be as challenging as it is today, gaming will definitely get more and more expensive down the line. While it is not a real price increase like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 increases, the Nintendo Switch 2's launch price, which may <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">increase in the future</a>, was higher than most analysts predicted, suggesting that next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft will likely be priced much higher than most expect, though <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">handheld</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-once-again-teased-by-phil-spencer/">offerings</a> could mitigate this issue.</p>
