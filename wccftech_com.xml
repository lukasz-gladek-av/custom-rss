			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now supported in over 175 games, the GeForce company announced today at Gamescom 2025. The list is about to grow with the likes of Resident Evil Requiem (CAPCOM) and Directive 8020 (Supermassive Games), both due in 2026 with DLSS 4 support and full path tracing to maximize visuals and performance.</p>



<p>Several other games will include NVIDIA DLSS 4 and ray tracing:</p>



<ul>
<li>Black State (stealth action/adventure game from Turkish developer Motion Blur, which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-qa-and-exclusive-screens-making-the-best-looking-games-with-best-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> a while ago)</li>



<li>Cinder City (formerly known as Project LLL, an open world MMO shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-announces-project-lll-an-open-world-mmo-shooter-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by NCSoft in late 2022)</li>



<li>Cronos: The New Dawn (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sci-fi survival horror IP from Bloober Team</a>, out in a couple of weeks)</li>

<li>Honeycomb: The World Beyond (a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510440/Honeycomb_The_World_Beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sci-fi survival sandbox game</a> due in 2025)</li>



<li>Lost Soul Aside (the action game that started as a one-man project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due in around ten days</a>)</li>



<li>The Outer Worlds 2 (Obsidian's sci-fi RPG sequel, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled for October 28</a>)</li>



<li>Phantom Blade Zero (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-new-gameplay-s-party-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hotly anticipated action game from S-GAME</a> with no release window in sight)</li>



<li>PRAGMATA (CAPCOM's <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sci-fi action/adventure game</a>, due at some point in 2026)</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, Gearbox's Borderlands 4 and the free-to-play third-person anime-style hero-based shooter game Fate Trigger by Saroasis Studios will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, accelerating performance even further for GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>



<p>Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>DLSS 4 and path tracing are no longer cutting-edge graphical experiments — they’re the foundation of modern PC gaming titles. Developers are embracing AI-powered rendering to unlock stunning visuals and massive performance gains, enabling gamers everywhere to experience the future of real-time graphics today.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025 announcements</a>, NVIDIA confirmed that the long-awaited RTX Hair feature will debut in September in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>



<p>You might recall that it had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to arrive back in February alongside the NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. DLSS 4 MFG was indeed introduced with that update, but RTX Hair wasn't. Clearly, NVIDIA and MachineGames still had to iron out some kinks.</p>



<p>RTX Hair leverages linear swept spheres, a new hardware feature introduced with the GeForce RTX 50 Series of graphics cards. This new primitive renders hair with spheres instead of triangles as usual. NVIDIA says this is not only a better fit for the shape of hair but also reduces the amount of geometry needed to render each strand of hair. Additionally, RTX Hair reportedly offers better lighting and shadows while only occupying a small memory footprint. NVIDIA later clarified that in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, linear swept spheres will only be available to Blackwell GPUs, whereas any other GPU will have to stick with the existing hair model.</p>



<p>NVIDIA did not provide any detailed performance data on how RTX Hair will affect the frame rate in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, so we'll have to check that ourselves when the update goes live in a few weeks. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent first-person action/adventure game</a> will also soon get its story-based premium DLC, The Order of Giants, which was included with the Premium Edition and can be bought separately (with the Digital Premium Upgrade) for €35.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-state-of-play-coming-in-september-2025-it%E2%80%99s-claimed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1273143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has had a State of Play, or some kind of presentation in September every year for the last six years, and according to Jeff Grubb, who has proven to be a reliable source for information ahead of official announcements, they won't be breaking that streak in 2025 with a State of Play, "<em>maybe a Showcase</em>," planned for "<em>before the end of September</em>."</p>



<p>Grubb made his claim during Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, at the 20 minute and 10-second mark while Grubb and his guest, IGN's Seth Macy, were discussing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/">weekend scare that Fairgames from Haven Studios had been canned</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="45-Minute Kirby Air Riders Direct Announced" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KYP00kf4GM?start=1221&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've heard, - and this one I feel comfortable saying, you can go write headlines about this if you want</em> - <em>they're planning a State of Play, or maybe a Showcase, but probably a State of Play, for the end of September, or before the end of September. So we're gonna hear, we're going to get updates from Sony here pretty soon</em>,<em>" </em>Grubb said.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, we don't know what Sony has lined up for the remainder of 2025, and after Gamescom ONL tomorrow, September would be the perfect opening for Sony to let players know what they can look forward to for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>The last <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">State of Play this past June</a> included mostly news for third-party titles and 2026 releases. In the very likely scenario that a September 2025 State of Play is on the horizon, hopefully it includes more news about what's coming from PlayStation and Sony in the next few months.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/netease-has-marvel-go-ahead-to-make-original-marve-rivals-characters-director-says-stay-tuned/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-has-marvel%E2%80%99s-go-ahead-to-make-original-characters-for-marvel-rivals-game-director-says-to-%E2%80%9Cstay-tuned%E2%80%9D.1273065/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> has been one of the most popular games of 2025 so far, and has already introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-5-release-date-update/">several famous Marvel characters</a> to its roster, with more on the horizon. But if you were wondering if NetEase would ever go beyond the limits of the vast list of characters in the Marvel universe, that option seems significantly more likely after recent comments from the game's director, Guangguang.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals">MP1st</a>, when asked if making an original character was something NetEase was even allowed to do, Guangguang confirmed that NetEase does in fact have Marvel and Disney's approval to make an original character for the game. As to whether NetEase will take advantage of that free reign, Guangguang simply said to "<em>Stay tuned</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, we are allowed to introduce original characters in Marvel Rivals</em>," Guangguang said in response to the question of whether NetEase could even go that route.</p>



<p>Guangguang doesn't confirm or deny that they're looking to make an original character, but it's exciting for players and Marvel fans to know that the option is open to the studio. Though, as interesting as it would be to see NetEase create their own Marvel character, it's worth wondering if that is even worth the time and investment with a game like Marvel Rivals, that leans so heavily on NetEase taking well-known existing characters from the Marvel universe and putting their own artistic spin on their design and gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>NetEase puts its own stamp on the Marvel franchise with its sharp designs for each character. It doesn't necessarily need to go the extra step and create a wholly original character, but it's nice to know that the option is there for the team if they ever decide to use it. And who knows, there could be one waiting in the wings to be announced with the game's next major update.</p>



<p>As Guangguang said, we'll have to wait and see what NetEase does next.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CI Games says Lords of the Fallen 2 will be their “Empire Strikes Back” Moment, and a “Darker” Game Than the 2023 Reboot]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ci-games-says-lords-of-the-fallen-2-will-be-their-%E2%80%9Cempire-strikes-back%E2%80%9D-moment-and-a-%E2%80%9Cdarker%E2%80%9D-game-than-the-2023-reboot.1273032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The very first Lords of the Fallen release came in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265300/Lords_Of_The_Fallen_2014/">2014</a>, and while it was able to find an audience, it ultimately didn't make a huge splash. Despite a myriad of issues, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">2023 reboot</a> fared much better, so much that CI Games has already announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/">sequel in the works</a> for 2026. After spending a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">significant amount of time fixing the 2023 release</a>, the studio is confident that its sequel, titled Lords of the Fallen 2, will be the studio's "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/lords-of-the-fallen-2-ci-games-empire-strikes-back-sequel-darker-title">MP1st</a>, creative portfolio strategist at CI Games, David Valjalo, likened Lords of the Fallen 2 to the famed Star Wars sequel back when the original trilogy was all we knew, or for those who may not have grown up with Star Wars the way Valjalo's generation did, he instead likened it to the studio's Dark Knight moment, the famous sequel in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.</p>



<p>"<em>We're right on track and in the thick of it now</em>," Valjalo said. "<em>The sequel is looking spectacular. I have the privilege of seeing all the juicy behind the scenes bits and pieces - art, animation, combat, - and each day there's something that just stops me in my tracks. It's bloody, bold, brave...it's a true sequel. It improves on the previous game but carries its spirit forward. It's also a darker game, tonally, with a really unique setting and even higher stakes than the last game, if you can believe that. It's our Empire Strikes Back. Or for Gen Z I suppose it's their Dark Knight</em>."</p>



<p>Strong words from a studio that took two years to release an overhauled "<em>2.0</em>" version of their last game that launched with a bevy of issues, so many that our reviewer called it "<em>one of the most frustrating Souslikes ever released</em>." CI Games also recently permanently reduced the price of the 2023 title, and every game in its catalogue, as part of what it called its <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-permanent-price-cut-ci-games/">"<em>player first</em>" commitment</a> that also couldn't help but read like an apology for the fact that they released a product below their standards two-years prior.</p>



<p>If it does hit its 2026 target release window, then perhaps by 2028 it'll be the studio's 'Empire Strikes Back' for the series.</p>
