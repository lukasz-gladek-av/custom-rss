			<p>Last month, it was widely reported that a stapler ruined the Nintendo Switch 2 launch for some unlucky players who ordered a unit by a GameStop New York store. Now, you can own this involuntary piece of memorabilia and help a charity in the process.</p>



<p>On X, GameStop has confirmed that the infamous stapler used by an employee to staple a receipt directly to a customer's Nintendo Switch 2 box, puncturing both the box and the screen, has been put up for auction on eBay. The stapler comes with a certificae of authenticity and the first unit that has been damaged by it, complete with damaged packaging, although GameStop assured the system has been repaired and is in full working conditions. The stapler and the repaired system are currently going for almost $109,000, but the price is likely going to get higher by the time the auction ends next week. All proceeds will be going to the <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/#:~:text=Children's%20Miracle%20Network%20Hospitals%20raises,most%20urgent%20needs%20are%20met.">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals charity.</a></p>

<p>Though the Nintendo Switch 2 launch was marred by this incident for some unlucky players, the release of the next-generation Nintendo console was a smashing success, which is throughly deserved, as the new console is a considerable step up from its predecessor in every possible way.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to be remembered for a very long time as a great technical achievement, given what the console manages to achieve using so little power in both docked and handheld modes compared to other versions of the game.</p>



<p>In a new video comparing the Nintendo Switch 2 version and the PC version running on Steam Deck, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> also provided an in-depth look at how the graphics settings of the Switch 2 version compare to the different options available on PC. The comparison is favorable for the new generation Nintendo system, as many settings, like crowd density and volumetric fog, are closer to the medium settings, rather than the expected low settings, while others are closer to the high settings, like ambient occlusion and mirror quality in docked mode. Other settings are difficult to match on the PC version of the game due to the ample customization made for the Switch 2 version, but even then, there are many instances where the port impresses, such as with screen space reflections, which are close to the high PC setting in some scenarios, and distant shadow resolution, which are similarly closer to the high settings on PC in several istances.</p>



<p>Even comparing the Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 settings to those of the PlayStation 5 version, the port looks impressive, as some options are set higher on the Nintendo system, although that is easily explained by the fact that the Switch 2 version renders at a much lower resolution. In terms of what's been actually rendered, the Switch 2 version, on the other hand, is in the same ballpark as the PS5 version, and superior to the PS4 and PS4 Pro versions, which was expected given the much better CPU and storage of the new Nintendo system.  The comparison between the two systems, much like the comparison with the PC settings, is quite favorable to the Nintendo system, as it shows how CDPR did not have to deal with extreme cutbacks for the new version of their open-world RPG.</p>
