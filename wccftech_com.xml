			<p>A report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">The Wall Street Journal</a> reveals that EA is closing in on a deal to become a private company, with private equity investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the firm Silver Lake putting up a massive $50 billion to buy out the company. According to The WSJ, if this buyout were to go through, it would go down as the "<em>largest leveraged buyout ever.</em>"</p>



<p>Details on the deal are currently unclear, and of course, we don't necessarily know if it'll go through or not. Large-stakes deals involving Saudi Arabia and its growing interests in the videogame industry have <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/">gone under at the last minute for what remain unknown reasons</a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the first time that we've seen the idea of EA changing in ownership getting tossed around, as there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-gaming-giant-buy-ea-iger-noncommital/">reports of Disney potentially looking at acquiring EA in 2023</a>, though nothing ever came of the idea in part due to chief executive officer Bob Iger not wanting to invest so much in that direction. </p>



<p>Still, if this deal that the WSJ has reported goes through and EA becomes a private company, it could potentially mean a massive shift for one of the videogame industry's largest publishers and developers. Since the WSJ's report broke, EA's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/electronic-arts-buyout.html">stock has reportedly jumped up 15%</a>.</p>

			<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1ODkwNzA3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzU5NTExODcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMzdHSzZHUFFRVkswMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lidXNm4rmbqYYLqJZbYiy4XcuF9d7QqKMdctRoZmr7g">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which centers around one of the modern video game industry's issues: there are simply too many games. Schreier pointed out a staggering statistic to consider about how the industry has changed in the last few years, showing that according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a>, the amount of games released on Steam in 2020 totalled around 9,656. In 2024, that number went up 93%, to 18,626.</p>



<p>In today's attention economy, where video game developers aren't just competing with other developers to get players buying and playing their games but with streaming services, social media apps, and so on, it's hard enough for studios to sell copies in the first place. Add to that the fact that there are more games launching all the time, every day, with both big triple-A titles and small indie titles vying for attention, and the problem is further exacerbated.</p>



<p>To be clear, this isn't necessarily a problem for casual video game enjoyer-Joe Blow. It's arguably a better time than ever before to be someone who enjoys playing video games, simply because there is such a flux of good games to play, at a variety of price points, available on multiple devices and even on ones that don't need to be primed for playing games, thanks to better-than-ever cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>But it is a growing challenge for game developers who, particularly when you consider that games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-biggest-competitor-threat-video-games-industry/">Fortnite and other live-service forever-style games</a> are the biggest competition to anyone trying to just release a new, fully-formed game.</p>



<p>You won't see game studios cite the fact that there are 'too many games' as a reason for why their laying off staff or shutting down, but this is a new reality that the industry is having to grapple with now more than before.</p>



<p>It's not necessarily something that can be solved, nor should it really be considered a problem, so to speak. But it can't be denied that the growth of the video game industry in recent years means there's a new normal that game developers simply did not have to contend with at the same level a short five years ago.</p>

			<p>Heart Machine, the studio behind Hyper Light Breaker, Hyper Light Drifter, and Solar Ash, is getting ready to release its next game, Possessor(s), which it has announced will arrive on PC and PS5 on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Possessor(s) is a 2D search-action title where you play as Luca, but you also play as Rhem, the demon possessing Luca, as you both work together to escape the clutches of a company called Agradyne, who was using demons like Rhem to power the energy they sold to Sanzu City, the game's setting.</p>



<p>A gameplay overview trailer that debuted today alongside the release date news shows off the art and design chops Heart Machine is known for, while also delving into what Possessor(s) is about, and a bit more on how the high school-aged Luca and the demon Rhem ended up having to work together.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The launch of Possessor(s) will mark the second major release for Heart Machine in 2025 as it started the year with the early access launch of Hyper Light Breaker. Since then, the game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breakers-first-major-update-buried-below-arrives-next-week-game-key-giveaway/">received multiple updates</a>, the most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/497207097933433675?l=english">having arrived earlier this week</a>, as Heart Machine continues to fix and tweak the game in collaboration with its community.</p>



<p>Unlike Hyper Light Breaker, Possessor(s) is not releasing in early access, with the complete game set to launch in a little more than a month at the time of this writing.</p>
