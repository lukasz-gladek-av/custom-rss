			<p>A game that has been out since 2015 and has been released on many different platforms is only now seeing a cross-play option implemented next month. If you've been eagerly awaiting the day for Rainbow Six Siege to get PC and Console cross-play, you won't have to wait much longer. Support for cross-play on all platforms will launch in December with the latest update to be added, Rainbow Six Siege's Year 9 Season 4 update named Operation Collision Point. With this update, it means that players can now team up with their friends regardless of what platform they're playing on. However, if there is a PC player in the group, the team will always be put into the PC matchmaking pool.</p>
<p>While this is the first time Rainbow Six Siege is getting cross-play on all platforms, it isn't the first time the game had any sort of cross-play, as there was cross-play and cross-progression enabled for PC, Amazon Luna, and the Google Stadia version of the game in June 2021. However, Google Stadia fizzled out very quickly, and this brings us to the current day, where only PC and Amazon Luna had cross-play, or Xbox and PlayStation, which was added in late 2022.</p>
<p>While it has taken a <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">relatively long time</a>, this is something they've been actively working towards throughout the years that Rainbow Six Siege has been live. When cross-play for Xbox and PlayStation was released in late 2022, Ubisoft also added cross-progression across all platforms. Adding cross-play between PC and console is the final hurdle, so to speak. It has taken a relatively long time for them to get to this point, but it's because they've also been working to ensure that players are protected and cheaters are accurately punished if detected.</p>
<p>"Player Protection advances this season include Mousetrap Penalty adjustments to account for crossplay, automatic match cancellation if a cheater is detected, an overhaul for the Reputation center, and AI text moderation," says Chris Watters at Ubisoft. All of the information regarding<a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4luBBDMfipI6BDrwGGMV0L/rainbow-six-siege-operation-collision-point-operator-remaster-and-balancing-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Operation Collision Point</a> is available to read on the Ubisoft news page, which breaks down how they have balanced some of the Operators, as well as general improvements that are suited to the cross-platform experience.</p>
<p>To celebrate the news of the upcoming update, Ubisoft has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoHI1dehzI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-minute video</a> that provides information on how to utilize Blackbeard, as well as some starter tips for those who may be getting stuck into the game for the first time.</p>
