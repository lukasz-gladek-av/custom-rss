			<p>Microsoft has been on a mission to peddle its products with the slogan of "Xbox Anywhere." This includes being able to stream or play Xbox titles on their PCs, TVs, and even phones. Today, it's been announced by Xbox that there is a partnership with LG Electronics to bring the Xbox App to specific LG Smart TVs.</p>
<p>This means that those who have an LG Smart TV will gain access to the Xbox Gaming portal, where people will then get access to the Game Pass Ultimate catalog, allowing those interested to have access to top games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and the highly anticipated title, Avowed. To play the games, people will need to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and a compatible Bluetooth wireless controller to play games through the Xbox App. Additionally, those who are Xbox Game Pass members will also have the opportunity to play their own games. At the moment, there are only 50 games this applies to, with the list of games available on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire page</a>, where you can find out all of the info regarding streaming your games.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to announce the partnership with Xbox, which aims to enrich the gaming experience on LG Smart TVs with a broader selection of popular games. The Gaming Portal will provide users with a seamless, convenient, and exciting way to enhance the gaming experience on LG Smart TVs," says Chris Jo, the Senior Vice President of Platform Business at LG.</p>
<p>At the moment, the specific TVs haven't been specified by Xbox or LG, with the post created on Xbox Wire simply stating that the collaboration will go to their new LG Smart TVs "later this year."</p>
<p>This is all a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively new venture for Xbox</a>, as the ability to stream your own game on select platforms is also a trial that they are exploring and is an attempt to bring the Xbox Cloud Gaming Experience to the forefront, as they are slowly stepping away from focusing on console releases, and are trying to look at the bigger picture. However,<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-hardware-diminishing-returns/"> it has been confirmed by Phil Spencer</a> that they are continuing to explore new hardware and consoles that will be made in the future despite the difficulties in profit and cost.</p>
<p>Despite the troublesome time that Xbox has seemingly experienced as of late, <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-reckons-xbox-has-a-bright-future-according-to-sales-data/">according to Mat Piscatella</a>, Xbox is going to turn it around and will get to experience a bright future. A lot of this could boil down to the fact that they are no longer doing Xbox Exclusives, as they want to push the game onto as many platforms as possible.</p>
<p>Now it's just a waiting game to see how smooth the Xbox Cloud Gaming experience is on an LG Smart TV.</p>
