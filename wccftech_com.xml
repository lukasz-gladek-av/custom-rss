			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Epic</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-saw-record-setting-third-party-sales-growth-in-2025-reaches-317m-pc-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> year-in-review post</a>, revealing new records for sales of third-party games (<strong>+57% over last year</strong>), total PC users (<strong>over 317 million</strong>), and monthly active users (MAUs; <strong>78 million in December 2025</strong>, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the giveaway of Hogwarts Legacy</a> added around six million users). That said, while playtime spent with third-party games <strong>increased by 4%</strong>, total engagement across all Epic Games Store titles <strong>dropped by 14%</strong>, signaling a decrease in first-party engagement of games like <strong>Fortnite</strong> and <strong>Rocket League</strong>.</p>



<p>Website GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/were-not-going-to-topple-steam-epic-games-store-head-steve-allison-heralds-the-path-of-co-existence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to interview Epic Games Store General Manager Steve Allison</a>, who admitted that the goal is not (and perhaps never was) to topple <strong>Valve's Steam</strong> platform, which remains the market leader on PC:</p>



<p><em>Steam is a huge part of the PC ecosystem. It's not going away. We're not going to topple Steam.</em></p>



<p>During the interview, Allison <strong>acknowledged the criticism the store regularly gets from PC gamers when compared to Steam itself</strong>. He also revealed that Epic decided to completely remake the Epic Games Launcher in October 2025; the new version, which should finally let users see their libraries load almost instantly, is expected to be released in May or June.</p>



<p><em>We get so much criticism. I hate reading it, but I also appreciate it. It's not untrue. We were building incredibly rapidly on top of a foundation that was originally designed just to support Fortnite and Paragon, and we've continued to build on a house of cards. [The Launcher] is really slow. It's built on this old framework… and we've poked at it and optimized it, and I think we've done the best that we could with that. So we decided in October last year to rip the whole foundation down and rebuild it.</em></p>



<p>When it comes to the future growth of the Epic Games Store, Allison points <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the mobile versions that launched in August 2024</a>, but also reckons there's a lot of room for improvement on PC:</p>



<p><em>Mobile will be a big vector of growth, but like I said, I think we have room to get to a hundred million MAU on PC over the next four years, and I think we have a lot of room to get to 20–30% spend share. So you'll see us being pretty aggressive on our spend share on PC.</em></p>

			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version of <strong>Borderlands 4</strong> has been officially <strong>canceled</strong>. The news was shared yesterday, when <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> deleted the game from its updated list of upcoming releases found in its latest quarterly report. <strong>Alan Lewis</strong>, a spokesperson for Take-Two, shared the following statement <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>:</p>



<p><em>We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU. Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have ‘PGA Tour 2K25’ and ‘WWE 2K26’ coming out for Nintendo Switch 2, and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.</em></p>



<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to launch in October for Nintendo's new console</a>, just around a month after the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X launches, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was delayed in late September</a> with no further date in sight.</p>



<p>However, in May, <strong>Gearbox</strong> founder <strong>Randy Pitchford</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waxed praise on the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, <strong>calling it a perfect fit for Borderlands 4</strong>:</p>



<p><em>To have Nintendo Switch 2 in hand while we're making Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 is really exciting. Usually, we'll have to port a game to a platform, but in this case, we're making Borderlands 4 for the Nintendo Switch 2. And I think that when you play Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2, you'll realize that with the cooperative experience and how we can use the Nintendo Switch 2 platform to connect with friends, share our game with friends, it's pretty astonishing how perfect this platform is for Borderlands 4.</em></p>



<p><em>The Switch 2 has been a joy to work with. It's very powerful. It's an incredible machine in a very tight form factor, and we love being on the bleeding edge with our graphics and the experience that we're creating. And the Nintendo Switch 2 makes all that possible. We don't feel like we're fighting the system. We feel like the system is enabling us and empowering us to make the best version of Borderlands 4 we can. As a game developer, it's awesome.</em></p>



<p>Clearly, something went wrong between May and September. At this point, <strong>publisher Take-Two may have deemed the port not worth the effort</strong>. In other news from Take-Two's quarterly financial call, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/more-grand-theft-auto-vi-marketing-beats-coming-in-summer-2026-while-gta-v-has-sold-over-225m-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the publisher is preparing to launch the marketing campaign for Grand Theft Auto VI starting this Summer</a></strong>.</p>
