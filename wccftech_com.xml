			<p>EA's reboot of the Star Wars Battlefront series was a roller coaster of a journey, to say the least. The 2015 game was liked but blasted for a lack of content, an offline mode, and no campaign.</p>
<p>Then the 2017 sequel was, by all accounts, a noted improvement gameplay-wise, but the microtransactions that EA stuffed into it practically killed the game, driving players away at launch. EA supported the game for another three years and was able to turn the ship around with the removal of its awful microtransactions, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-visuals-improvements/">consistent updates</a> to improve the game, culminating in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-celebration-edition-leaks/">Celebration Edition</a> of the game that gave players access to every piece of content that was previously paywalled.</p>
<p>But neither the reboot nor the original series ever made it to a third entry. Star Wars Battlefront III has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-iii-pitched/">pitched</a> and even worked on, in the case of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-star-wars-battlefront-3-free-radical">original PS2-era series,</a> but never made it to fruition.</p>
<p>Hope rises for Battlefront III once again after a recent surge in popularity in Battlefront II, and (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/star-wars-battlefront-2-devs-want-to-get-the-band-back-together-to-make-battlefront-3/">VGC</a>), developers who worked on Battlefront II want to "<em>get the gang back together</em>" to make Battlefront III.</p>
<p>Responding to a comment on<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtsa5xq/?context=3"> Reddit</a> about a previous comment he had made that Battelfront II developers want to see the series get a third entry, Mats Helge Holm, who worked as a producer on Battelfront II, said, "<em>Me,</em> <em>having heard around my group of ex-colleagues, we want to get the gang back together.</em>"</p>
<p>Holm isn't the only one who has worked on Star Wars making the call for Battlefront III. Andor actor Muhannad Ben Amor also called for Battlefront III on<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes"> Instagram</a>, admitting he's a massive Battlefront fan, having logged 469 hours in Battlefront II.</p>
<p>Even with this new surge in popularity, players shouldn't be expecting EA to green-light a new Battlefront game anytime soon. In the thread where Holm comments that he and other former members of the Battlefront II team would like to work together again on Battlefront III, he says, "<em>I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally. But overall, yeah, I think there are people who are talking about it</em>."</p>
<p>If you enjoyed Battlefront II, it's worth hopping back in to enjoy the rush of players filling up matches. But keep your expectations in check regarding the chances of a third game ever happening.</p>

			<p>A Gears of War: Reloaded beta could be announced soon, judging from what has been recently discovered.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ktfpwe/gears_of_war_reloaded_beta_to_be_announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the unannounced beta was added to the Steam backend yesterday, as seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3749450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB</a>, so it's likely that it will be officially confirmed soon. Unfortunately, there is no information on when the beta could take place or what it will offer.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded will mark the PlayStation debut of one of the series that has long been synonymous with the Xbox brand. Announced<a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/"> earlier this month</a>, the game is a remaster of the first entry in the series developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, featuring all the content released for the original, as well as that included in the Ultimate Edition, such as the single-player campaign, all post-launch DLC, and every multiplayer map and play mode. The remaster will also enhance the experience with 4K resolution support on all platforms, 60 FPS gameplay in the campaign and 120 FPS in multiplayer, HDR and VRR support, visual improvements, and cross-platform progression and multiplayer.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded launches on August 25th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Those who purchased the Ultimate Edition before the remaster's announcement on May 5th will get the remaster via a free upgrade.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch lineup mainly consists of existing games ported to the new console, with very few exceptions, and one of them is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-will-run-at-4k60-with-hdr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST FUSION</a>.</p>
<p>The anti-gravity racing game series made by Munich-based developer Shin'en Multimedia is exclusive to Nintendo consoles. The first installment, FAST RACING LEAGUE, debuted on the Wii in May 2011. FAST RACING NEO then launched on the Wii U in 2015, and an enhanced version of that game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fast-rmx-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST RMX</a> debuted as a launch title for the Switch in March 2017.</p>
<p>FAST FUSION is also a launch title. However, this time around, it's a brand new installment with new features like Hyperjumps and Vehicle Fusion. As usual, it'll also be a technical showcase, and the studio has already shared that it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with High Dynamic Range support. Jack Merluzzi, the announcer known for his work on F-Zero GX, is returning from FAST RACING NEO.</p>
<p>We sent Shin'en Multimedia a few questions to learn more about their new game and discuss their experience with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p><em><strong>When did you start working on your Nintendo Switch 2 game?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We have been working since 2024 on the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Wow, that's not long at all. Were you really able to make FAST FUSION in just one year, or was it in development before?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The game wasn't in development before, but as we work on our own tools and engine and had done several FAST games before, we were able to speed up development a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>After some time with the new hardware, what was the most impressive&nbsp;new feature for you and why?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The new GPU features are, of course, most interesting to us from a developer's perspective. Having an HDR compatible display now makes quite a big difference in our game's look.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the Joy-Con 2 improvements? How are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the new HD rumble is very impressive. We use it in many places in FAST FUSION and it intensifies the action quite a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What are the main improvements that players will notice in FAST FUSION over the previous installment?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>First of all, players will of course notice the much more detailed, alive and vibrant tracks, but the new core elements like Vehicle Fusion and Hyperjumps are what take Fast Fusion to the next level.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How will the Vehicle Fusion feature work?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>You can use any vehicles you acquired in the game for Fusion (just by playing, we have no microtransactions). With Vehicle Fusion, you bring together two vehicles of your liking to create a hybrid of both. So you can, for instance, fuse a fast vehicle with low acceleration with a heavy vehicle that has fast acceleration. The new vehicle will combine the best of both worlds. Also, the looks of both vehicles will be merged into a totally new one.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Very interesting. Can't wait to try it. Thank you for your time!</strong></em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025 globally. Nintendo won't be providing pre-release review units and codes to the press, but look forward to our reviews of the new hardware and some of the launch games later in June.</p>
