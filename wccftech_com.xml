			<p>CD Projekt RED wasn't actually done with Cyberpunk 2077. The studio has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/514069779412157218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new update, version 2.2, which is focused on expanding customization in a number of ways.&nbsp;To start, there are over a hundred new options for protagonist V to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>32 eye colors</li>
<li>18 lip makeup types</li>
<li>17 nail colors</li>
<li>10 cheek makeup types</li>
<li>16 eye makeup types</li>
<li>4 face scars</li>
<li>5 eyebrow shapes</li>
<li>4 face tattoos</li>
<li>2 body tattoos</li>
<li>8 cosmetic face cyberware options</li>
</ul>
<p>The Character Creator randomizer features a new Plain-to-Punk slider, too. Of course, you'll likely want to share all those new customizations with friends, and what better way to do so than leveraging the expanded Cyberpunk 2077 Photo Mode? The following options have been added and/or enhanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.<br>
Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) - determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) - locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) - slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Car customization was also augmented with the addition of CrystalCoat technology to several vehicle brands. CrystalCoat lets you change the car's paint job on the fly, allowing players to fool NCPD and reduce their wanted level.</p>

<p>There are also some PC-specific improvements that improve Cyberpunk 2077 CPU performance on Intel Arrow Lake processors, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-cyberpunk-2077-patch-improves-intel-arrow-lake-cpu-performance-up-to-33-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> in our previous article. Lastly, CD Projekt RED teasingly added that Night City now hosts more secrets for players to discover. These are likely to be Easter eggs rather than full-fledged missions, mind.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the milestone of 30 million units sold. A sequel codenamed Project Orion <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in development</a> at the newly opened North American studio, although the main focus of the company as a whole is The Witcher 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now in full production</a>.</p>
