<p>Some of the new features that will come with Rainbow 6 Siege X this June include a new play mode called Dual Front, a permanent 6v6 game mode that will be set in the game's biggest map to date. In this mode, players will be able to form squads by picking between 35 different operators and proceed to secure enemy sectors while defending their own. While this new play mode will only be available when Rainbow 6 Siege X launches, players will be able to test it out this week with a limited-time closed beta that will run from March 13th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET to March 19th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET. To get access to the beta, players will need to connect their Twitch and Ubisoft Connect accounts and watch either the Showcase on the<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Official Rainbow 6 Twitch channel</a> or other <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">livestreams</a>.</p>
