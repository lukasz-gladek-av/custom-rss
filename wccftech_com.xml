			<p><a href="https://www.moddb.com/downloads/maxpayne2remixmod-by-darko913">A new Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod</a> introduces path tracing to a few early locations, offering stunning visuals. However, even on high-end GPUs like the RTX 5080, this lighting technology proves to be a true performance killer without proper optimization.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the modded version with path tracing and the vanilla version of the second entry in the series running side by side at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how some locations look stunning with path tracing. </p>



<p>At the same time, the comparison video clearly shows how path tracing is extremely taxing on current gaming hardware: with performance dropping from 1,255 FPS in the vanilla game to just 38 FPS in the mod in some instances, an RTX 5080 with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode takes a hit of over 1,200 FPS, representing an astonishing 97% performance drop overall. It's only with Frame Generation that the modded game reaches playable framerates above 60 FPS.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-path-tracing-requires-optimization-to-be-viable">Path Tracing Requires Optimization to Be Viable</h2>



<p>The massive performance hit seen in the Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod is far from being an uncommon occurrence, as almost every classic game that has received a path tracing overhaul sees similar performance drops. Among them is the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-rtx-remix-annihaltes-performance-4080/">original Max Payne</a>, which also sees performance drops in the 1000 FPS range on high-end GPUs, the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">Half-Life remake Black Mesa</a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">Left 4 Dead 2</a>. </p>



<p>This makes it even clearer how the demanding tech requires optimization work in conjunction with upscaling (and sometimes Frame Generation) to deliver acceptable performance, as demonstrated by some of the best implementations of the tech in recent years, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-continues-impressive-showcase/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rtx-remix-remasters-may-continue-to-be-the-best-option-to-update-classic-games-in-the-future">RTX Remix Remasters May Continue to Be The Best Option to Update Classic Games in the Future</h2>



<p>Although the current RTX Remix mods generally require very powerful hardware to run at playable framerates, these overhauls are likely to continue offering the best remaster option for games that won't receive official updates implementing the latest graphics tech. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Among these is&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto 4,</a>&nbsp;whose eventual remaster is unlikely to receive path tracing support,</span> based on<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"> the remasters released so far by Rockstar Games</a><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">.</span></p>



<p>Hopefully, gaming hardware will eventually catch up to make these unofficial remasters playable by the majority of players, even those without access to top-end hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, developer NCSOFT has talked about the game as part of its wider lineup (<a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-launch-globally-second-half-2026-monetization-less-aggressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aion 2</a>, Time Takers, Cinder City, Limit Zero Breakers) in a dedicated session at G-Star 2025, <a href="https://m.ruliweb.com/news/read/217907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as reported by Ruliweb</a>.</p>



<p>During development, Horizon Steel Frontiers was known as Project Skyline, and apparently, it was believed that it would employ 'AI NPCs'. When asked that question, though, NCSOFT focused instead on the fact that AI is being used 'extensively' in the game's production, and that they expect it to be used even more in future games.   </p>



<p><em>We're testing and receiving assistance internally through collaborations with basic NPCs and combat. Since we're an action RPG, we don't play with a large number of players, but rather determine the optimal number of players, and we receive assistance in various aspects. Internally, we also rely on AI for production, from coding to art. It 's being widely adopted in the field, and I think the technologies will gradually become known. The Horizon Steel Frontiers development team is also the one most eager to utilize AI. It's being used a lot, and you'll see that games coming out after Aion 2 will greatly increase their use of AI.</em></p>



<p>In the Q&amp;A published by Ruliweb, NCSOFT adds that the focus will be on PvE cooperation, although Guerrilla had mentioned some sort of competition with other tribes in the announcement video. When it comes to the release window, the Korean studio reiterated the release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported from the NCSOFT quarterly earnings call</a>: late 2026 or early 2027, with public testing scheduled to take place at some point next year.</p>



<p>In case MMORPGs are not your cup of tea and the announcement of Horizon Steel Frontiers did nothing for you, Guerrilla Games is still making <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own cooperative multiplayer version of the franchise</a>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-guerilla-has-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed once again</a> by Jason Schreier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The open world action/adventure game Immortals Fenyx Rising is now free to grab <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/immortals-fenyx-rising/5cec210a39798c0870c07684.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Ubisoft Connect</a> (PC) until December 2. The offer is Ubisoft's way to celebrate the fifth anniversary of its own ecosystem.</p>



<p>Immortals Fenyx Rising was developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the same team that led development of Assassin's Creed Odyssey and most recently launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The game debuted in December 2020 to a generally favorable reception. On Wccftech, it earned an 8 out of 10 score from Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-breath-titan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote at the time</a>:</p>



<p><em>At the end of the day, I enjoyed Immortals Fenix Rising way more than I thought I would. The first impressions were pretty bad, but as the game progressed and more options became available, I found myself fully engrossed in the tale of Fenyx and his war against the terrible Typhon, smiling at the jokes told by Prometheus and Zeus, and loving every second of gliding around the Golden Isle in search of treasure. Sure, the game is not innovative at all, but the way every little element and mechanic comes together makes it easy to look past this issue and enjoy one of the best open-world games put out by Ubisoft in recent years.</em></p>



<p>As usual in these cases, Ubisoft is actually gifting you the Standard Edition. However, it also happens that the DLCs are currently heavily discounted (-65%). You can pick <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-a-new-god-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A New God</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-the-lost-gods-review-ash-rising-from-the-fenyx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lost Gods</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-myths-of-the-eastern-realm-some-stories-are-better-left-untold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Myths of the Eastern Realm</a> for $2.80 each, or just grab the Season Pass at $7.00 to get access to all the DLCs.</p>



<p>In July 2022, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-will-be-based-on-hawaiian-polynesian-culture-game-is-still-in-early-pre-production-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surfaced</a> that an Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel was in early pre-production at Ubisoft Quebec and would center around Hawaiian Polynesian Culture. However, in July 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-to-prioritize-assassins-creed-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to cancel the project</a>, ensuring the team would focus entirely on Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In other Ubisoft news, the publisher has unexpectedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> its quarterly and half-year financial results, sparking speculation that an acquisition (possibly by Tencent) may be announced imminently.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/asus-says-market-response-to-xbox-rog-ally-has-been-extremely-positive/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Like many other companies this week, Taiwanese computer, electronics, and phone manufacturer ASUS posted its quarterly reports, and Chief Financial Officer Nick Wu spoke about the new ROG Ally products, released last month in partnership with Xbox. During the Q3 2025 investor call, Wu claimed the market response has been highly positive, and demand for these pricier devices has surprised even ASUS.</p>



<p><em>As many of you know, we introduced the first-generation ROG Ally 2-3 years ago as a market pioneer. Over the past couple of years, this new category, especially within the Windows ecosystem and creating this particular new category, has proven itself to be highly successful. We believe that we have achieved our original goals in terms of premium positioning and creating a new growth driver in the gaming segment. That is why we launched the 3rd-generation ROG Ally last month. It featured deeper collaboration with Xbox. Since its launch, we see that the market response for it has been extremely positive. Particularly, there has been an appetite for the premium higher-end models exceeding our expectations. In fact, these high-end variants are currently in short supply.</em> <em>We are working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that currently exists. Our goal for the ROG Ally is to remain a core pillar within the ASUS gaming portfolio, while also driving tangible revenue and profit growth for the company.</em></p>



<p>The CFO went on to say that the company estimates a revenue contribution from these launches to be between 3 and 5 billion New Taiwan dollars (NT$), which translates to between $96 million and $160 million. The robust demand leads ASUS to believe that this could increase slightly in future quarters to a range of between 4 and 5 billion NT$ (128-160 million US dollars).</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our review of the ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, David Carcasole praised its advanced hardware capabilities but also criticized the price tag, wondering if there was even an audience for it. Apparently, so far, it's more than enough as far as ASUS is concerned.</p>

						<h5>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h5><p><span>November 14th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Treyarch, Raven Software</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite being the seventh title in the Black Ops franchise, this year's title, co-developed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/treyarch-call-of-duty-black-ops-3-presents-our-most-ambitious-campaign-yet/">Treyarch</a> and Raven Software, sidesteps last year's title and is instead billed as a direct follow-up to a title that launched back on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 centers around the return of the antagonist of that story, Raul Menendez, back once again and threatening to burn the whole world down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With Raul Menendez, the overarching antagonist of the second Black Ops title, seemingly back from the dead, a new security contractor/paramilitary force known as The Guild has risen up to protect the world against this terrorist. Even though Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is linked directly with the second title, players get a crash course on the events of a game that was released more than a dozen years ago, yet still futuristic in its timeline (the second Black Ops title was set in 2025, while Black Ops 7 takes place ten years later in 2035). Even if you have never played a Call of Duty title before and know nothing about the task force and various characters, the game's flashy set pieces and nonstop action will draw most players in.</p>



<p>While Menendez is the face of Black Ops 7's campaign early on, this spectre of a bygone era is little more than a boogeyman than an actual threat. No, it should come as no surprise that this up-and-coming security force known as The Guild is the real threat this time around. Led by a millennial woman who channels her inner Elizabeth Holmes in public, this faction is one of Call of Duty's least effective villains. Their main driving force is in the creation and testing of an experimental psychoactive drug that makes the victim hallucinate or lash out in rage. It's a somewhat low-tech solution for a paramilitary company that bills itself as a leader in robotics and AI.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In an era of deepfakes, bringing Raul Menendez back from the dead to make a public threat does little to push the narrative forward beyond digging up painful memories for the lead character and his crew. At no point did Menendez feel like a credible threat during the campaign beyond the collective psychotrips that Mason and his crew endure on a regular basis. I daresay that beyond all of The Guild's scheming and desire to build and test a new chemical weapon, this is overall one of the lowest-stakes campaigns to come around to Call of Duty in a while. The Guild rarely feels as powerful and imposing as its figurehead Kagan would lead the public to believe, even with their technology and fancy toys, and the eleven chapters of the co-op campaign lead up to a rather weak confrontation on the battlefield.</p>



<p>Early on in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's co-op campaign, Mason and his crew are subjected to the psychoactive substance that The Guild has been cooking up, and due to the convenient plot device of having the team share a neural link, they can all go on a collective trip into the deep reaches of each protagonist's repressed trauma. For Mason, it's revisiting Nicaragua to chase down Menendez while massive machetes rain from the sky. For others, it's breaking out of a Russian prison or revisiting 2025 Los Angeles in the midst of a terrorist attack. These set pieces offer something dynamically different from the rest of the narrative, removing the grounded sci-fi military narrative with metaphysical threats and horrors twisted to that character's state of mind. With how the narrative keeps jumping between chasing down Kagan and The Guild in the real world and another psychoactive trip in the next chapter, it can be difficult to keep track of what's going on without the whiplash of jumping between one narrative and the next. Throw in a single mission set in Japan with a different military faction, and you've got one messy timeline to follow along (if nothing else, this mission helps to justify the return of fan favorite multiplayer maps like Raid and Express with a Japanese makeover). </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following up from Black Ops 2 is a tough order for Treyarch and the numerous development studios that worked together to release Black Ops 7 just one year after the sixth numbered sequel. Black Ops 2 introduced significant innovation to the campaign's narrative and flow, most notably through branching storylines and Strike Force missions. Both of these are omitted from Black Ops 7's co-op campaign, instead focused on a rollercoaster that takes players from the televised return of Raul Menendez to the fall of The Guild and lingering around Avalon to clean up the remains in the separate Endgame mode. Instead, the real innovations to the campaign storytelling this time around come by way of the ability to play through the entire shooting gallery campaign with three other friends and a progression track that feeds into the overall leveling up and unlocks for the other two core multiplayer modes. A lack of proper drop-in-and-drop-out matchmaking missed the opportunity to jump into a game with friends during the review period, unless we coordinated to try and meet up before queueing for a specific mission.</p>



<p>From beginning to Endgame (counting a single successful extraction), players are looking at around six to seven hours for the co-op campaign and not much reason to play the first eleven missions unless you missed a collectible (thankfully just one per mission) or the occasional achievement in certain chapters for pulling off an exemplary task. The few campaign missions that take place in Avalon during the latter half of the campaign lacked the sense of urgency and direction that the rest of the chapters had, instead feeling more like a brief tease for the open world map for the final chapter. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Endgame is indeed something unique for the Call of Duty campaigns, but might not feel too distinctly different from some of the other multiplayer offerings beyond the core multiplayer and zombies in earlier entries, namely Black Ops 4's Blackout and the likes of DMZ and MWZ. Players group up in squads of up to four and venture out to level up their chosen operator by completing repeatable missions all across the map of Avalon. As players level up, they'll pick up three different skill tracks out of a possible six, with each level providing a random boon to either their core stats or a skill unique to one of those three tech trees. Not all of these skill trees are created equal, as I found myself gravitating towards the Gunner track for faster reloads and Bulldozer for its immunity to self-inflicted explosions at the highest tier (a launcher was almost always part of my core loadout for Endgame).</p>



<p>Avalon is home to a variety of activities scattered throughout the map, but there isn't a sense of randomness to events across the map. For the most part, the majority of events are available on the map for players to pick off in any order they choose. With Endgame being exclusively a PvE mode, there isn't the excitement of running across an enemy squad like there was back in the days of DMZ. Instead, encounters feel almost like busy work as you replay them for the dozenth time because your operator died in the last match and you're having to start back up from zero. In just a few hours' time, I had a pretty good rotation of events to work with and quickly get my level up to where I could venture into at least the second-tiered zone early on and pick up a higher rarity weapon. Even as rival squads can lay claim to an activity on the map, let enough time pass, and players can come back to do it all over again for more loot and power XP.</p>

<p>Unlike MWZ, there aren't interesting pieces of loot like weapon blueprints or hidden quests to be discovered. Forget scavenging around foot lockers or duffel bags for unique drops. All of the gear that players will come across is either part of their loadout when they spawn into the match or acquired through quest rewards and supply drops. Because of how the weapon attachment system works for Endgame, it's often best to bring in a weapon that you've been leveling up in the core modes, complete with attachments and all, then use the various upgrade machines in each tier to boost the rarity of the weapon and its damage output. What attachments come on a field acquisition weapon is dictated by its initial rarity: base green tier (uncommon) weapons are limited to two, rare weapons three, epic four, and legendary weapons have five attachment slots. </p>



<p>There were also unique weapons that could be uncovered. Still, because I had barely scraped the surface of the highest difficulty tier in Endgame, I'm leaving that out of the campaign review. Instead, I will include it in our separate multiplayer review, which will be published soon. I've already had a sneak peek at what's to come in the first major content drop for Endgame, including some massive dinosaurs and bosses that are far more interesting than the basic Guild grunts and zombies littered around Avalon.</p>



<p>The strengths of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ready-for-launch-progression-prestige">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s campaign rally around three pillars new for this year's entry: playing with friends, shared progression, and integrating the open-world mode into the campaign. The first two are features that I hope remain a constant in Call of Duty moving forward, but it's tough to recommend Endgame as the main reason to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when previous modes like DMZ and Blackout offered a far more interesting set of challenges. These inclusions alone help bolster a campaign that otherwise felt like one of the lowest stakes a Call of Duty task force had ever had to shoot their way through. Whether you're here to see the continuation of Alex Mason's story from a decade ago or are just here for more of Michael Rooker's one-liners, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 shines through when you experience it with friends.</p>



<p><em>[Editor's Note: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was reviewed on the PlayStation 5 Pro. Review code and advance access to Endgame was provided by the publisher, but was also accessible after completing the campaign prior to publication.]</em></p>

						<section>
				<p>Being able to play through Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's campaign in a full squad of four and then jump straight into the Endgame makes this one of the more enjoyable Call of Duty campaigns in recent years, even if the story being told fails to live up to the hype.</p>
