			<p>Near the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_M3QwLBrg8g?si=gp3gx-tYiLO9bE5v&amp;t=5747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase 2025 stream</a>, and just before passing the baton to the Obsidian Direct dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-features-much-greater-reactivity-and-third-person-view-says-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> and Grounded 2, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer made an appearance to comment on the first-party lineup that fans will get next year. He not only confirmed a new Forza game for 2026 but also seemed to tease something Halo-related. Here's the exact quote:</p>
<p><em>Looking ahead, next year marks 25 years of Xbox. It's a big milestone for the platform and franchises that you helped build and make popular. We couldn't have done this without everyone who's been with us on this journey. As we think about bringing a new generation of players to these iconic franchises, I'm excited to share that players will get to celebrate 25 years of Xbox with a new Fable, the next Forza, Gears of War: E-Day, and the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War: E-Day</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a> were known quantities, of course. As for the new Forza game, we don't know yet for sure whether it is a new installment in the mainline simulation series developed by Turn 10 or a new Forza Horizon open world game. Logic would suggest the latter, as Forza Horizon 5 launched in 2021, whereas the latest Forza Motorsport was released in 2023.</p>
<p>Xbox fans are most excited about Spencer's final tease, though. Most of them think he's referring to a Halo game, since that was the flagship game when the original Xbox debuted in 2001. It could be a remaster or remake of the first game, Halo: Combat Evolved. Of course, there's also a chance it's something else entirely. Another option could be the return of Project Gotham Racing, which was the other major Xbox exclusive when Microsoft's first console debuted on the market. At the same time, it's unlikely Spencer would be boasting so much about another racing game when already announced that a new Forza is arriving in 2026.</p>
<p>We may know more before the end of the year. Meanwhile, we'll make sure to report on any rumors or leaks on the subject.</p>

			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Korean developer EVR Studio unveiled MUDANG: Two Hearts, an intriguing Metal Gear Solid-like game with a key premise: what if North and South Korea reunited as a single country? And what if, on the day the bill was supposed to be signed, a terrorist group attacked the South Korean National Assembly?</p>
<p>In MUDANG, players control two protagonists from contrasting backgrounds: Ji Jeongtae, an elite North Korean special forces operative fighting through enemy lines to uncover the truth; and GAVI, a K-pop idol under constant surveillance who plays a pivotal role in exposing a dangerous conspiracy. These opposing perspectives provide different gameplay experiences and narrative arcs that ultimately converge on a single, disturbing truth.</p>
<p>The game supports open-ended level design, allowing players a high degree of freedom when it comes to choosing their path throughout the missions. No matter what approach you take, the game offers a wealth of options, such as environmental takedowns; a wide range of close-quarters combat (CQC) moves, both lethal and non-lethal; a robust toolkit of gadgets, such as goggles, EMPs, grenades, lures, and mines; and a deep arsenal of firearms.</p>
<p><iframe title="MUDANG: Two Hearts | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6-5vM_tSVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>EVR Studio also claims that the enemy AI will be particularly challenging. It was designed to be versatile, dynamically adapting to the player's actions in real time. When the player character is hidden, the enemy forms search parties to investigate suspicious signs, such as fallen allies, disabled lights, or nearby footsteps, and raises the alarm when something is amiss. During combat, they work together to flank and outmaneuver the player.</p>
<p>MUDANG: Two Hearts will also feature seamless, immersive cutscenes, a narrative that responds to the player's choices, and formidable bosses that will test the player's combat skills to the limit. The game will launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>During the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Polish developer Bloober Team (Silent Hill 2 Remake, Layers of Fear, Layers of Fear 2, The Medium, Observer) announced a release window for Cronos: The New Dawn. The new sci-fi IP will debut at some point in the upcoming Fall season on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/concept/10011556" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p7tflq7ctxn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is already available on all platforms.</p>
<p>Of course, alongside the news, Bloober also presented a new Cronos: The New Dawn trailer, offering a closer look at the terrifying Orphans and revealing intense survival moments inside their nest. The Orphans are twisted monstrosities born from humanity's darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior (they are exceptionally aggressive and relentless), which turns every encounter with them into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent the Orphans from merging. In Cronos: The New Dawn, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. Otherwise, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy.</p>
<p>The new trailer also recounts part of the story of a mysterious predecessor, a traveller ND 3500,&nbsp; and their cryptic travel log. In this game, players will journey through unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by the Polish district of Nowa Huta, where decaying Brutalist architecture is warped and twisted by reality-bending anomalies.</p>

<p>Previously, Bloober Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clarified</a> that the game's combat was inspired by survival horror classics such as Resident Evil and Dead Space. The developers have also been loosely <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-deep-dive-from-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by FromSoftware's Dark Souls to make a more challenging game. When it comes to the setting, they were influenced by other media, like the movies 12 Monkeys and The Thing and the TV series Dark.</p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. The official PC system requirements have already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> and don't seem too onerous on paper.</p>
