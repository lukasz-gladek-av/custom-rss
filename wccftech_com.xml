			<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection was <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">first announced this past July</a>, with a release window set for 2026. Today, during the hour-long <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">Nintendo Direct</a> presentation, Capcom confirmed that the latest entry in the Monster Hunter Stories series will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this coming March 13, 2026.</p>



<p>A new trailer showcased today delved more into the game's story and showed off some more gameplay for the upcoming title.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3's narrative is kicked off with the birth of Twin Ratholos' with players stepping into the role of the heir to Azuria. "<em>Ride, befriend, raise, and battle with monsters in a vibrant and expansive world filled with a colorful cast of characters</em>," reads the video's description for the trailer. </p>



<p>The game will focus on the divide between two nations, with the birth of the two Ratholos' bringing both a sense of hope and terror, as they could either be part of the solution to the nations not destroying each other, or be the key to that dreaded destruction.</p>



<p>The last Monster Hunter Stories title surpassed <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240619.html">2 million units sold</a> as of June 2024, and this follow-up will surely be another strong seller in Capcom's portfolio of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">Monster Hunter games</a> that have been selling like gangbusters. </p>
