			<p>Strauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of Take-Two Interactive, is once again doing his best to project confidence that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be delayed from its current release date.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC5BVh0IaOg&amp;t=269s">CNBC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a>), on the subject of Grand Theft Auto VI hitting its currently stated release date, Zelnick said, "<em>My level of conviction is very, very high, obviously.</em> <em>Rockstar does have a lot of other things going on, but this is of course the primary focus</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Prior to Grand Theft Auto VI getting delayed out of 2025 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar announcing its May 26, 2026 release date</a>, Zelnick did his best on multiple occasions to publicly express confidence in Rockstar hitting its <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-march-2025/">2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. To be fair, there was no specific release date at the time, just a month and a year, meaning that Rockstar could be a little more loose with when exactly GTA VI would arrive. And this game is such a major release that you'd think Rockstar and Take-Two wouldn't call their shot so specifically if they weren't confident they would make it.</p>



<p>But the number of times Zelnick seemed to have a "<em>very high"</em> level of conviction that GTA VI wouldn't miss its 2025 window does make comments like this that much more difficult to believe. </p>



<p>Sure, it's been over a decade since Grand Theft Auto V came out, and while it was being worked on in some capacity in that time, Rockstar has been focusing on <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-development-on-grand-theft-auto-vi-only-began-in-earnest-in-2020/">GTA VI's development "<em>in earnest</em>" since 2020</a>. Zelnick also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-to-2026-was-important-for-allowing-rockstar-to-seek-perfection-says-take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick/">previously called the delay to 2026 "<em>important</em>" </a>to ensure that Rockstar had the chance to "<em>seek perfection</em>" with this release.</p>



<p>But even Zelnick cushioned his comments to CNBC to say that he and Take-Two are trying not to "<em>pump expectations</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We try not to pump expectations. Rockstar's whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still beat them. I know that's their goal. I know it's going to be an amazing game</em>," said Zelnick.</p>



<p>We'll see how things look in six to seven months from now, when we're on the doorstep to its current May 26, 2026, release date. Hopefully by that time we'll have a clear idea if Zelnick was right to express confidence here. </p>

			<p>The first weekend of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> Beta can surely be deemed a success. Its concurrent player count on Steam was in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-surpassed-battlefield-2042-all-time-concurrent-player-count-steam/">hundreds of thousands off the jump, immediately surpassing Battlefield 2042</a>. It then continued to rise to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">nearly half a million players, again, on Steam alone</a>, and it eventually did pass half a million, even beating the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">highest concurrent player count of Call of Duty on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>On that kind of popularity alone, it was a successful weekend. Adding the fact that the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mky5ll/unpopular_opinion_battlefield_6_is_better_than/">community seems to be on board with Battlefield 6</a> makes it an even bigger success. But it was also immediately successful in helping out Electronic Arts as a whole.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-beta-pushes-eas-stock-to-all-time-high">MP1st</a>, the Battlefield 6 beta helped spike EA's stocks, with share prices rising <strong>4.7%</strong>, it's largest increase since the end of last month. EA shares were trading at <strong>$176.11</strong> a share thanks to this rise, giving EA an estimated $42 billion evaluation.</p>



<p>It's alltogether a strong start for the series return and its attempt to bring back what used to be an annual bout between Call of Duty and Battlefield, where both sides had nearly equal footing in the shooter space as both series tried capturing players attention. It's unfortunately been a one-sided fight in recent years, with Battlefield barely able to hold a candle to the kinds of numbers Call of Duty is capable of. </p>



<p>This is the first time in what feels like a long time that Battlefield has the chance to take back its slice of the pie that Call of Duty had subsumed. We'll see how this next beta weekend goes, which at the time of this writing is due to start tomorrow, August 14, and run until Sunday, August 17. After that, it'll be a long stretch to October when the game is set to launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Battlefield 6 is able to stick the landing, and carry this momentum all the way to a strong launch and an even stronger first year.</p>
