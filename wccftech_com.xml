			<p>Today, Activision has confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remaster-supposedly-being-shadow-dropped-at-xbox-game-showcase-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier rumors</a> that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is indeed in development and will be released on July 11 on all leading gaming platforms, including PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. Truth be told, leakier extas1s said it would be shadow-dropped during Microsoft's Xbox Game Showcase in June, but July certainly isn't too far off that mark.</p>
<p>Anyway, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is coming, which is the most important thing for fans after the skater himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a false start a while ago when Vicarious Visions got merged with Blizzard. This time, the remake is being made by Iron Galaxy, the developer that was behind the PC port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> and also the studio picked by Naughty Dog to port both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II to the PC platform.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 includes everything in the original, plus new skaters and parks, extra tricks, and new tracks to crank up. Iron Galaxy says that the parks from both games have been authentically recreated with streamlined goals in a two-minute format. New parks include the so-called Waterpark with its grindable slides and a drained lazy river that's tailor-made for vert trick combos.</p>
<p>Through in-game challenges, players will earn in-game cash and access new gear, including new decks, grip tapes and wheels for their boards, and extra apparel for their skaters. Cross-platform online multiplayer supports up to eight skaters at a time. Iron Galaxy also added a New Game+ mode where players can retain the stats they had previously earned in their first playthrough.</p>
<p>Newcomers should have an easier way in thanks to an in-game tutorial led by Tony Hawk himself, featuring lessons on the all-important Ollie, kick flips, vert tricks, grinds, reverts, manuals, special tricks, and more. Last but not least, the original soundtrack has been expanded with new music.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 on all platforms except Nintendo Switch will provide access to the Foundry Demo due to launch in June, including two playable skaters, two parks, and a selection of songs. Players who pre-order the game will also gain instant access to the in-game Wireframe Tony Shader at launch.</p>
