			<p>If you're experiencing matchmaking issues with the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, you're not alone, as several players have reported being unable to get into matches as week two of the open beta kicked off today. EA is aware of the problem, and is working to solve it, though a fix has yet to be released.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955909461945540643">In a post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) from the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm">official Battlefield Comms account</a>, EA told players that "<em>The team is aware of ongoing matchmaking issues for some of our players when attempting to matchmake on playlists</em>. <em>We're actively investigating this and working towards a solve as soon as possible.</em>"</p>



<p>A dozen or so minutes later, the account posted an update, advising players to check that they are using the latest version of the Battlefield 6 Open Beta client, and that "<em>the team continues to assess</em>" the problem and is working to solve it. There's been no update since then as players continue to report issues.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Matchmaking Update 01 --</p><p>If you are currently experiencing matchmaking issues, please ensure that you have the most recent client update.</p><p>EA App: Repair functionality is available via the 3-dot button, and Repair.</p><p>The team continues to assess this. <a href="https://t.co/dy6jN88lMi">https://t.co/dy6jN88lMi</a></p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955912712535380005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The only other updates from EA on issues with the beta have been regarding a separate problem with DLSS and DLAA not being available. For that problem, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955928357909975127">EA said that</a> "<em>The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS/DLAA active once again with the Battlefield Open Beta. We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly</em>."</p>



<p>Even with week two of the open beta kicking off with technical problems galore, it's arguably been a strong start for the beta. At the time of this writing, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 385,680 people playing the beta on Steam alone. We'll see once the weekend properly kicks off if week two is of the beta is able to surpass week one's staggering 521,079 concurrent player count on just one platform.</p>



<p>Though EA would have to solve these matchmaking problems first. Hopefully, a fix is pushed before the end of the day.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">Saber Interactive</a> and NBC Universal have finally shown a little bit more about the first-person horror game that takes players back 65 million years, Jurassic Park: Survival. In a behind-the-scenes feature that includes commentary from both Saber and Universal's teams on how the studios worked to recreate the park from the original film into a game.</p>



<p>The feature provides details on the game's protagonist, Dr. Maya Joshi, the work that went into ensuring animations for the dinosaurs were as accurate as possible, and how Saber has been leaning on its collaboration with Universal to be as detailed as it can when it comes to recreating every element from the first film that fans of the series would recognize.</p>



<p>In between all that, there are a few very short looks at the first-person gameplay, though the feature doesn't dig any deeper into the different gameplay elements we see, like a handheld map and compass Dr. Joshi is using to try and get around the island, and what appears to be a noise meter, helping her to know how loud she's being in any given situation.</p>

<p>All the footage shown is marked as 'pre-alpha,' though even in this unfinished state, it is already beginning to look impressive. That said, it's likely a disappointing sign for anyone who is anxious to get their hands on Jurassic Park: Survival, since this is the first look at the game we've had since its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzJ9gf-TbWc">December 2023 announcement trailer,</a> and this kind of a feature makes it feel like the game's development is progressing slowly.</p>



<p>But that's just worried speculation as someone who is very much looking forward to the final product. Jurassic Park is a series that videogame horror fans have long recognized as a good foundation for a horror game. Hopefully, whenever the game does come out (cause there's still no confirmed release window, let alone release date), it's able to deliver on the experience of just how harrowing it would be to be trapped on Isla Nublar.</p>
