			<p>Nearly a month after the release of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, former Creative Director and The Chinese Room Studio Head Dan Pinchbeck opened up on the game's development phase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyWDyNLAo1E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a video interview with YouTuber Cat Burton</a>. </p>



<p>The most interesting tidbit is that Pinchbeck really didn't want to call this game Bloodlines 2. As you might recall, The Chinese Room only came in to rescue the game from cancellation after publisher Paradox Interactive split with the original developer of the sequel, Hardsuit Labs. That also meant they didn't have enough time or money to make it the true sequel fans of the original might have wanted. Apparently, it was Pinchbeck who decided to make it a more focused, Dishonored-like game, due to the constraints the developers were forced to work with.</p>



<p><em>We used to sit there and go and have these planning sessions of how do we get them to not call it Bloodlines 2. That feels like the most important thing we do here, is to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. You can't make Bloodlines 2. There's not enough time. There's not enough money. Bloodlines 1 came out at a really interesting period in game development, when you could ship a really ambitious game that was full of bugs and holes, was totally flawed, but the ambition was really exciting. A lot of those games, they're real cult games now, but they really weren't very good when you actually broke them apart and analyzed them. Great ideas, wonderful ideas, players loved them. You couldn't get away with it now.</em></p>



<p><em>So, trying to recreate that magic in a different environment felt wrongheaded. No one would be happy. You wouldn't make people who love Bloodlines 1 happy and you wouldn't make people who didn't know about Bloodlines 1 happy, because they'd never get Bloodlines 2 and they'd always get a flawed game that was built too fast and with not enough money.</em></p>



<p><em>So we approached it from that point of view of, well, what can we do with the time and the money that's available, and at that point, I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make Skyrim, but we can make Dishonored.' We would look at something which is not an RPG and is not fully open world, but is really tightly focused and true to the mythos, and it's a good ride, we get a Bloodlines title out in the world, and then we'd started talking about saying, then what would the next big Bloodlines game look like after that, if that happened?</em></p>



<p>It's a sound strategy, in theory. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the game is going to sell enough to warrant a bigger, better sequel. According to estimates based on SteamDB data, only between 120K and 300K copies of the game have been sold so far via PC's most popular store. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review of the game</a>, I concluded that Bloodlines 2 is worth playing despite its flaws, but only for fans of the setting and once the game is significantly cheaper than the launch price. However, that might happen very soon.</p>

			<p>Although it has provided some inspiration to The Witcher IV developer CD Projekt Red, future games from the studio won't be anything like Larian Studios' Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-is-an-inspiration-for-cd-projekt-but-its-all-in-on-big-open-worlds-we-are-definitely-not-going-to-make-a-game-like-larian-did/">PC Gamer</a>, CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski confirmed that Baldur's Gate 3 provided the developer a lot of inspiration, but they will still stick to the open-world setting seen in games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. Obviously, CD Projekt Red isn't going to simply create similar games with better graphics, as Nowakowski highlighted that the studio wants to <em>"innovate."</em></p>



<p>Although the CD Projekt's joint CEO did not elaborate on how they plan to innovate their open-world formula in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>, it seems that world interactivity will be enhanced over older games.</p>



<p><em>"That's the kind of game they can make,"</em> Michał Nowakowski said about Larian Studios' games like the Divinity: Original Sin series and Baldur's Gate 3. <em>"But a lot of stuff with how they can interact with the world and what it does was, for sure, some inspiration to us."</em></p>



<p>Much of Baldur's Gate 3's success resides, in my opinion, exactly in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">how the world feels incredibly dynamic and reactive</a>, so it's great to hear that The Witcher IV may take the best of Larian Studio's approach for the third entry in the beloved series and apply it to its open-world formula to improve the experience. As good as The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are, their open worlds adhere to traditional by-the-books design without shaking them up significantly, so I am very interested to see how much this influence will shape their sequels.</p>



<p>One thing The Witcher IV is not going to feature for certain is new contributions from Andrzej Sapkowski, author of the novels upon which the CDPR series is based. According to the author, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-have-any-new-contribution-from-andrzej-sapkowski/">the developer rarely asks him for details nowadays</a>, but their relationship remains healthy after <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/">the signing of a new deal in December 2019.</a></p>
