			<p>The new Oblivion Remastered patch released <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-patch-1-2-reduce-stutters/">earlier this week</a> brings some performance improvements over the previous version of the game, but the game is still very far from being in an optimal state, as even hgih-end hardware struggles running the game at high native resolutions without Frame Generation.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by MxBenchmarkPC compares the 1.2 version of the game with the launch version, highlighting how the performance improvements promised in the patch notes are indeed noticeable, but the overall situation is still not optimal. In a GPU-limited scenario on an RTX 5080, with NVIDIA DLSS in quality mode, ultra settings, and no Frame Generation, one of the most powerful GPUs on the market struggles to hit the 60 FPS mark at 4K resolution, and the 70 FPS mark at 1440p resolution, but even in a CPU-limited scenario, performance is far from being optimal, given the hardware. Things don't fare any better at native resolution, as the game runs at barely above 30 FPS at native 4K resolution, and in the 40s FPS range with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode. To hit anything past the 60 FPS mark, Oblivion Remastered needs Frame Generation, which is baffling, considering the GPU the game is running on, but sadly not surprising, considering the remake of the fourth entry in the series is most definitely not the only game powered by Unreal Engine 5 that doesn't run well on PC.</p>

<p>After being rumored to be in the works for a while, Oblivion Remastered was finally revealed and launched this April. Although the shift in atmosphere may be difficult to ignore for some players, and the performance leaves a lot to be desired, the new version of the classic RPG by Bethesda is one worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake is reportedly launching next year, but it may not feature the experience offered by the original in its entirety.</p>



<p>In a recent video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming">Rebs Gaming</a> reported to have talked with two unnamed sources who have connections with Halo series developers. Both have reported that the remake of the first entry in the series will be released to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary next year. The remake, whose development reportedly began in 2023, however, may only feature the single-player campaign, as both sources have heard nothing about multiplayer. Nothing has been said if the yet-to-be-announced remake will also launch on consoles other than Xbox Series X and S, but if it indeed is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unrevealed-new-halo-game-could-launch-on-playstation-5-according-to-new-information/">unrevealed project discovered last month by dataminers</a>, there's the chance it will also mark the series debut on PlayStation 5, much like <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War Reloaded</a> is marking the debut of another of Xbox's tentpole franchises on Sony's console next month.</p>



<p>Besides talking about the Halo Combat Evolved remake, Rebs Gaming also provided an update on Project Ekur, the rebranded battle royale project originally in development as part of Halo Infinite's multiplayer offerings, which was reportedly given to Certain Affinity. While the state of the project is unknown at the moment, known Halo series dataminer grunt.api recently teased some news by posting a new ID code for the game, which was confirmed to be for the project and that is seeing consistent updates in the past few days, indicating that work is continuing.</p>

<p>Although the Halo Combat Evolved remake has yet to be announced, it will not take long to learn if the project is indeed real, as Halo Studios will reveal what's next for the series at <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">HaloWC 2025</a>, which is taking place in October 2025. Hopefully, we will better understand how the future will shape up for the series that has represented Xbox the most since Microsoft entered the console market after the teased reveals.</p>

			<p>The games industry is undergoing some radical changes, and the challenges it is facing are caused more by the dominance of Fortnite and other popular live service and forever games than subscription services like Xbox Games Pass, according to a well-known analyst.</p>



<p>Commenting on recent video game sales data, Circana (NPD) Executive Director and Video Games Industry Analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Mat Piscatella</a> mentioned how video game subscription spending in the United States reached an all-time high in May 2025 with $0.6 billion spent and achieving the third consecutive month of growth. The analyst speculates that the spending increase in subscription services could be related to inflation and general economic uncertainty, making users look for value, which a service like Xbox Game Pass definitely provides.</p>







<p>Replying to a user mentioning the narrative that subscription services are killing the video games industry, Mat Piscatella highlighted how top live service games like Fortnite are more of a threat to the industry than services like Xbox Game Pass. The top 10 live service games are sucking nearly half of all gaming hours from the PlayStation and Xbox ecosystems before any other game can even get a taste of their popularity, so much so that, in every presentation given, the analyst points out that the biggest competitor to any new game or service is Fortnite. Compared to what the Epic Games' title, Minecraft and Roblox are doing, nothing else really matters.</p>







<p>This isn't the first time this week that we have heard how competing with games like Fortnite will become increasingly difficult. <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-games-industry-is-facing-a-fundamental-realignment-june-2025/">A few days ago</a>, Square Enix's former Director of Business provided a rather in-depth analysis of the gaming industry's current state and how its transition to a social network of games phase is likely to shape its future.</p>
