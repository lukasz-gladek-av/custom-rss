			<p>Smite 2 has been in Alpha for a little while now, with new Gods being added pretty consistently to the game. At the moment, there are only two modes available, with players having the choice between playing Arena or Conquest. However, the MOBA is now set to enter Open Beta, allowing any who are interested to start playing it as of January 14. So, for those interested, you won't have long to wait.&nbsp; The game has been progressing at a steady rate, with most of the team at Hi-Rez swapping working on Smite to Smite 2. For those who haven't had access to Smite 2, there was a confirmed skeleton crew to be working on Smite just for small updates.</p>
<p>However, as they rearranged the team working on Smite, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/">led to layoffs</a> at the company that was not disclosed in the statement that Stewart Chisam wrote, but that the changes were "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was originally released in 2014, with its successor announced 12 months ago. This came after Hi-Rez celebrated 10 years of Smite, and now they are working on a new and improved that comes with multiple new Gods and plans to keep the game in action late into the 2030s.</p>
<p>At the moment, those who have wanted to play Smite 2 will have had to get a key for the Alpha via Smite 2 streams or purchase <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Founder's Pack on Steam</a>, which would give them extra bonuses in addition to access to the game as it develops.</p>
<p>With the release of the Free to Play Open Beta, it means that all of the pre-existing players and those who are just joining will get access to a ton of new content that will become available during this period specifically.</p>
<p>This includes five new Gods that will be added to the game, including Aladdin. Along with the variety of Gods in the game, there will also be three new game modes to jump into. These are Joust, Duel, and Assault, offering plenty of options for players who don't get on with the Conquest and Arena game modes that were already in the game. You can check out the Aladdin gameplay in the video below.</p>

<p>Will you be picking up Smite 2 in the Open Beta? If so, what Gods do you plan on playing?</p>

			<p>Amidst several announcements of new handhelds powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Ryzen Z2 processor</a>, Microsoft also talked about its upcoming highly anticipated Xbox handheld at CES 2025.</p>
<p>The Verge was able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discuss the subject with Jason Ronald</a>, Vice President of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem at Microsoft. Ronald, who previously led the development of the Xbox One X and Xbox Series S|X console launches, promised that the Xbox handheld would offer users the best of console and PC put together.</p>
<p><em>We’ve been really innovating for a long time in the console space, and as we partner across the industry it’s really about how do we bring those innovations that we’ve incubated and developed in the console space and bring them to PC and bring them to the handheld gaming space.</em></p>
<p><em>I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console. What we’re doing is we’re really focused on how do we bring those experiences for both players and developers to the broader Windows ecosystem.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re focused on really simplifying that and making it much more like a console experience. Our goal is to put the player and their library at the center of the experience and not all the Windows work that you have to do today.</em></p>
<p>The launch of the Xbox handheld isn't quite imminent, but Ronald teased that Microsoft would share a lot more later this year.</p>
<p>There have been rumors about Microsoft's handheld projects for years. Head of gaming Phil Spencer finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed it</a> with his recent comments but also said the handheld is still 'a few years' out. Putting two and two together, it sounds like late 2026 could be a likely release window. The new Xbox home console is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to debut in late 2026</a>.</p>
