			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> had more than a few big announcements, and it also saw the return of one of the industry's most notable indie developers, with Braid and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-witness-review-life-puzzle/">The Witness developer</a> Jonathan Blow and his team at Thekla, Inc., announcing their next project, Order of the Sinking Star. </p>



<p>It's a narrative puzzle game set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026 that Blow calls "<em>the biggest game I've worked on</em>," and a quick look at the trailer will make you understand why he describes it that way. It's a puzzle game on a scale you don't normally see, as you mash together different worlds and solve over a thousand puzzles crafted by Thekla Inc.</p>



<p>"<em>Order of the Sinking Star is the biggest game I've worked on, and also the most collaborative</em>," Blow said in a press release. "<em>It's a kind of game design supercollider that brings together ideas from many designers to create a puzzle landscape that's much more intricate and vast than what has come before." </em></p>



<p>"<em>We've successfully pushed the limits of what is possible in a puzzle adventure. The game is just incredibly complex and deep, and I can't wait to show more as we move toward launch in 2026.</em> <em>The game showcases design contributions from Alan Hazelden (A Monster's Expedition), Sean Barrett (Promesst), Jonah Ostroff (Heroes of Sokoban), Zach Polansky (Enigmash), Patrick Traynor (Patrick's Parabox), Marc ten Bosch (Miegakure), and several others</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>Announcing Order of the Sinking Star is a major moment for us, for Jonathan and his team,</em>" added Yoon Im, chief executive officer of Arc Games, the publisher behind Order of the Sinking Star, in a press release. "<em>It represents an exciting year ahead for all of us. It's an honour to support Jonathan to make his most ambitious project yet a reality, as we believe Order of the Sinking Star is set to be the premier and innovative puzzle adventure of this generation. This announcement today marks just the beginning of what we have planned for a game-changing year for us next year.</em>" </p>



<p>While Order of the Sinking Star is currently only set to arrive on PC, it will likely come to other platforms as the press release mentions that "<em>additional platforms and release timing for the game will be revealed at a later date</em>." So expect Order of the Sinking Star to be available on other platforms beyond PC, it just might not arrive on consoles at the same time.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/holiday-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store Holiday sale</a> has just started, mere weeks after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-opens-black-friday-cyber-monday-premium-editions-sale-now-with-gifting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Friday/Cyber Monday one</a>, and it begins with a big freebie: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hogwarts-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Avalanche Software's acclaimed open world third-person action/adventure game released in 2023 can be added permanently to your Epic Games Store library through December 18 at 5 PM.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Epic Games has partnered with publisher Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (which might be sold to <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Skydance</a>, depending on which company gets Warner Bros.) to promote Hogwarts Legacy across its games. Players who spend at least two hours in the world of Hogwarts Legacy (via the Epic Games Store) by December 18 at 11 AM Eastern Time can earn the Chocolate Frog Back Bling in Fortnite. This, of course, also applies to those who may have previously purchased the game via the store and spent two or more hours in the game. Later in December, the Fortnite Shop will feature outfits and accessories inspired by the Wizarding World. Players can customize each outfit to represent one of the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.</p>

<p>Rocket League is also celebrating the Harry Potter franchise as part of its annual Frosty Fest event. In the Hogwarts House Rivalry, players earn points by playing matches while representing a house. Players will also be able to celebrate their favourite house with challenge rewards and shop items. More details will be announced later this month.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the best-selling game in 2023</a>, beating even Call of Duty that year. <span>A Definitive Edition featuring additional content&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank">was reportedly in the works</a>&nbsp;with the help of Rocksteady; however, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled this project</a>.</span> </p>



<p>A sequel was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-wb-games-biggest-priority-but-itll-take-a-couple-of-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to be WBIE's top priority, which was no surprise given its excellent sales (over 35 million units to date). Of course, it will take some time to materialize. Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in February 2023</a> and received support for a while; taking a guess, Avalanche Software could be targeting a launch for the sequel at some point in 2028.</p>
