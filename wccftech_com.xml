			<p>It's been <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that DC Studios</a> is in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm for any upcoming DC video games. This was mentioned during a visit that brought the press out for a studio update on their upcoming films, shows, and games. Typically, games aren't included in these sorts of meetings, but after James Gunn was announced as co-head of DC Studios, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-boss-reveals-plans-to-expand-arkham-universe-beyond-suicide-squad/">announced a plan</a> to include games in an interconnected DC universe.</p>
<p>During this meeting, James Gunn confirmed that the heads of DC Studios have been meeting with WB Games Division Head JB Perrette, where they then meet with members of NetherRealm and Rocksteady.</p>
<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "it's really the first time its ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Gunn says that there are designs for the projects "in their very earliest stages," when he then goes on to talk about what the story could be for the character or the game's overall theme. However, when asked about when people will begin to see hints of video games coming in the DCU, James Gunn said that it will be a "couple years" from now.</p>
<p>There's also been no hints as to what kind of games will be in development. It's well-known and well-documented as to what fans would like. Fans have been waiting for Injustice 3 for nearly a decade. However, fans instead received Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. These are two games that did not perform well at all, with the support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ending last month.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO left</a> the company thanks to the major failure of the Suicide Squad game and MultiVersus. It's always been known that Marvel is more popular than DC in nearly every avenue, but especially when it comes to DC games. They are known for being hit or miss. However, with new Batman games reportedly in development, there is hope that these games will be as successful as the other Batman games that were released.</p>
