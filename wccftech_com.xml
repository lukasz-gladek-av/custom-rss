			<p>The modding scene of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 on PC is thriving, to say the least, with a dedicated community that even somehow managed to expand the PvE Operations mode to support <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 12 players</a>, as if it were an MMO-like raid.</p>
<p>Now, though, the developers from Saber Interactive have opened the door to much bigger and deeper tweaks and improvements to the game with the release of their internal development tool, the Integration Studio. The tool can be downloaded from the <a href="https://discord.gg/QRWxNCDDdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Marine 2 Modding Hub Discord channel</a> and weighs less than 50 MB. Here's what Space Marine 2 Game Director Dmitry Grigorenko said in the announcement:</p>
<p><em>This is the exact same editor we use internally for all gameplay development. No more editing files in Notepad and praying you didn’t miss a bracket — Integration Studio makes editing anything SSL-related ten times faster, safer, and more intuitive.</em></p>
<p><em>With this first release, you’ll be able to work with:</em><br>
<em>• Level scenarios</em><br>
<em>• Game modes</em><br>
<em>• Individual blueprints — and even write your own gameplay logic</em><br>
<em>• AI Behavior Trees (work in progress)</em><br>
<em>• The AI Director</em><br>
<em>• Abilities and melee combo logic</em><br>
<em>• VFX editing — now 100x easier</em><br>
<em>• UI and HUD elements</em><br>
<em>• …and more to come</em></p>
<p><em>And this is only the beginning.</em></p>
<p><em>Not long ago, I promised we would support the modding scene — and we meant it. Watching this community grow, push boundaries, and create incredible experiences has been both inspiring and humbling. We’re excited to see what you build next — whether it’s a cinematic campaign, wild new game mode, or something we never saw coming.</em></p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has been a smashing success for Saber Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling over five million units in around three months</a> on the market. It was so successful that they already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Space Marine 3, although there's still a meaty content roadmap planned for the current game, and the release of the modding tools will undoubtedly improve the game's longevity for PC users.</p>

			<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been delayed, developer Skydance Games has announced, with the game now aiming to arrive sometime in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>A couple of months prior to this announcement, Black Panther voice actor Khary Payton <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-the-hydra-could-launch-this-holiday-says-voice-actor/">suggested</a> that the game would be arriving this coming holiday season. Well, clearly, plans changed compared to what Payton was last told, as Skydance says the decision to delay the game was made to give the team more time to "<em>add more polish</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early 2026</em>," developer Skydance Games began in its short statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">X</a>. "<em>Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!</em>"</p>
<p>Published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-to-be-published-by-plaion/">Plaion</a> and developed by a team at Skydance Games led by the legendary Amy Hennig, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has a lot of strong potential. The few trailers <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/">we've seen</a> depict a pretty impressive-looking game and a story that could be one of the better tales we've gotten from anything Marvel in recent years.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see some gameplay by now, though, as we've all been waiting since <a href="https://wccftech.com/captain-america-black-panther-wwii-amy-hennig-confirmed/">2022</a> to see this game come to fruition. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-comes-to-los-angeles-again-from-june-6-9/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> right around the corner, there's always a chance we're not too far off from getting that first gameplay look.</p>
