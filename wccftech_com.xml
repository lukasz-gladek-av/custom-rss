			<p>The first PlayStation 5 Pro teardown video was shared online today, providing a better look at the new console launching in a few days worldwide.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by Brazilian channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TAG22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TAG</a>, provides a good look at the console's internal components, cooling solution and more, and it is a very interesting watch even for those who don't speak Portuguese and want to see how much the console differs from the base model.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 PRO POR DENTRO ðŸ‘ŠðŸ˜ƒ | PS5 PRO teardown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1VSPgqY7Yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As confirmed in the teardown video above, the PlayStation 5 Pro features a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-improvement-repairability/">major repairability improvement</a> that grants easy access to the system's CMOS battery, allowing users to easily swap it out and ensure the console will continue to function normally in case the original battery runs out or becomes defective over time.</p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro specs were widely known already thanks to the many rumors that circulated online in the past few months, we have learned today that the system features an additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-specs-leak-unveils-2-extra-gb-of-ddr5-ram/">2 GB of DDR 5 RAM</a>, which is likely reserved for the OS. As such, developers should be able to utilize 16 GB for games, something that is not possible on the base model because some RAM has to be reserved for the OS.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

			<p>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro</a> isn't officially out until November 7, some people have started getting their hands on Sony's revised PlayStation 5 console. An unboxing video was posted a couple of days ago and quickly taken down; now, Brazilian content creator Brunno Fast has also managed to secure a console and subsequently <a href="https://x.com/brunno_fast/status/1852829727234379871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full spec sheet document included in the box.</p>
<p>By far the biggest surprise is that Sony added 2GB of DDR 5 RAM. These are likely to be reserved for the OS so that game developers can fully utilize the 16 GB of GDDR6 for the actual games. Beyond that, it's largely what we already knew.</p>

<p>To recap, the PS5 Pro offers 67% greater computing power than the base PS5 in terms of raw TFLOPS. According to Sony, this translates into around 45% faster rendering on average.

According to the developers of The First Descendant, it can stand up to the quality of any upscalers, even NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the PS5 Pro officially launches next Thursday in stores globally. It will be priced at $699/Â£699/â‚¬799.</p>

						<h5>Razer Kraken V4 Pro</h5><p><span>September 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>At RazerCon 2024, Razer announced a new entry in its popular Kraken headset seriesâ€”the Kraken V4 Pro. The pro model joins the new Kraken V4 and V4 X, which were both released back in August of this year. Whereas the V4 X headset is a wired model, the V4 and V4 Pro are wireless offerings offering THX Spatial Audio and Razer Chroma RGB lighting.</p>
<p>The major difference between the two wireless models? The Pro model comes with Razerâ€™s Sensa HD haptics and an OLED control HUB. Another difference is the price tag: the regular V4 sells for $179.99, whereas the Pro model goes for a whopping $399.99. Is this difference justified? Letâ€™s find out.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The Kraken V4 Pro comes with a carry pouch</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Features and Design</strong></p>
<p>Selling for $399.99, Razer's latest outing doesn't come cheap. It's almost double the price of the regular V4 model and $70 more expensive than one of its main rivals, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a>.</p>
<p>Razer's premium headset comes with 40mm dynamic bio-cellulose drivers for a natural high-end sound (the regular V4 comes with 40mm Titanium drivers). Like the V4, the Pro model packs Razer's HyperClear Super Wideband microphone and the brand's HyperSpeed Wireless 2.4Ghz tech. In addition, the headset offers support for Bluetooth 5.3 with simultaneous audio. Although the V4 Pro will likely be used wirelessly, the headset can also connect wired via USB Type-A and a 3.5mm jack (on the supplied control HUB).</p>
<figure><figcaption>The OLED hub that comes with Razer's Pro offering</figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-5x-wireless-first-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arctis Nova 5&nbsp; Wireless</a> from SteelSeries, the sides of the earcups can be distinguished easily through an "L" and "R" print on the fabric inside the earcups, which I prefer over the often tiny and dark-colored letters on the hinges.</p>
<p>The V4 Pro comes with a simple carry pouch, but being Razer's top-line headpiece,&nbsp; I would have expected a more premium carry case (like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/razer-barracuda-pro-missed-opportunity/#:~:text=Boom%20mics%20that%20come%20with,audio%20experience%20in%20most%20circumstances." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razer's Barracuda Pro model</a>).</p>
<p>The left earcup features the microphone mute button, a status indicator, the volume wheel, a power button, and a USB-C charging port. Both the power button and volume wheel are textured and easily discernable while wearing the headset. On the left, we also find the retractable wideband mic. The right earcup packs the headset's Sensa HD Haptics function button as well as a multifunction button, which allows users to control audio EQ, Bluetooth pairing, and the wireless mode switch button.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Chroma RGB lighting in action</figcaption></figure>
<p>The customizable Chroma RGB lighting adds a nice touch, allowing some personalization to match your gaming setup. While it may not be a game-changer, it does enhance the headset's aesthetic appeal. On the other hand, this might mainly be a feature for streamers, as the user doesn't see the lighting when wearing the headset.</p>
<p><em><span>Sensa HD Haptics</span></em></p>
<p>One of the main features of Razer's premium outing is the brand's Sensa HD Haptics, which aims to enhance the gaming experience. The haptic feedback effectively brings in-game sounds to life, allowing players to feel the rumble of explosions or the subtle vibrations of footsteps nearby. This tactile response can heighten your sense of presence in a game, making those intense moments even more engaging. While the haptics tech works with all audio content, the tech really shines when playing supported games, including Final Fantasy XVI, Silent Hill 2, Once Human, Hitman, MechWarrior 5, as well as the upcoming S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl.</p>
<p>However, while the Sensa HD Haptics is a fun feature, it may not be for everyone. Some users might find it overwhelming or distracting during extended gameplay sessions. Additionally, the overall effectiveness can vary greatly depending on the type of game being played; certain titles really shine with the haptics, while others may not utilize it as effectively.</p>
<p><span><em>OLED Hub</em></span></p>
<p>Another selling point of the Kraken V4 Pro is the supplied OLED hub, which allows for wireless connection between the headset and PC/console and provides real-time information on audio settings, battery life, and even customizable profiles. This makes it easy to monitor and adjust player preferences on the fly.</p>
<p>Through the hub, users can adjust the sound using the Audio EQ, but unfortunately, this is only available for the custom sound profile. Disappointingly, the other EQ profiles can't be modified. To fully configure settings, players will need to download Razer's new Synapse 4 software for PC. This software provides additional options for the headset, including a microphone EQ, additional audio settings, and THX Spatial Audio, which is only available on PC. As such, the Kraken V4 Pro is mainly a PC headset, although advertised as a multi-platform offering.</p>
<p>While the OLED hub is a great visual addition, its practicality might not be fully realized by all users. Some may find that the features, while visually appealing, donâ€™t significantly enhance their gaming experience. Additionally, it requires some setup and may take a little time to get used to for those who prefer simplicity.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort and Sound Performance</strong></p>
<p>Comfort is somewhat of a mixed bag. The memory foam ear cushions provide a decent fit initially, but after a few hours, the headset can start to feel heavy and uncomfortable; after a few hours of usage, I could feel a clear strain on the top of my head. For gamers who often engage in marathon sessions, this can be a significant drawback.</p>
<p>The sound quality that the Kraken V4 Pro is good, although it appears to be focused on competitive gamers. Razer appears to have focused on the midranges in order to allow those players to pinpoint exact positions with plenty of detail. The bass, however, is somewhat modest, even after adjusting the EQ. This can result in some details in the lower sound spectrum being lost, which is unfortunate. Additionally, the lower tones seem a bit unbalanced when compared to the midrange.</p>
<p><span>Microphone</span></p>
<p>The Kraken V4 Pro's microphone offers good enough sound quality; it captures voice well enough, although some might find that it makes your voice sound tinny. Being a premium headset, however, I expected a bit more from this microphone. On the other hand, it's adequate for communication during gaming sessions and works well for casual streaming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PXL_20240927_212224046-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Battery Life</strong></p>
<p>Although not bad, battery life is somewhat of a letdown when using the headset's 'Pro' features. While Razer claims up to 30 hours of use, I found the reality closer to 13 to 15 hours when utilizing both the haptic feedback and RGB lighting. This can be frustrating, particularly during longer gaming sessions, where frequent charging might become a hassle. Granted, when not using RGB lighting and the haptics tech, the battery can last up to roughly 50 hours, but not using the headset's 'Pro' features to save battery shouldn't be as it was intended.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In summary, while the Razer Kraken V4 Pro offers some appealing features, its high price, subpar battery life, and moderate comfort level make it hard to recommend over more affordable alternatives. On top of that, although advertised as a multi-platform headset, the 'Pro' features are mainly reserved for use on PC.&nbsp; If youâ€™re considering this headset, itâ€™s worth exploring other options that deliver similar performance without breaking the bank.</p>
