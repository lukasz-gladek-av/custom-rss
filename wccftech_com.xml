			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Naughty Dog and Sony Interactive Entertainment have announced that The Last of Us Part II Remastered is coming to PC on April 3, 2025. That's around a year after the arrival of Part I.</p>
<p>The Remastered version launched on PlayStation 5 earlier this year. Francesco De Meo wrote in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is, without a doubt, the best way to enjoy Naughty Dog's excellent survival horror game, thanks to the addition of the surprisingly fun No Return roguelike mode, the cut Lost Levels, developer commentary, and two display modes for a proper 4K resolution experience. The main campaign's bleak story remains as controversial as it was when the original game launched on PlayStation 4, but underneath it is one of the finest survival horror games ever made.</em></p>

<p>PlayStation 5 Pro owners can already <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play</a> an enhanced version, but the PC version might just be the Definitive Edition of Naughty Dog's masterpiece - provided it does not suffer from the issues of Part I's PC port.</p>

			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan, the action role-playing set in the Dungeon and Fighter universe, will launch in late March on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The latest cinematic trailer, shown during today's The Game Awards Show 2024, confirmed that the game will be released on March 27th, 2025, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. In addition, a playable demo will be released in a little over a month, on January 16th, to allow players to get a taste of the experience before release.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan | Release Date Trailer | Begin Your Vengeance on March 27, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QGALVsiwYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan will be an action role-playing game that will be worth the time of those looking for a challenging experience with some similarities with the Souls series. In the past few months, I had the opportunity to try out the game, and I was thoroughly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/">impressed</a> by it, especially by its combat mechanics, so much so that it has become one of my most anticipated games launching in 2025.</p>
<p><em>The longer playtime of The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test also allowed me to appreciate combat more. While it is undeniable that the stamina-based combat system is very reminiscent of the Souls series, the Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nioh series influences are more prominent. For starters, the evade maneuver doesn't have a whole lot of invincibility frames, making it a little risky to use in close-quarter. The parry, called Brink Guard, on the other hand, is a much more effective defensive technique as it is generally easy to pull off and allows Khazan to stay on the offensive since there's a small cancel window at the end of each move that allows going into the guarding stance immediately, and it restores stamina while depleting the enemy's. An instant evade technique called Brink Evade, is also in, but it seems to interrupt the flow of combat when used to avoid attacks that could be parried.</em></p>

			<p>Today, a new entry in the Onimusha series, Onimusha: Way of the Sword, was announced for PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The first new entry in the series in a very long time was revealed today with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0auCmtj2K6g&amp;t=1s">intense trailer</a> shown during The Game Awards show which showed how the game will retain the unique atmosphere of the first few entries in the series but feature vastly different gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha Way of the sword  Trailer 4K - THE GAME AWARDS 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0auCmtj2K6g?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Onimusha: Warlords, a remaster of the first entry in the series, did not exactly set the world on fire, the announcement of Onimusha: Way of the Sword comes as an almost complete surprise. In case you haven't played the remaster, you can learn more about this remaster in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/onimusha-warlords-feudal-japan-evil/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Onimusha: Warlords is a game from another era and the remaster, despite its many enhancements, sadly highlights how the experience hasn't aged too well. This doesn't mean that the game isn't good, as many of its ideas, such as combat, leveling system and puzzles, only required a few small tweaks to be truly excellent. The fact that it's a game from 2001 is clear when playing the game, but Onimusha: Warlords can still provide a sweet, albeit short, experience.</em></p>
<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Saber Interactive announced Turok: Origins, an upcoming co-op game based on the classic IP. In this title, players will become Turok warriors to face off against ferocious dinosaurs and a terrifying alien threat that seeks to destroy all humanity. However, they'll be powerful enough to take them on with devastating attacks powered by weapons and abilities. They may also harness fallen enemies' DNA to upgrade their arsenal.</p>
<p>In Turok: Origins, players will join the fight either alone or as a team against a variety of dinosaurs, creatures, and bosses that take to the ground, sky, swamps, and caves to push their skills to the limit. Engage in intense combat, where players must use everything at their disposal to ensure success, including melee attacks, special abilities, and fine-tuned weapons. Throughout the game, they'll unlock and upgrade advanced weaponry to dominate battles and neutralize foes. Plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns, and more are all at disposal.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it will be possible to extract DNA from fallen enemies and the environment to unlock game-changing powers that evolve the Turoks' suit in real-time. Each DNA power not only enhances the character's look but also offers upgradable skills and abilities to give the players an edge in combat.</p>
<p>In the game's missions, players journey across deadly worlds on various planets. From ancient temples and wasteland canyons to dense jungles, each location is said to hold pieces of an unforgettable story packed with twists and turns.</p>
