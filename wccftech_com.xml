			<p>Three Fields Entertainment, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">founded by former Burnout developers</a> who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">released the open-world sandbox racer</a> Wreckreation, a game where you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">edit your race track and the world around you with a press of a button</a>, has launched a Patreon page to help keep the studio alive.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">launch this past October</a> was a commercial disappointment for Three Fields Entertainment, with players criticizing the myriad of technical issues and a lack of content at launch. It was so poor that a little over a month after launch, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">announced via a LinkedIn post that the entire studio's staff had been put on redundancy notice</a>, meaning they could all be laid off if things didn't improve.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark</em>," Sperry wrote in her post at the top of December. "<em></em><em>We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form.</em>"</p>



<p>That hasn't happened as of yet, but what has happened is that Three Fields Entertainment <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/u10680381">has launched a Patreon page to try to keep the studio alive</a>. The studio announced the Patreon page with <a href="https://x.com/ArcadeDriving/status/2000880860216660386">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, which it says was created as a response to players who asked how they could support the studio.</p>

<p>"<em>Patreon helps us keep our 10 person development team together and continue updating Wreckreation with the speed and responsiveness you've already seen</em>," the Patreon page reads, "<em>and we're doing this now because the next few months are crucial</em>."</p>



<p>The Patreon page continues to be, seemingly, very transparent about the realities that Three Fields is facing. The studio estimates it needs about $65,000 a month to keep the team together and the studio alive. It's currently looking for additional funding by trying to find new partners and pitching new projects, but we've seen studios shut down or, at the very least, <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-team-halved-by-massive-layoffs-following-disappointing-launch/">incur serious layoffs</a> while they look for funding from a new partner.</p>



<p>It's a difficult time <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">across the video games industry</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/keybanc-we-believe-intel-has-won-the-gpu-gaming-socket-for-the-nintendo-switch-3-on-18a-and-amd-faces-increasing-risks-from-a-price-war-with-intel/">across the tech industry overall</a>, with layoffs, studio shut-downs, and the constant concern of both happening hanging over the heads of developers. Hopefully, Three Fields Entertainment's story ends differently than how it ends for the majority of teams.</p>
