			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/resident-evil-requiem-pc-performance-analysis-tuning-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don't have the PC</a> to play <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s new <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> game, but you'd really love to experience it anyway? If you have a solid Internet connection (and live in a supported region of the world), <strong>NVIDIA</strong> can give you the chance through its <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> cloud platform, and they're also bundling the game with new 12-month Ultimate memberships. For the record, a year-long GeForce NOW Ultimate subscription sets you back <strong>$199.99</strong>, but the game itself is <strong>$70</strong>, which you'd be saving if you were planning on buying it anyway.</p>



<p>With GeForce NOW Ultimate, you'd have access to <strong>nearly all of the game's features available to GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU owners</strong>: NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and path tracing. The only thing not supported right now on the cloud is the new <strong>DLSS 4.5 second-generation transformer model</strong>, which debuted on local GPUs earlier this year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of features that the GFN Ultimate membership offers over the Free and Performance tiers:</p>



<ul>
<li>8-hour gaming sessions</li>



<li>Up to 5K resolution</li>



<li>Up to 240 FPS (360 FPS on RTX 5080 servers)</li>



<li>First priority access to the queue</li>



<li>16 vCPU cores 56 GB DRAM</li>



<li>Surround 7.1 audio</li>



<li>DLSS Frame Generation</li>



<li>NVIDIA Reflex</li>



<li>Cloud G-Sync</li>



<li>GeForce RTX 5080-class performance </li>



<li>DLSS Frame Generation (Multi-Frame Generation on RTX 5080 servers)</li>
</ul>



<p>Here's a tease <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-requiem-encyclopedia-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from our Resident Evil Requiem review</a>, penned by Nathan Birch:</p>



<p><em>Resident Evil Requiem is the Every-Evil, as Capcom has taken all the things they've done with the franchise over the past decade or so and stitched them together into a towering monster of a survival horror game. Parts of this game are the best, scariest, and most intense this series has ever been, other parts are merely alright, but no part of the game is bad and it's all very distinctly Resident Evil. While it won't be everyone's new favorite, Resident Evil Requiem should hit enough right notes for most fans.</em></p>



<p>Besides CAPCOM's latest entry in the renowned survival horror series, <strong>here's the full list of new GeForce NOW games joining the library this week</strong>:</p>

			<p>After the massive flop that was 2024's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></strong>, the whole industry could feel that <strong>Warner Bros'</strong> games division was not in a good place. So when we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/"><strong>Monolith Productions</strong>, <strong>Player First Games,</strong> and <strong>San Diego Studio</strong> had all been shut down</a> just two months into 2025, it was upsetting, especially in the case of Monolith, but we couldn't exactly call it surprising, even if <strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-over-40-million-units-to-date-confirms-wb/">continued to sell like gangbusters</a>.</p>



<p>What followed was a major reorganization of how Warner Bros. would approach games, focusing in on four verticals: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/"><strong>Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat</strong>, and the <strong>DC Universe</strong></a>. At the time, Warner Bros chief executive officer of global streaming and games, <strong>JB Perrette</strong>, said "<em></em><em>Our company is home to some of the biggest franchises in the world, and we are optimizing our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps to delight players and fans</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/biz/news/warner-bros-discovery-david-zaslav-hbo-sale-1236673449/">Variety</a>, Perrette has reiterated that 2025 was "<em>a year of reset</em>" for the company's gaming division, adding that the games team got "<em>distracted going after too many IPs with too broad a set of studios</em>." And while we only know of two game releases from Warner Bros in 2026, the upcoming (and highly anticipated)<a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-the-game-awards-2025/"> <strong>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</strong></a> and a Game of Thrones mobile title, Perrette went on to tease that bigger things are coming in the next couple of years.</p>



<p>"<em><strong>The real fruits will start coming in '27-'28</strong></em>," Perrette said, "<em>when we <strong>return to some of our biggest franchises</strong></em>."</p>



<p>The obvious guess is that Perrette is talking about <strong>Avalanche Software's</strong> upcoming Hogwarts Legacy <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/">sequel,</a> which was reportedly prioritized over making a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/">'Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition' of the breakout 2023 hit</a> because Warner Bros didn't believe it to be worth the cost over just focusing on making the sequel.</p>



<p>There's also the possibility that Perrette is referring to the return of the popular DC-focused fighting game series with <strong>Injustice 3</strong>, a game that was practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/superman-green-lantern-voice-actors-seemingly-confirm-injustice-3/">confirmed to be on its way last year by two members of its voice acting cast</a>. Meanwhile, WB Montreal is reportedly working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-might-be-making-dc-comics-live-service-game/">DC-based live service game</a>, which might not be the most exciting thing for players, but for an executive like Perrette, it wouldn't be surprising for him to have that project in mind when dropping hints about what's coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>All of those titles would qualify as Warner Bros returning to its "<em>biggest franchises</em>," so we'll just have to wait and see which of the four franchises WB is focusing on in its games division ends up being first down the line.</p>



<p>But this is all assuming that the major acquisition of Warner Bros from either <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/"><strong>Netflix</strong> or <strong>Paramount Skydance</strong></a> goes through without interrupting anything. A highly unlikely scenario, to be clear, and one that could cause us to go without another big game from any of WB's studios for years. We don't even know if Netflix will want to keep the games division going, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/">based on how much value it placed on it when it looked at the total value of Warner Bros</a>.</p>



<p>If WB ends up selling to Netflix, instead of hoping for a big WB game, we may be left simply hoping that WB is still making games by 2028.</p>
