			<p>Those eager to play Borderlands 4 were happy to learn that its launch date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/">moved up almost a week and a half</a>, from September 23rd to September 12th, but it wasn't just Borderlands fans who found this announcement interesting and exciting.</p>
<p>Players chomping at the bit to play Grand Theft Auto VI also got excited, because one potential reason for Borderlands 4 releasing earlier could be to give it more time to breathe before GTA VI arrives and absorbs all the attention in the video game industry. Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford says that's not the case, though.</p>
<p>"<em>Borderlands 4 shipping early is 100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates,</em>" Pitchford began in a post on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966">X</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our decision is literally 0% about any other product's actual or theoretical launch date</em>."</p>
<p>Pichford doesn't call out Grand Theft Auto VI, but it is almost certainly the game behind his vague "<em>any other</em> <em>product</em>" comment. Take-Two has always published the Borderlands series, but now it wholly owns the series and Gearbox. As the parent company for both Gearbox and Rockstar, Take-Two ultimately plays a huge role in planning the launch dates for the games in its portfolio.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible that Pitchford approached his bosses and told them the good news that, based on Gearbox's findings, Borderlands 4 would be ready just under a week and a half earlier than they'd already announced.</p>
<p>It's also possible that Pitchford's bosses at Take-Two asked Gearbox to do some background on whether they could release Borderlands 4 early to give it more room to breathe ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI. Or even that Pitchford proactively thought to look into the possibility of Borderlands 4 launching earlier than already announced, knowing approximately when GTA VI is due.</p>
<p>The final decision was likely still up to Pitchford and his team, and was almost certainly made for the reasons Pitchford lays out, but it's not the only truth that could exist in this scenario.</p>
<p>When Grand Theft Auto VI finally releases, it'll be one of the biggest releases in video game history. Other game studios are already looking to get out of its way, knowing that no one will be focused on anything besides GTA VI when it does release.</p>

			<p>Today, Funcom has shared a new Dune: Awakening trailer entirely focused on the game's extensive base-building feature, which improves upon the systems seen in Conan Exiles. Here's the transcribed overview provided by the narrating voice:</p>
<p><em>On Arrakis, exposure to the raw, unbridled elements is death. But walls alone will not save you from the maelstrom. You need power and the engineering of CHOAM to raise a protective shield against the storm. Without such protection, even the strongest walls will erode and fail in time, as will anything left in the open. Your exposed vehicle is beyond repair, but a lesson is learned.</em></p>
<p><em>You need better protection against the dangers of Arrakis. It's time to upgrade your base. Base construction and expansion can be done alone or together with others. With Celo projections, building as a group is easy. To further customize your base, you must align yourself with one of the warring Great Houses. Displaying your allegiance through their unique architecture, the Atreides welcome your aid. Swear your fealty to the Atreides and rise to greatness on Arrakis.</em></p>
<p><em>Your base serves as a reflection of both your influence and your allegiance to a faction. The safety provided by your base allows you to craft powerful new tools, technologies, and vehicles. Here we are crafting a ground car. Once each part of your vehicle is assembled, you can install modules to enhance its specialization further and customize its appearance.&nbsp; By aligning with the Atreides, you have earned the option to craft their faction-specific ground car. </em></p>
<p><em>On the horizon, another sandstorm approaches, but this time you are prepared. Your base is equipped with powerful shields for protection and a custom-built garage that will keep all your vehicles safe from the raging storm. The shields are vital, but they come with a cost. With a construction of this size, the Emperor demands taxes to keep your base running.</em></p>
<p><em>You will construct grand bases. And in Dune: Awakening, you will have the option to share them with others if you choose. All your creations can be recorded as blueprints. These can be shared with allies or even bought and sold on the Exchange. Anyone holding a blueprint can instantly</em><br>
<em>place a projection of the entire building and construct an exact copy for themselves. Dune: Awakening's building system allows for limitless creativity.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening Building Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hO9RUC2HBcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer also shows off some truly impressive bases. In the press beta test, there wasn't anywhere near enough time to build something so grand, but I still got a glimpse at the very solid building system. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing several hours of the game</a>, my doubts certainly lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn more about Dune: Awakening's crafting, building, and other features, Funcom held a more than two-hour-long developer live stream yesterday. The YouTube recording can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k0389iSNIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening launches on June 10 for PC after <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a slight delay</a>. A large-scale beta test will take place between May 9 and May 12, during which many players will be able to test it out before the release.</p>

<p>Today, NVIDIA also provided an update on the latest games that will adopt its DLSS upscaling technology. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in my hands-on, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is already implemented in the ARC Raiders Tech Test that begins today for the public. Of course, GeForce RTX 40 users can enable Frame Generation, and GeForce RTX 20/30 users can activate Super Resolution.</p>
<p>The recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> supports NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA, while also taking advantage of the ray tracing cores available in the RTX architecture if the user enables hardware-accelerated Lumen ray traced global illumination.</p>

<p>The roguelite first-person shooter game Deadzone: Rogue <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3228590/Deadzone_Rogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in early access this week with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA. Just like Oblivion Remastered, it also takes advantage of the RT Cores when enabling Lumen-based hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</p>
<p>The Wuxia open world action/adventure roleplaying game Where Winds Meet was also updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on top of Frame Generation and Super Resolution. According to NVIDIA, performance can be accelerated by 3.9X at 4K resolution and max settings. The GeForce RTX 5090 can run the game at over 500 frames per second. As a reminder, a new Closed Beta Test <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-new-cbt-set-for-may-16-19-on-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is coming in a couple of weeks</a>.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 is setting out to be one of the most impressive ports launching together with the system, as the game's latest footage highlights how a more recent build of this version of the open-world RPG by CD Projekt Red has already been improved over the one used to capture the reveal trailer.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared on YouTube, SuperMetalDave64 goes over the new footage released as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FeYJHMW9xY">Nintendo's Creator's Voice series</a>, taking a good look at the game's visuals and performance. The most noticeable improvement is regarding textures, as the sequence where V is talking with Johnny Silverhand inside a restaurant, for example, features more detailed textures than in the same sequence shown in the reveal trailer. Additionally, the graphics settings seen in the new footage, a mix of mid and high PC settings, which is incredibly impressive, given the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, and the stable performance in Dogtown, the demanding central location of the Phantom Liberty expansion which wasn't released on previous generation systems, highlight how the new Nintendo console is definitely capable of surpassing PlayStation 4 graphics and performance level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2077 Graphics Upgrade Confirmed in New Gameplay Trailer In-Depth Analysis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLYOReVmzXc?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeing Cyberpunk 2077 run on Nintendo Switch 2 in the way it currently does is extremely impressive, so it will be really interesting to see how the game will look at launch. Helping CD Projekt Red achieve this level of visual quality at solid performance is likely the use of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, which the game will employ in all of its display modes, both docked and handheld.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 complete with the Phantom Liberty expansion on June 5th, the same day the system launches worldwide, with some exceptions like China, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America, and the Caribbean.</a></p>
