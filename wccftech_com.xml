			<p>With tomorrow's update, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be added to Embark's free-to-play shooter game The Finals, which recently saw the beginning of Season 6 and the arrival of Team Deathmatch as a permanent mode for Quickplay. The game already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-f2p-fps-from-embark-supports-nvidia-dlss-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but the addition of Multi Frame Generation will boost frame rates even further for owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. This will be especially useful for those who play with RTXGI enabled.</p>
<p>An update is also adding NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to Enotria: The Last Song, the Soulslike game inspired by Italian folklore. Like The Finals, the game already had DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but the new patch unlocks even higher frame rates for RTX 50 owners.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered launched last week on PC. Despite NVIDIA originally claiming it would include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, it didn't really make it to the final game, as we explained <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our report</a>. In today's DLSS update, NVIDIA did not refer to that at all, mentioning only Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA. They did say the NVIDIA app now supports overriding Super Resolution from the old CNN model to the new transformer model.</p>

<p>Lastly, a new game due to launch on Steam Early Access this Friday will include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on day one. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827230/Wild_Assault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Assault</a>, a third-person class-based PvP multiplayer shooter game developed by Combat Cat. In this title, players will select from several anthropomorphic heroes featuring unique abilities based on the original animal that inspired them.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, the Unreal Engine 5 powered game runs 5X faster on average when activating DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. The flagship graphics card, the RTX 5090, can reach up to 415 frames per second at 4K with all settings maxed out and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>
