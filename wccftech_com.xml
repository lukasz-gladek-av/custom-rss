			<p>The Farm 51 has been working on Chernobylite 2 for over three years, and today, one of the most significant milestones for the team has been achieved. The Kickstarter campaign for this game has reached more than 200% of the initial funding goal. The team exceeded its campaign target with six stretch goals, which has allowed the team to secure additional expansion of the project beyond the original plans that were set in place. This includes extra locations to explore for both single-player and co-op missions, as well as a customizable interface. The Farm 51 has created an infographic that goes into detail about their Kickstarter, as well as the team's dedication to creating this new game.</p>

<p>The developers have announced that the Kickstarter campaign will continue to be live thanks to the option of Late Pledges, where those who pledge can still support the team and get some of the rewards that are available.</p>
