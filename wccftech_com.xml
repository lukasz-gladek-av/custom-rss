			<p>Sloclap's new football game, Rematch, is officially out, and in just the game's first 24 hours of being live for everyone, not just those who paid for early access a few days ahead of launch, <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1936061475447013553">Sloclap announced</a> that Rematch had&nbsp;<strong>1 million unique players</strong> running on to the pitch.</p>
<p>It's great news for Sloclap, but what was better news for players was Sloclap pushing a new hotfix for Rematch, which can be downloaded now on all platforms. Patch 0.5 adds a bug fix for the ball hitting the post and going out of sync with other players, though still notes that ball sync issues "<em>might still happen under other circumstances</em>."</p>
<p>And most importantly, this new hotfix includes fixes for stability issues, netcode improvements, and matchmaking updates to improve queue times.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it's been a great launch for Rematch, with more than 1 million unique players, and on Steam alone, hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/">92,841 concurrent players</a>. On the other hand, it's been fraught with bugs, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lg6j0f/please_consolidate_all_na_servers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">long queue times</a>, and Sloclap has already <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">talked about its priorities</a> when it comes to making more fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Crossplay support is at the top of the list, as it was just hours before the game released in its early access launch for the players who paid extra, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">crossplay support would not be in the game at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Sloclap has apologized for not telling players that crossplay would be missing sooner, and hopefully, it's not too long of a wait for the feature to be added.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A short video clip from the single-player campaign for the next mainline entry in the Battlefield series has been pulled from the files of the latest Battlefield Labs update, with dataminer <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535">Temporyal discovering and posting the clip to X</a>.</p>
<p>The footage is clearly still a work-in-progress which Temporyal points out, and they also clarify that this is not a clip of <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-battlefield-6-gameplay-has-leaked-with-over-90-minutes-of-ps5-gameplay-online/">gameplay from a playtest</a> or the<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-destruction-showcased-in-new-leaked-video/"> Battlefield Labs test</a> like we've seen with other leaks, but just a video file, which also explains why the footage lacks the watermarks that usually accompany your screen if you've ever participated in a closed playtest.</p>
<p>According to Temporyal, the clip "<em>shows the explosive finale of a mission to destroy a dam in Tajikistan</em>." Temporyal <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935724104931573958">also reveals that, based on their findings</a>, the campaign will be eight missions long, nine including a prologue, taking players to locations like Tajikistan, Egypt, the USA, and Gibraltar.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release for the next Battlefield game, and we don't even know what it's officially called. According to EA, we should know at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">one of those two things soon</a>, with a summer reveal currently set to happen at some unknown point in time from now until September, to be generous.</p>
<p>For all we've seen of the next Battlefield game through leaked footage like this, there's still a lot to be revealed. These leaks are useful to get a sense of what's to come, but they're never the full picture, and there's a lot riding on this next Battlefield game. It's no secret that EA is in need of a big win.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA canceled its Black Panther game,</a> shutting down the studio it had created to make that specific game and laying everyone off. It canceled another incubation project at Respawn and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">laid off more staff across Respawn</a> and other parts of the company. And at the beginning of the year, EA<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/"> laid off developers at BioWare</a> following the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and its disappointing sales, which reached only half of what EA's top brass had expected.</p>
<p>A report recently dug into everything that happened with The Veilguard's development, and how mismanagement by those <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">same leaders at EA plagued the game from the beginning of its development journey</a>.</p>
<p>Add all the layoffs, internal issues, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/">the sunsetting of hybrid work and a return-to-office call</a>, and game cancellations together, and add to that the fact that the latest entry in the company's biggest sports series <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/electronic-arts-says-dragon-age-and-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-as-it-revises-its-financial-outlook-downward/">underperformed last year</a>, and it doesn't paint a picture of a company that's all flowers and rainbows.</p>
<p>EA needs Battlefield to do well to potentially be a turning point for the company. When the full reveal comes this summer, depending on players reactions to the game, we'll see which way things are beginning to turn.</p>
