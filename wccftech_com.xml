			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> with several bugs and issues, which GSC Game World, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating</a> the million units sold milestone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-team-outlines-next-fixes-crashes-bugs-weapon-price-adjustments-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to resolve.</p>
<p>One of the main features that need care is the so-called A-Life AI and spawn system. While we wait to see if the developer will be able to fix it with an official patch, modder ConnerRia <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a mod called The Roadside Panic that aims to greatly improve the lively feeling of the Zone - although it might just kill your game's frame rate in the process. Here's the official overview from the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>This mod restores the chaotic dynamism of the old STALKER games. It also murders your frame rate, so you can enjoy the authentic 30fps 2007 Shadow Of Chernobyl gameplay experience.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unleashes the full potential of online A-Life</em></li>
<li><em>Heavily mitigates cases of enemies appearing out of thin air right behind you, like in that Reddit clip of the military base everyone keeps talking about</em></li>
<li><em>Significant extension of the A-Life range. NPC and NPC interactions can be seen and heard from afar.</em></li>
<li><em>Different factions will fight for territory at POIs.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>How Did You Fix "A-Life"?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Duct-tape. The AI director in STALKER 2 is actually very complex internally, however its function is gimped because of severe bugs compounding each other. I troubleshooted the present bugs to the extent of my ability and duct-taped a solution to coax the A-Life system into working around its own field of anomalies, so to speak. However, a couple of other issues with the A-Life system are breaking it and causing not only janky behavior but also flat-out non-existent A-Life simulation.</em></p>
<p><em>This mod should prevent or at least mitigate abrupt spawns and it will also deliver immersive A-Life interactions such as NPC-NPC firefights, of course.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What's The Catch?</em></strong><br>
<em><strong>Performance.</strong> This mod will slaughter your frames in an already unoptimized game. A top-of-the-line CPU is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Persisting Spawn Issues.</strong> As said before, the director is broken, and all a-life cfg tweaks are doing is finding brute-force methods to circumvent said issues to get more spawns and world events.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Roadside Panic - Stalker 2 A-Life Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e472boNXfIs?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With this mod, you can pick between three download options. The first, Roadside Panic, works at a radius of 800 meters but keeps the squad density of STALKER 2 as-is. The second, called Roadside Panic Lite, works in a 250-meter radius to mitigate bugs. If you're feeling really brave, though, the option for you is Roadside Panic, which works in an 800-meter radius but also cranks up the spawns a lot.</p>
<p>If you opt to try Roadside Panic, let us know in the comments about your experience.</p>

			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition-footage-system-requirements/">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition</a> mod is almost complete, and the unofficial remaster should be released before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Together with launching a new story-focused trailer, which doesn't feature interior lighting that will be added to the final version of the mod, Revolution Team confirmed that development is 95% complete and is now at the final testing stage. The developer discovered some unforeseen bugs that require fixing, so the mod's release may slip to January 2025, as they want to release the most functional version of the mod possible. Still, they are doing everything they can to get the Nextgen Edition of one of the best entries in the series out before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition mod has been in the works for some time, so it's definitely good to hear that development is almost over, as it is setting out to be one of the best ways to experience the classic open-world game developed by Rockstar Games complete with visuals and gameplay enhancements.</p>
<p>Those who cannot play Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition are still able to experience a remastered version of the game with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition remasters. The compilation was updated <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">earlier this month</a> with some enhancements only available for the mobile version of the compilation up until this month that address some of the issues of the PC and console release. You can learn more about it and the issues that plagued it at launch in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The Callisto Protocol PS5 Pro patch greatly enhanced image quality and performance while also introducing an 8K resolution mode that delivers a visual experience without compromise, according to a new analysis of the patch.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vez2JZxDYSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly podcast</a>, Digital Foundry provided their own analysis of the PS5 Pro patch released for Striking Distance's game, highlighting how the patch improves Performance Mode considerably by adding the ray tracing features only available in Quality Mode on the base model while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. This is seemingly achieved by lowering the resolution, as on the mid-generation console, the pixel count hits 1440p and 1296p in areas where it is higher on the base model's Performance mode, although the image is definitely sharper on the new system. In addition, the game also achieves better performance on the new PlayStation 5 model by using TAAU instead of AMD FSR 2 or PSSR, as the artifacts that indicate that either are being used are nowhere to be seen. As such, it is not clear if Striking Distance simply used the additional GPU power of the system to brute force these improvements in some ways or had access to the PS5 Po exclusive features that can only be used with more recent SDK versions.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also examined the 8K mode introduced in The Callisto Protocol with the PS5 Pro patch. This mode is not as impressive as the No Man's Sky 8K mode, as it features a slightly sharper image than the 4K resolution mode and not much else. As such, Digital Foundry theorizes that this mode employs a dynamic resolution range that hits up to 6K and then upscales the image to 8K.</p>
