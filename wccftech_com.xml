			<p>Ninja Theory has announced that Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will arrive on PlayStation 5 sometime this summer.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1925174749317185829"> video posted to the studio's official X account</a>, with studio head Dom Matthews delivering the good news. Matthews doesn't provide a specific release date, only saying that it will arrive sometime this summer, though he did reveal that there will be some new features added to the game with the PS5 release that will also be available on the Xbox and PC versions of the game the same day the PS5 version launches.</p>
<p>"<em>We're so happy to tell you, our fans, that Hellblade 2 will be coming to PlayStation 5 this summer,</em>" Matthews said. "<em>This version of the game will include some new features, which will also be coming to Xbox and PC at the same time as an update</em>."</p>

<p>Ninja Theory might be an Xbox Game Studios developer now, but as Matthews points out in the video, the studio has a rich history with PlayStation. The first Hellblade game launched on PlayStation 4 before coming to Xbox a little less than a year later, and PlayStation veterans will remember that Ninja Theory was the team behind the PlayStation 3 launch title, Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p>"<em>We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation, going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword, and we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans, back to Senua's story,</em>" Matthews continued. "<em>And so the team have been working hard to optimize Hellblade 2 for both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro to give you the very best experience we can, and we look forward to sharing more details with you soon.</em>"</p>
<p>It'll launch on PlayStation under a slightly new title, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Enhanced, and is already available to wishlist on PS5 consoles.</p>
