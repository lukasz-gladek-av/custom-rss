            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative">Windows Central</a>, which has been corroborated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsypjg3yg22e">Bloomberg</a>, the latest casualty from Microsoft's massive 9,000+ employee layoff today is Xbox Game Studios team The Initiative, a team that was founded for the purpose of making a new Perfect Dark game. That Perfect Dark game is now cancelled, and The Initiative has been shuttered.</p>



<p>Windows Central had previously hinted towards this while reporting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG had been cancelled</a>, but has now confirmed the news after obtaining an email from Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. Booty's memo also confirms what had already been reported around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild being cancelled</a>, and adds that "<em>several unannounced projects</em>" have also been cancelled as part of today's layoffs. </p>



<div><p>"<em>Following Phil's note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units</em>," Booty begins, referencing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">an email sent out from Microsoft Gaming chief executive officer, Phil Spencer</a>.</p><p>"<em>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment</em>. <em>Our portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</em></p><p><em>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams. To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead</em>."</p></div>



<p>The cancellation of Perfect Dark also brings an end to the partnership Xbox had with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-being-available-for-perfect-dark-was-too-precious-of-a-resource-to-pass-on-says-xgs-head/">Crystal Dynamics,</a> who was working on the project alongside The Initiative.</p>



<p>Players who grew up with the first Xbox consoles recognize Perfect Dark as one of the series that helped make the Xbox a household name. While the last official Perfect Dark outing failed to impress, the excitement around its reboot could not have been higher for fans. The Initiative was described as a team of industry veterans, all excited to bring back the beloved stealth series. We even got to see some fairly impressive gameplay last year, seemingly indicating that the game was progressing well and that we'd see it on shelves within the next two years.</p>

<p>Now, we'll never know what the final product would have looked like, as the failings of Microsoft's executive branch continue to devastate thousands of people across the video game industry.</p>



<p>While there have already been major cuts confirmed today, more are still inbound. Forza Motorsport studio, Turn10, has<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l"> reportedly lost 50% of its staff,</a> and several Call of Duty studios, including Raven Software, have also suffered layoffs as part of today's cuts. We'll continue to update our stories and report on the cuts as more details are confirmed.</p>

			<p>Three former Ubisoft executives have been given suspended prison sentences in a harassment trial that began in March and was delayed until June. </p>



<p>First reported by French publication <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/07/02/harcelement-chez-ubisoft-trois-anciens-cadres-condamnes-a-des-peines-allant-jusqu-a-trois-ans-de-prison-avec-sursis_6617387_4408996.html">Le Monde</a>, former vice president of editorial and creative services, Thomas François, was found guilty of moral and sexual harassment and attempted sexual assault. He was fined €30,000 and given a three-year suspended prison sentence. </p>



<p>Former chief creative officer at Ubisoft, Serge Hascoët, was accused of making lewd and racist comments and of allegedly harassing a Muslim employee by replacing her desktop background with images of food and placing food on her desk while she was fasting for Ramadan. He was fined €45,000 and received an 18-month suspended prison sentence. </p>



<p>Lastly, former game designer at Ubisoft, Guillame Patrux, was accused of psychological harassment and given a 12-month suspended prison sentence and a €10,000 fine. </p>



<p>Patrux, Hascoët, and François, were all part of the toxic culture Ubisoft had allowed to fester that employees called out in 2021 with an open letter from employees calling for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-workers-support-activision-blizzard-employees/">A Better Ubisoft</a>. While Activision Blizzard employees were calling out the leaders who perpetuated ABK's own toxic culture, Ubisoft employees stood up to support workers at Activision Blizzard King, while also calling out their own studios issues. </p>



<p>A year later, Ubisoft employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-a-better-ubisoft-worker-demands-not-met-25-percent-quit/">called out chief executive officer Yves Guillemot</a> for seemingly not responding to the demands staff had made to improve the company culture, while claiming that he took the issues they had raised<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-acknowledges-employees-letter-promises-new-update-in-q3-employees-claim-their-demands-were-sidelined/"> "<em>seriously</em>."</a></p>



<p>One of the key issues employees raised was that when issues with executives like Hascoët were brought forward, rather than that executive losing their job, they were transferred to another position in Ubisoft's global team. It's worth noting that Hascoët was never officially fired from the company, and instead resigned, reportedly after a conversation was had regarding the allegations against him.</p>
