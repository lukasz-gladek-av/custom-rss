            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20251023_eldenring_tarnishededition_postponement">announced today in a press release</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring, titled Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, will no longer be released in 2025 and has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>A statement from FromSoftware cites the reason for the delay as the game needing more time "<em>for game performance adjustments</em>." A more specific release window beyond 2026 was not provided.</p>



<p>"<em>While development is progressing wholeheartedly towards release</em>," the statement begins, "<em>it was deemed that more time is required for game performance adjustments and the decision to change the release date was made.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Further announcements will follow once a specific release date has been determined. We offer our sincere apologies for inconveniencing players who have been eagerly awaiting the release of this title. Thank you for your patience and support as we continue to make performance adjustments</em>."</p>



<p>Frankly, this delay isn't the biggest surprise. Besides the fact that the quality bar for technical performance in FromSoftware games is rocky at best, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">there were already reasonable concerns</a> with how this new version would run on the Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, it's more powerful than the first Switch and definitely has a shot at running Elden Ring with some degree of stability, but it's no surprise to learn that FromSoftware needs more time to try and figure that out.</p>



<p>And based on their track record, even when it arrives it'll likely do so with its fair share of performance issues anyways. Of course, we hope that's not the case, but FromSoftware can't even put out games on current-gen consoles and PCs without significant performance issues.</p>



<p>Elden Ring also isn't the only major title that won't be hitting its initial 2025 release window on Nintendo Switch 2. Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">recently delayed indefinitely,</a> while Gearbox continues to fix and resolve the performance issues the game had on other platforms and addressing what we can only assume to be serious performance issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, if you want to take Elden Ring with you on the go, the only option remains PC handhelds like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck </a>or the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing significant emulation improvements for several PS4 exclusives.</p>



<p>The new version of the emulator, which can be downloaded from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://shadps4.net/downloads/">its official website</a> by setting the Update Channel to Nightly, brings many current PlayStation 4 exclusives closer to a fully playable state on PC while also booting games that did not launch in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-0-11-0-unreal-engine-games/">previous versions of the emulator</a>, a crucial step for further emulation improvements.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProteinGaming-97">ProteinGaming</a> showcases how games like Ratchet &amp; Clank 2016, God of War III Remastered, The Order: 1886, the P.T. demo, Infamous: Second Son, Uncharted: Nathan Drake Collection, Gravity Rush and others run under the new version of the emulator on a system powered by an i5-12400F CPU, RTX 4060 GPU and 32 GB RAM. </p>



<p>While some games, like The Order 1886, are nowhere near playable, others have seen considerable performance improvements, like God of War III Remastered, Gravity Rush 2, and The Last Guardian. So, it may not be long before these games become fully playable on PC, even without an official port.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While PlayStation 4 games becoming playable on PC would be more than enough for most players who never had the chance to try out these games on the original hardware, improved emulation could also lead to graphics and performance improvements. </p>



<p>Bloodborne, whose emulation was further improved in the new version of the ShadPS4 emulator, not only can be made to run at 60 FPS on PC, its visuals can be enhanced significantly with the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-remaster-project-update/">Remastered Project visual overhaul</a>, which introduces, among other improvements, dynamic shadows and is set to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-remaster-addressing-low-quality-meshes/">get another critical improvement down the line.</a></p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator, an up-to-date compatibility list and more can be found on the emulator's <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/popular-survival-game-enshrouded-launch-update-november-10/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/popular-survival-game-enshrouded-to-launch-%E2%80%98wake-of-the-water%E2%80%99-update-on-november-10.1332718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>German developer Keen Games announced that its popular survival game Enshrouded will receive its largest free content update on November 10.</p>



<p>The update, titled Wake of the Water, introduces dynamic water as well as swimming, a fishing mini-game, watering plants via watering can or irrigation, terraforming, and basebuilding within, around, and under water. Players will find new fish and land-based critters, like Veilwater Snapjaws, crabs, and capybaras. The latter can be tamed for those looking forward to having a capybara chilling at the base.</p>



<p>Wake of the Water introduces many more improvements to Enshrouded, though. The user interface has been reworked, and items have been rebalanced across the whole game. To begin with, weapon stats now match their name and visuals (e.g., Ice Coated Daggers now properly deal ice damage instead of just cut and pierce). Weapon durability has increased and now scales with both level and rarity, improving weapon longevity. That said, existing (pre-update) weapons will retain their current stats, so only new drops after this update will show the improvements.</p>



<p>Numerous new weapons have been added to enemy drops, which now scale with enemy level and range in rarity from common to legendary. Players can also craft any lore weapon previously unlocked, at any game stage and any item level. This lets fans upgrade favorites (like the light-emitting Whailing Blade) as they progress, countering unlucky RNG and supporting all playstyles. Armor, rings, and food items also received stat tweaks, bolstering their relevance and gameplay effectiveness for all classes and builds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Keen Games also fixed the long-time bug where loot chests could be repeatedly looted via server reload. Passive HP, stamina, and mana regeneration have also been adjusted, resulting in decreased regeneration in the mid-to-late game. This change is meant to prevent trivializing combat encounters while encouraging Enshrouded players to plan ahead by preparing potions, eating meals, etc.</p>



<p>The Wake of the Water update introduces some new consumable and decorative items and quality-of-life features: expect new items that provide buffs, ranging from food to decor, along with the ability to label chests and signs.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/">over four million players as part of its player base</a>, the Enshrouded team is slowly but surely getting closer to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned 1.0 launch on PC and consoles in 2026</a>. Will you jump in for this update or wait for the full version?</p>

			<p>If you had to rank the three video game console manufacturers based on how well they're doing commercially in 2025, the answer for numbers one and two could differ from person to person, with some seeing Nintendo as solidly in first, and others seeing PlayStation. But without a doubt, Microsoft and Xbox are in third place, and it's from this position, from well behind its two biggest competitors, that Microsoft and Xbox management are reportedly asking its studios to hit profit margin goals far above the industry average.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok">Bloomberg</a> shows that Microsoft and Xbox are setting <strong>30% profit margin</strong> goals for its internal studios. This isn't for every project, as the report clarifies that "<em>Not every project is expected to hit the 30% profit threshold,</em>" per Bloomberg's sources, "<em>but many Xbox developers and groups have been presented with the new target</em>."</p>



<p>The average profit margins for the rest of the industry have fallen between 17% and 22% since 2018, per the report and analysis from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Neil Barbour, analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, even distinguished 30% or higher margins as the kind of goal you'd set if you were "<em>a publisher that is really nailing it.</em>"</p>







<p>Thanks to court documents we saw as part of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/">closing out its Activision Blizzard acquisition in 2023</a>, we know that just two years ago, the profit margin for Xbox and the gaming division sat at just 12% for most of 2022. Once that merger closed in October 2023, Bloomberg's report claims that Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, implemented the new 30% goal, as if to say that Xbox needed to start making back the money that was spent on making franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush first-party franchises.</p>



<p>Gambles like putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/">haven't necessarily paid off though</a>, or <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">at least that's how it seems</a>, since in the last two years after that 30% profit margin goal was set, Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">laid off thousands</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">employees within its gaming division</a>, closed <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">its own studios</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancelled several highly anticipated projects</a>. </p>



<p>It's worth pointing out that the layoffs aren't entirely due to Xbox Game Studios not hitting the profit margin. We know that while that goal exists, Microsoft has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">investing more into AI</a> and would seemingly close, cut, and sell off any project to free up capital to invest even more. But knowing that the company's leadership is asking its game studios to hit well above the industry average does help to explain how leadership gets to the conclusion that these <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">mass layoffs</a> and publishing its first-party titles on competing platforms are necessary.</p>



<p>Of course, you could argue that Amy Hood and Microsoft are setting the gaming division up to fail, because again, Microsoft is nowhere close to being the industry-leading titan we saw in its Xbox 360 days. The sentiment that Microsoft wants out of the video game business is one that continues to grow online, and if that's the end goal for Microsoft, then its playbook of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">cutting projects from its expert developers</a>, setting unreasonable profit margin goals, and constantly upsetting its consumer base with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">price hikes on products</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">services</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/">pushing features nobody asked for</a> is a solid one.</p>



<p>The report continues to say that the projects likely to get priority within Microsoft and Xbox will be "<em>cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls</em>," which also sounds like we're in for cheaply made games and live service bets that don't try to do anything other than make as much money as possible.</p>



<p>A Microsoft spokesperson quoted in the report adds, "<em>We look at the business as a whole, balancing creativity, innovation, and sustainability across a diverse portfolio of offerings. As with any creative business, sometimes that means making hard decisions and stopping work on things that are no longer working for a variety of reasons, and shifting resources toward the projects that are more aligned with our direction and priorities</em>."</p>
