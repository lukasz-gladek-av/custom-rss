			<p>Embark Studios has finally shared the debut gameplay trailer for ARC Raiders. The game was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021 as a free-to-play cooperative shooter. However, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-the-latest-game-to-be-delayed-to-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> several delays that led Embark to <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-discovery-team-fps-embark-studios-first-game-before-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus</a> on The Finals (formerly known as Project Discovery), their competitive shooter, first.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the developer finally re-<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> ARC Raiders as a third-person PvPvE extraction shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-pc-playtesting-begins-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playtesting</a> took place last month. Today, Executive Producer Aleksander Grøndal said about the playtest:</p>
<p><em>This was a really encouraging playtest for us. We now have lots of data and feedback to sift through. We know that players appreciate the atmosphere of the world we've created and the immersion we bring to the table. We also know there's a lot we can do to continue to optimize and balance the experience. We're keen to deliver on a much expanded late-game experience, with deeper progression and extensive quests that take players across new locations, as well as a larger variety of ARC machines and other world-encounters.</em></p>

<p>In ARC Raiders, players scavenge the surface of the world for vital supplies and materials through quests and raids assigned by the merchants of Speranza. While scavenging the surface, they will encounter enemy ARC machines and other raiders competing for resources.</p>
<p>Engaging in firefights may be the only way out of a tight spot, but it's also risky. Sometimes, being cautious and staying out of sight is a better option to stay alive. To keep the hard-earned loot, players must reach extraction points and risk being ambushed. Success means getting their hands on vital materials for crafting and upgrading, or items to sell to the merchants for currency.</p>
<p>According to the developers, ARC Raiders mixes high-intensity, time-sensitive extraction challenges on the surface with strategic survival elements underground, where progress is closely tied to the player's workshop. Building and upgrading various crafting stations allows users to craft new equipment, such as advanced weapon mods or unique gadgets.</p>
<p>The merchants in Speranza will give quests in exchange for extra currency and experience, as well as the occasional item. The vendors offer different items and equipment, depending on their specialty. Players may also spend experience in a skill tree to customize their playstyle.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders will be released next year on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store, with support for NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>The twenty-year-old MMORPG EVE Online has just received its newest expansion, The Revenant, which introduces powerful ships, weapons, and dens for capsuleers as well as The Deathless for the alliance.</p>
<h2>Revenant expansion adds new content to the iconic space MMO EVE Online, letting capsuleers use new mercenary dens and fearsome deathless ships</h2>
<p>The 21-year-old sci-fi space MMO: EVE Online, developed by CCP Games, has today received the Revenant expansion, bringing new content and enhanced gameplay. The Revenant expansion introduces new powerful ships, mercenary dens, and weapons to battle against enemies but The Deathless adds a new layer of mystery to the game.</p>

<p>The Deathless is seemingly an untrustworthy character who is difficult to trust but can be both a valuable ally and a threat that players must cooperate with as they face the Drifters. The Drifters are a powerful faction that needs to be tackled with the help of Deathless, who will provide powerful ships, weapons, and ammunition in return for encrypted infomorphs.</p>
<p>Bergur Finnbogason, Creative Director for&nbsp;<em>EVE Online says,</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The Deathless…can he be trusted? What are his intentions? An untrustworthy ally is an ally nonetheless, but the clock is ticking. The Drifters will be back,</p></blockquote>
<p>These encrypted infomorphs can be produced using new mercenary dens that are deployed in orbit around temperate planets. The players can form coalitions to protect these dens or raid the enemy structures to disrupt operations in the Nullsec, which is ready to witness massive battles.</p>

<p>EVE Online Players will be provided with powerful Deathless ships in the Revenant expansion that can be used to gain strategic advantage in New Eden's power struggles. These are the <em>Tholos Destroyer&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cenotaph Battlecruiser&nbsp;</em>which specialize in close-range combat. These ships bring the cloaking ability to perform SCARAB breaching pods and striker clone weaponry that can tear through shields, armors, and hulls from the inside, giving the corporations and alliances a high-stakes opportunity to reshape territorial control.</p>

<p>To further increase the impact of corporations, the Revenant expansion brings enhanced corporation projects to set broader goals for members. Plus, a new Ship Insurance project type enables them to offer insurance-backed compensation.</p>

<p>CCP Games is also providing SKINs via 40 new patterns and new nanocoatings for players to experiment with their ships, allowing customizations and letting players make beautiful patterns and unique designs. With customizations, EVE Online players can design exclusive SKINs for their corporations and alliances to represent their identity in both cooperative and competitive contexts.</p>
