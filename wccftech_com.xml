			<p>NVIDIA has confirmed the list of PC games joining the ever-growing GeForce NOW library today. The highlights are Obsidian's sci-fi action RPG The Outer Worlds 2 (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have reviewed here</a>) and Embark's post-apocalyptic third-person extraction shooter game ARC Raiders. Both games support the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-cloud-experience-closer-ever-local/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA RTX Blackwell server upgrade</a>, which means Ultimate subscribers can enable NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to get the highest possible frame rates.</p>

<li>Wreckreation (New release on Steam, Oct. 28)</li>



<li>Outbreak Island (New release on Steam, Oct. 28)</li>

</ul>



<p>Meanwhile, NVIDIA continues to add more RTX 5080-class servers throughout its server regions. The latest one to be enabled is in Sofia, Bulgaria, with Amsterdam and Montréal scheduled to be next.</p>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA announced a limited-time offer to celebrate the launch of ARC Raiders. Every purchase of a new 12-month GeForce NOW Ultimate membership will grant a digital copy of the extraction shooter, starting today and through Thursday, November 20. Just like Embark's previous game, The Finals, ARC Raiders also supports RTXGI to improve the game's global illumination. GeForce NOW users at the Performance and Ultimate tiers can enable the feature in the game's settings.</p>

			<p>The MMORPG AION 2 will launch globally in 2026 with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on the PC version (the game will also be available on mobile devices).</p>



<p>The initial launch in South Korea and Taiwan is set for November 19. The game is a sequel to Aion: The Tower of Eternity, which launched in 2008 in Korea and the following year worldwide. The original game was powered by Crytek's CRYENGINE, whereas this new installment is made with Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>Aion 2 takes place around two hundred years later and features a world that, according to NCSOFT, is 36 times larger. Moreover, unlike the “zoned” areas of the original, Aion 2 features a seamless, fully explorable world with no loading screens between vast regions. Players will once again choose between two factions, Elyos and Asmodian, which are eternally locked in conflict. However, unlike in the original game, they will be placed in separate servers, so the conflict between them will occur entirely in the Abyss. On this special PvP battlefield, the populations of two servers (one for Elyos and another for Asmodian players) will clash.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the developers have promised over 200 dungeons to explore that range from solo instances to group dungeons for up to eight players. Eight are also the classes available at launch: Gladiator, Templar, Assassin, Marksman, Sorcerer, Spiritmaster, Cleric, and Chanter.</p>

<p>The news was shared by NVIDIA as part of a press release highlighting the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/gamer-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce Gamer Festival</a>, which is live today at COEX in Seoul to celebrate 25 years of GeForce in South Korea. The MMORPG is playable at the event, just like NCSOFT's MMOTPS Cinder City, which we checked out at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an exclusive developer interview</a>.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared a brief update by KRAFTON on PUBG Ally, the 'co-playable character' powered by ACE <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at CES 2025</a>. PUBG Ally, which is powered by the small language model (SMM) Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k and enables AI teammates to support the player including even engaging in combat with other players, will host a 'user test event' early next year. </p>

			<p>Xbox gaming revenues have declined by $113 million, or 2%, due to drop in hardware sales and limited growth of gaming content and services in Q1 FY2026 over the prior year, Microsoft confirmed in its latest financial report.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the company reported its<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast"> Q1 FY2026 earnings</a>, confirming the Xbox hardware revenue 29% decline, which is offset in part by growth in Xbox content and services, whose $5.5 billion revenue is a 1% improvement over the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"strong prior year"</em>. This revenue increase was driven by growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content, and partially offset by a decline in first-party content.</p>



<p>Xbox hardware sales declining is hardly surprising, as console sales were already down 22% last quarter. With the current generation almost at the end, increasing prices, and a multiplatform strategy that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">bringing tentpole franchises like Halo to the PlayStation 5</a>, no improvement was to be expected. </p>



<p>Considering the above, it will be very interesting to see how much of a difference the next-generation Xbox will make. The new system will reportedly be <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a very premium experience</a> combining <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">the best of the PC and console worlds</a>, but its popularity could be severely impacted by its price, which is <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">expected to be much higher than the price of the PlayStation 6.</a></p>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>

			<p>Work on Valve's HLX project, rumored to be the highly anticipated Half-Life 3, is continuing with more optimization passes, suggesting that the project's polishing phase is in full swing.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McVicker</a>, who provided correct updates on Valve's project for years before their official announcements, reviewed some of the additions made to the Source 2 engine with the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4522268822998171356">Counter-Strike 2 October 15 update.</a></p>



<p>Unlike past updates, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">introduced new systems and features that aren't in use in any other game powered by the Valve engine</a>, the latest update focuses more on optimization and polishing, introducing an automated process to clean up system resources, changes to the sound simulation and liquid simulation systems, and more. </p>



<p>Though in a smaller number than before, new features likely meant for Half-Life 3 HLX have also been added by the latest Counter-Strike 2 update to the Source 2 engine, such as an expanded damage group system to take into account enemy models other than humanoid, and an asynchronous particle simulation system which will compute particles interfacing with simulated wind speed, allowing wind speed to adjust how the particles react on a case-by-case basis as well.</p>



<p>The most notable addition, and the one that is sparking the most discussion in the community, is the introduction of a new icon that denotes a new group of assets labeled as <em>"science"</em>. Tyler McVicker speculates that this doesn't mean much for Half-Life 3 HLX, as, from every update seen to date, the game is clearly in a polishing phase where no assets are being added. Though this usually is the final development phase, Valve could take years to complete it, so there's no indication the game is any close to release.</p>



<p>However, something could be brewing, and the game's release could not be too far in the future. According to rumors, a trailer for Half-Life 3 HLX is being worked on, and if how Valve handled Half-Life Alyx marketing and release is any indication, the game should be launching shortly after its announcement. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Tyler McVicker speculates that something related to Half-Life 3 HLX can happen in November, we have to take any potential reveal date with a massive grain of salt, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">previous reveal windows ended up not being correct</a>. As of now, only one thing seems to be almost for sure: the Half-Life series is far from being done.</p>
