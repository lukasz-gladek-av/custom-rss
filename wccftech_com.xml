			<p>Mike Ybarra, the current chief executive officer of daily fantasy sports betting app <a href="https://www.prizepicks.com/">PrizePicks</a>, who you're more likely to recognize as the former president of Blizzard Entertainment, has some thoughts about <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> taking on <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> this fall, predicting that EA's shooter will "<em>boot stomp</em>" the latest entry in the annual series that helps keep his former company afloat, and that FPS fans will be better off for it.</p>



<p>"<em>Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year</em>," his post on X (formerly Twitter) reads. "<em>But the real win here is CoD won't be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953622553894785366">Replying</a> to someone commenting on his post, Ybarra expanded on his thoughts and criticism of the Call of Duty series dating back to 2016, saying, "<em>CoD has gone downhill for years since then</em>. <em>It's a mess. Cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors. People are sick of it. Luckily BF will force them to change it</em>."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1954586377036628253">another repl<strong>y</strong></a> to someone accusing him of being "<em>bitter</em>," Ybarra writes, "<em>CoD will get better because BF will be</em> <em>great. You're blind if you don't see that. Bitter? No, glad I'm not part of the end of Xbox. Upset they can't lead teams to make good games? Yes. Because they layoff all those people for leaderships mishaps.</em>"</p>



<p>Strong words from someone who was at the top end of company leadership at Blizzard for a few years, and who also worked at Microsoft for almost two decades before that. Ybarra left Blizzard and subsequently Microsoft in 2024, alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">massive 1,900-employee layoff at Activision Blizzard King</a> that came shortly after Microsoft officially closed on its acquisition of ABK.</p>



<p>Between his time at Microsoft, then Blizzard, and then Microsoft again, Ybarra was on the leadership end of his fair share of mishaps that resulted in layoffs. That's not to say they were all directly his own mishaps, but it feels odd, to say the least, to hear him generalize leadership in this way, as if we're meant to think he wasn't around for any of the bad stuff at Blizzard and Microsoft.</p>



<p>All that said, he has a point that an incredible Battlefield game that gives Call of Duty some serious competition in the shooter market can only make Activision and the Call of Duty team work harder to beat Battlefield the next year, and the same goes for Battlefield Studios working to get the better of Call of Duty. </p>



<p>Healthy competition in the market means better games for players, but for that to happen, Battlefield 6 has to stick the landing when it arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025.</p>



<p>At least it's had a strong start, since, on Steam, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">surpassed</a> the record concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">Call of Duty</a> in just its first open beta.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, Embark Studios, the team behind popular free-to-play FPS The Finals, was heavily showcasing its upcoming third-person extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, with a large-scale public playtest this past April, followed by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/">major release date trailer</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, we've not seen anything more of the game, and Embark Studios has just confirmed that we'll continue to see nothing until we're much closer to its October 30th launch date. In a statement published to the game's official X account, Embark Studios has confirmed the team is in a heads-down state leading up to launch.</p>



<p>There won't be another public playtest for the game before launch, and Embark won't be featuring the game at Gamescom 2025, which is a little more than a week away at the time of this writing. </p>



<p>"<em>Our focus is now on polishing and expanding the experience, and putting all the learnings from TT2 into action ahead of release</em>," the statement reads. "<em>Just so you know, we're not planning additional public tests before launch. We've learned from our last announcement that it's crucial to keep expectations in check, so we also want to be clear that we won't be at Gamescom. But don't worry, our launch campaign will kick off before you know it!"</em></p>



<p>"<em>We'll have many more updates for you in the lead-up to launch. Thank you for all the support and encouragement you've been sending our way! It means the world</em>."</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got to check out ARC Raiders earlier this year</a>, and in his preview noted it as a "<em>promising</em>" title, though of course there's only so much that can be gleamed from public playtests ahead of launch. That said, Alessio marked that "<em>Embark seems to have mixed in enough familiar and new elements to create an exciting recipe.</em>"</p>

			<p>The price of the PlayStation 5 in the United States promises to remain stable for the immediate future, as Sony has already taken measures to limit the impact of tariffs.</p>



<p>During the Q1 2026 Earnings Call a couple of days ago, as transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810238-sony-group-corporation-sony-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed the company is diversifying their supply chain, and production has already been transfered outside China for units to be sold in the United States to limit the impact of the tariffs. Regarding peripherals, the shift is still ongoing and will be completed by the end of the first half of the fiscal year. Regarding the company's pricing strategy for consoles, the Sony CFO couldn't make a definitive statement, as factors like annual profit, lifetime value, sell-in volume and expected content sales will be considered, as well as how consumers react to prices. As such, the strategy remains flexible.</p>



<p>The current worldwide economic situation is making it challenging for console manufacturers to keep prices down. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">April</a>, the price of the PlayStation 5 was increased in Europe, the UK, and Australia, and although it hasn't in the United States, there's no certainty it will at some point, judging from the statement above. Nintendo, however, did not manage to keep the price of its previous generation system, as the Japanese company has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">increased</a> the price of all of the original Nintendo Switch models in the US, with price increases ranging from $30 to $50.</p>



<p>Economic uncertainty is definitely influencing how the next console generation will shape up. According to leaks, Sony is designing the PlayStation 6 to deliver a 4K, 120 FPS experience while keeping costs down, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">a proposition that would be enticing at any price below $900</a>, according to a former AMD employee.</p>
