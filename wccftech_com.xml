			<p>Koei Tecmo has announced that Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian will launch on PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, on&nbsp;<strong>September 26, 2025</strong>. It will also release on PS4, though the PS4 release will only be made available in Japan.</p>
<p>A new 'first look' into the game from Koei Tecmo debuts the first new trailer for the game since it was first announced last year, digging into the new characters introduced in Atelier Resleriana, and a first look at some gameplay.</p>
<p>The story of Atelier Resleriana follows two protagonists on the continent of Lantarna, Rias Eidreise and Slade Clauslyter, who are charged with figuring out why citizens of Hallfein have disappeared, while simultaneously trying to restore their own hometown.</p>

<p>This release will be the second game in the Atelier series to come out in 2025, after Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land came out on consoles and PC this past March.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-make-aladiss-great-again/">In his review, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wrote</a>, "<em>Sometimes too over-simplified, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land charts a new path for the series as they try to draw in new players that might have found the mandatory crafting and time limits of earlier Atelier titles too daunting.</em>"</p>
<p>We'll see in September if this latest entry into the series will continue that trend, and if Koei Tecmo and developer Gust have been able to find a new balance between keeping things simple for new players while also complex enough for veteran players to dig into the minutiae of the game's systems.</p>

			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation</a>, the company confirmed that as of March 31, 2025, for the first time in this console generation, PS5 monthly active users have surpassed PS4 monthly active users, which means that more players on PlayStation are finally starting to make the transition to the current generation of hardware.</p>
<p>Just last year, when Sony gave this presentation in May 2024, Sony confirmed that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-of-all-playstation-gamers-are-yet-to-upgrade-to-ps5-sony-stats-reveal">split between PS5 and PS4 players was still 50/50</a>. For one reason or another, four years into the PS4 generation, players were not leaving their old consoles behind. In the past year though, that's changed.</p>
<p>While Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino was speaking, the presentation featured this slide, showing that PS5 players are taking up the majority of PlayStation's 124 million monthly active users.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's also worth noting that the new 124 million active users figure is an increase from the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-registers-new-123-million-monthly-active-users-record-in-december-2023/">123 million active users PlayStation saw in 2023</a>, which was already a record-setting figure for Sony.</p>
<p>"<em>Our platform is stronger than ever</em>," said Nishino. "<em>We continue to attract more players, and we now have over 124M monthly active users. Through the wide range of content and services we provide, these players are more engaged than ever, which has resulted in record-high gameplay hours. Our platform is also more accessible than ever. The PlayStation 5 offers the best way for players to experience our content, and as such, this player base has continued to grow</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These players are highly engaged, spending more on the content and services than in prior generations,</em>" Nishino continued. "<em>However, the PlayStation 4 remains an important access point for existing players to experience our content and services, and we remain committed to serving them</em>."</p>
<p>During the lead-up to the PlayStation 5's launch, there was plenty of talk about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-jim-ryan-its-time-to-give-fans-something-that-can-only-be-enjoyed-on-playstation-5">PlayStation believing in generations</a>, only for the company to confirm that most of its big titles coming to PS5 would also be coming to PS4. It's clear that things have changed at this point, with the PS4 still being a big chunk of PlayStation's player base.</p>
<p>In the same annual presentation, PlayStation even confirmed that it is committed to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-committed-to-exploring-a-new-and-enhanced-way-to-engage-with-content-and-services-multiplatform-strategy-set-to-remain-the-same-for-the-foreseeable-future/">multiplatform strategy going into the next generation</a>.</p>
