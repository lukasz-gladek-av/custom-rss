			<p>The final triple-A game release of the year, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, was just released. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed the game for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but the game is also available for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Indeed, as you might remember, it was initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the previous Switch during Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight, just a few months after that console's debut. It famously had a troubled development phase, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-indeed-developed-bandai-namco-according-multiple-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had originally picked Bandai Namco</a> instead of Retro Studios to make the game. </p>



<p>The project wasn't going well, which led to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being rebooted and handed back to Retro Studios</a>, resulting in an inevitable significant delay. Even though the Austin-based studio eventually launched the game well after the debut of the Switch 2, Nintendo still kept its promise to release the game on the original Switch, too.</p>



<p>That's great news even for PC gamers because, while there are no Switch 2 emulators yet, there are plenty of Switch emulators. Sure, Nintendo cracked down hard on the scene and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced the closure of Yuzu</a> (and its fork<span>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/suyu-yuzus-emulator-fork-gets-taken-down-just-hours-after-the-first-build-release/" target="_blank">Suzu</a>), but many alternatives are still active, including <a href="https://ryujinx.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryubing</a>, an open-source fork based on</span> the historic Ryujinx emulator, as well as newer emulators like <a href="https://eden-emu.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eden</a> and <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citron</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metroid prime 4: Beyond - Eden vs Citron" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxSycDP8e3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All of these are running Metroid Prime 4 well, as you can see from the embedded video. But the real kicker is that with ReShade, it's even possible to render the game (and other Switch titles) in stereoscopic 3D and play it on a giant screen through the <a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtual Desktop software</a>. To begin, you will need to <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download ReShade</a> 6.6.2 with full add‑on support and the Rendepth shader to convert the game’s depth buffer into a side‑by‑side 3D image that Virtual Desktop can interpret as stereoscopic video.</p>



<p>After installing ReShade (select the Vulkan option), enable the Rendepth shader and set the output to side-by-side with stereo strength at 100%, Z-buffer scaling at around 30, and parallax/overlap adjusted to your preference. To verify that depth is being captured correctly, ensure that the Show depth buffer setting is toggled on and use the AdjustDepth/DisplayDepth add-on to cycle through Vulkan depth sources until the buffer displays a proper gradient from black to white, rather than a flat white image.</p>



<p>If the depth preview is inverted, upside‑down, or flat, simply edit ReShade's global preprocessor definitions, toggling flags such as “depth input is reversed” or “depth input is upside down” from 0 to 1, until the depth image looks correct. Once the right Vulkan depth source is selected (it'll be the one with the most vertices) and the image is oriented correctly, disable the debug view, enable performance mode, and keep Rendepth active to generate the 3D image in normal gameplay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Using Rendepth and ReShade to play stereoscopic 3D Metroid Prime 4 and Switch games." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoCFGIvgiA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Now, in Virtual Desktop, set the 3D mode to half side‑by‑side or over‑under so that the double image from Rendepth fuses into a stereoscopic view on the virtual big screen. The creator of the video, lionellion, describes the result as a “Nintendo 3DS pop‑out” visor effect with a presentation akin to having a giant curved screen in front of you. Of course, to replicate this effect, you will need a Virtual Reality/XR headset or glasses or a glassless 3D display <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-2d-3d-gaming-monitor-concept-supports-glassless-3d-and-vr-gaming-wins-ces-2024-innovation-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like this one</a>. </p>



<p>Needless to say, playing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on PC can only be legally done if you purchased an original copy for the Nintendo Switch and then dumped it for your own use. </p>

<p>Where Winds Meet immediately caught our attention when Everstone Studio, a new internal NetEase development studio based in Hangzhou and specifically created to develop this game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-is-a-wuxia-open-world-sandbox-rpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its first trailer at Gamescom 2022</a>. We were the first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publish an exclusive interview with the development team</a> just around a month later, where we learned various details, including the studio's revelation on the title choice: they envisioned wind as a symbol of freedom, and with multiple winds gathering, it is akin to a meeting of people with different ideas. Exploration and freedom, civilization and harmony are the themes behind Where Winds Meet's original concept.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Everstone Studio tested Where Winds Meet extensively before its launch. The first Closed Beta Test <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuxia-open-world-game-where-winds-meet-starts-first-closed-beta-test-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took place in April 2024</a>; a month later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the game would be released on PlayStation 5 in addition to the previosly announced PC version. The game was launched in China in December 2024. </p>



<p>Everstone conducted two additional testing rounds this year in <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-new-cbt-set-for-may-16-19-on-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July</a>, followed by the final global release <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14, 2025</a>. The game is available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, as well as on PlayStation 5 as a timed console exclusive. A mobile version <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is scheduled to follow on December 12, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>The title employs a free‑to‑play business model with cross‑progression between supported platforms. Monetization revolves around cosmetics, battle‑pass style rewards, and gacha systems for visual items, with both the developer and the publisher emphasizing that there are no pay‑to‑win stat advantages attached to paid content.</p>



<h2 id="genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Where Winds Meet positions itself between <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Tsushima</a>‑style prestige action‑adventure and a more systemic game, describing its core as an “open‑world wuxia ARPG” with strong narrative, social, and multiplayer layers. Wuxia here means gravity‑defying martial arts, chivalric codes, and tangled sect politics, with Everstone leaning into romanticized Jianghu folklore rather than strict historical simulation.​</p>



<p>The story unfolds in China during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, a chaotic 10th-century interregnum between the Tang and Song dynasties marked by short‑lived regimes and constant warfare. Cities like Kaifeng serve as political and economic hubs, while borderlands, bamboo forests, deserts, and mountain monasteries highlight the fractures between imperial authority and the martial underworld. The protagonist is a nameless swordsman (or swordswoman) with a hidden past, drawn into conspiracies involving rival kingdoms, ancient martial sects, and supernatural‑tinged relics. The player character can join one of eleven sects (or remain sectless and 'steal' specific martial skills without joining), each with a unique philosophy, rules, signature martial arts and/or features. Here's the list of the sects:</p>



<ul>
<li>Well of Heaven</li>



<li>Silver Needle</li>



<li>Midnight Blades</li>



<li>Nine Mortal Ways</li>



<li>Velvet Shade</li>



<li>Raging Tides</li>



<li>The Masked Troupe</li>



<li>Lone Cloud</li>



<li>Hollow Vale</li>



<li>Inkbound Order</li>



<li>Mohist Hill</li>
</ul>



<p>The developers stressed that the narrative is not purely linear: branching dialogue, optional “Lost Chapter” storylines, and faction questlines can reframe how key conflicts are resolved and which NPCs become allies or enemies. Jianghu reputation systems track how different sects and regions perceive the player, unlocking unique skills, outfits, or story beats if you side with, infiltrate, or betray particular groups.​</p>



<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The game's core combat combines Souls-style commitment with character-action spectacle, albeit leaning more toward the latter. Players can lock onto targets, manage stamina‑like resources, and use a universal guard/parry system that can deflect most strikes if timed well. Once enemies are staggered, the game encourages launching them into juggles, air‑dashes, and cinematic finishers. Accessibility options include auto-parry, auto-dodge, and timing assists, allowing less technical players to enjoy the wuxia spectacle. On the other hand, action genre fans will want to keep these assists disabled to enjoy a more challenging reaction-based experience.​</p>



<p>In Where Winds Meet, weapons define broad playstyles rather than rigid classes. For example, straight swords favor precise counters and ripostes; spears grant reach and crowd control; dual blades focus on aggressive, stance‑dancing DPS; bows and crossbows support ranged pressure; and umbrellas, fans, or Taichi techniques introduce hybrid defensive or support options. Skill trees and “Inner Power” cultivation allow you to slot martial arts manuals and passive meridian bonuses, encouraging experimentation across weapon types and sect styles instead of locking into a single build.​</p>



<p>Traversal is designed to sell the fantasy of a roaming wuxia hero. Players can triple‑jump, sprint up walls, dash across water for short distances, and glide using cloaks or swords, with many side activities—hidden shrines, vista points, legendary beasts—placed in hard‑to‑reach locations to reward mastery of movement. Mounts, boats, and fast‑travel nodes support large‑scale exploration, while “free interaction” systems let you play instruments, practice calligraphy, or interact with wildlife and villagers, adding low‑intensity downtime between major fights.​ There are indeed a lot of 'life skills' or secondary activities, such as being a healer or a scholar, cooking, fishing, and various mini-games and events.</p>



<p>Structurally, Where Winds Meet occupies a rather unique middle ground between solo RPG and MMO. Main and side quests can be completed alone, but world events, boss hunts, sect wars, and competitive arenas encourage grouping with other players in shared hubs and open zones. Seasonal updates are planned to add new regions, sects, and storylines. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">framed the game as a 'living world' title</a> with a long-term live service plan, where Jianghu politics, world bosses, and social features evolve over time without abandoning the strong core narrative available to solo-focused players.​ </p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Where Winds Meet is powered by NetEase's in-house Messiah engine. The game shows modern graphics features such as detailed vegetation, reflective water and surfaces, dynamic lighting, and cinematic, polished martial‑arts animations. </p>



<p>On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-fe-arc-raiders-giveaway-free-new-dlss-rtx-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports NVIDIA DLSS 4/DLAA/Reflex with Super Resolution</a>, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation options available on GeForce RTX graphics cards, where the game can be boosted by up to 3.9x at 4K, reaching up to 500 frames per second on the most powerful graphics cards available on the market, the GeForce RTX 5090.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet also supports AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XeSS 2, as well as FSR Frame Generation. However, the latter is not compatible with the XeSS upscaling option or with High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays, which are otherwise supported.</p>



<p>Below you can find the game's official system requirements. If you don't meet the requirements, the game can also be played through the cloud, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-where-winds-meet-possessors-nvidia-geforce-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 version of Where Winds Meet targets 60 frames per second (though it often drops to 40 or even 30FPS in busy scenes) with an internal resolution well below 4K that is then reconstructed. The PS5 Pro version offers users equipped with the more expensive console two options: a higher-resolution standard mode and a ray traced mode that adds RT reflections. The frame rate remains highly variable in both cases.</p>



<p>Both the PS5 and PC versions support the DualSense controller's adaptive triggers feature.</p>
