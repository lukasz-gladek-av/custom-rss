			<p>Back in December 2025, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/"><strong>CES 2026</strong> really kicked off</a>, ASUS invited Wccftech and other members of the press to downtown Toronto for a sneak preview at what ASUS would be bringing to the coming show in Las Vegas. It was an afternoon packed with information and a look at ASUS's lineup of 2026 products, and as you might imagine, there were more than a few intriguing devices shown off.</p>



<p>That said, everything that was in the showroom that day and all of the tech that is currently descending on Las Vegas comes with a cloud hanging over it: <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/"><strong>memory shortages</strong></a>. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/">shortage is threatening</a> (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">in some ways, already succeeding</a>) to send the entire tech world into disarray, which honestly makes it difficult to get excited about anything coming from ASUS or any other tech hardware manufacturer.</p>



<p>Even with the gloomy realities of the world creeping around every new device that was shown off, I was still able to find a few items that stood out to me as what to look forward to, and what might actually be worth saving up for, if you're in the market for some of the latest and greatest tech.</p>



<p>I also got the chance to speak with <strong>Sascha Krohn, </strong>global director of technical marketing at ASUS, about the company's 2026 lineup and what it's bringing to CES. <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">You can check out that interview here</a>.</p>



<p>Some housekeeping, these picks are just what stood out to me based on their specs, what actually seems exciting about the device, and how I'd be interested in using it. I only got to spend an afternoon getting up close and personal with these devices, and I'm not at CES 2026 personally, so these won't be hands-on impressions. We're sure to learn more about these devices as CES 2026 kicks off, so <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/">check out our full coverage of the showcase here for more</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rog-g1000-the-outrageous">ROG G1000 - The Outrageous</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-G1000-ASUS-CES-2026-Preview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The ROG G1000 at the ASUS CES 2026 Toronto Preview.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are always a few products that make their way to CES that aren't ever going to make it to consumers, and are just expensive showpieces for the show floor. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-g1000-flagship-rog-gaming-desktop-anime-holo-holographic-fans-420mm-aio/"><strong>ASUS ROG G1000</strong></a> straddles the line between a product that's actually going to be available to consumers and something that is better suited as a showpiece for CES.</p>



<p>It's that duality that makes it an impressive machine that can be easy to get excited for, with holographic fans and three-zone cooling. The fact that the chassis is so big, you can fit practically any component you want in there, not to mention ASUS's mandate that only the top-of-the-line hardware gets anywhere close to meeting this tower's standards.</p>



<p>After all, what else would you expect from the flagship ROG desktop in ASUS's 2026 lineup? But unless you have the storage space and, more importantly, the wallet space, the G1000 might as well be one of those impossible products you see at CES that you know you'd never actually get to try unless you were on the show floor. </p>



<p>It's cool and exciting to have a holographic fan and to see an LED show on steroids going on in your PC at all times, but with the price of all tech products in fluctuation, the G1000 may live up to its "<em>Built to be Seen</em>" tagline more than ASUS would like, as all we can do is 'see' it through our own computer screens without a hope of actually getting to see one at our desks while playing the latest release at max settings.</p>

<h2 id="h-rog-zephyrus-g16-the-respectable">ROG Zephyrus G16 - The Respectable</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-Zephyrus-G16-ASUS-CES-2026-Preview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ROG Zephyrus G16 2026 at the ASUS CES 2026 Toronto preview.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This entry comes with a fair share of bias, because I bought an ROG Zephyrus G15 laptop back in 2021, and it's been an incredible piece of kit for me since day one. It's easy for me to get excited about the ROG Zephyrus G16 because it's a better version of a laptop I already love, so take my recommendation of it with that in mind.</p>



<p>As someone who has been working and gaming on an older model in the Zephyrus line of laptops, what stands out to me about the 2026 G16 is how ASUS redesigned the cooling structure for the device, as I've found my current model to run hotter than I'd like while gaming. That's a personal highlight based on my own experience with my older laptop, but the undeniable highlight of the 2026 G16 model is its Nebula HDR OLED display panel.</p>



<p>At 2560x1600 and 240Hz, and up to 1000 Nits, this will undoubtedly be one of the best displays on a laptop this year. It'll be so crisp it might actually distract you long enough that you forget about the memory shortages for a few fleeting moments.</p>

<h2 id="h-rog-zephyrus-duo-the-innovative">ROG Zephyrus Duo - The Innovative</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-2026-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I know devices like the Zephyrus Duo and Zenbook Duo aren't anything brand new. It's not exactly innovative to be putting out yet another version of a device we've already seen before. But to me, if the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-g16-g14-laptops-next-gen-intel-amd-upgrades-dual-3k-oled-stunning-designs/">ROG Zephyrus Duo 2026</a></strong> ended up becoming the best dual-screen laptop so far, that would be innovative enough, because I truly believe dual-screen laptops are the future of laptops overall.</p>



<p>I don't think we'll be abandoning the kinds of laptops we've all been used to for decades, but I do see Duo laptops becoming the 'everything device' for the next generation. It's a tablet when you want it to be, without losing any of the features you get from a full laptop. You can fold it any which way you need whether you're relaxing by watching something online or if you're making a presentation to a group of people. </p>



<p>It's got two standout Nebula HDR OLED displays, all the ports you'd want with little need for any adaptor dongles, and it's got power to spare, especially if you get the model that is spec'd out below with an RTX 5090 and Intel's latest Panther Lake CPUs.</p>



<p>I don't necessarily need a new laptop, but if I did, the Zephryus Duo is what I would try to save my pennies for.</p>

<h2 id="h-rog-flow-z13-kojima-productions-the-cool">ROG Flow Z13 Kojima Productions - The Cool</h2>

<p>Lastly, the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 Kojima Productions collaboration stood out because it is just plain cool. Yes, it is last year's ROG Flow Z13; the hardware inside isn't anything new, but even with that in mind, it's tough to say 'no' to a laptop designed by Yoji Shinkawa and Hideo Kojima. </p>



<p>The hardware won't take you as far as even some of ASUS's more budget-friendly laptops from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-zenbook-a16-fastest-qualcomms-snapdragon-x2-laptop-proart-pz14-zenbook-a14-vivobook-s16-unveiled/">Vivobook</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-amd-ryzen-ai-max-ryzen-ai-400-mainstream-tuf-gaming-a14-laptops/">TUF Gaming </a>lines will, but those don't come with Yoji Shinkawa's brush stroke.</p>

			<p>The air at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/">CES 2026</a></strong> is sure to feel a lot different from that in previous years. <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-sparks-backlash-after-firing-hundreds-of-ai-workers-amid-disputes-over-poor-pay-stressful-work-and-labor-rights/">Not just because of mass layoffs</a>, or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/satya-nadella-admits-transition-into-the-ai-era-could-be-messy-but-does-not-want-microsoft-to-be-left-behind-in-the-tech-race/">continued GenAI/AI push</a> from nearly every major tech company. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wd_black-sn850x-8tb-ssd-heatsink-version-14-percent-off-on-amazon-available-for-829-99/">The memory shortage looms over everything</a>, and its impact will continue to be felt worldwide, with prices likely to rise on all the products showcased in Las Vegas this year. It was pretty much all I could think about back on December 9, 2025, when ASUS invited Wccftech and other members of the media to a preview of what the company would be showing at CES 2026 in downtown Toronto.</p>



<p>There was a lot I got to see that day, and a few things that stood out. If you want to see what those were, <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ces-2026-preview-the-outrageous-the-respectable-and-the-innovative/">you can check out my highlights round-up here</a>.</p>



<p>It was intriguing to see what ASUS was putting forward for the new year, but it was difficult to look at anything with a significant level of excitement. With the way prices are going, when buying anything from the latest 2026 lineup of tech products, you're either getting burned by overpaying now at launch, or you're burned even more by overpaying later if the shortage issues don't improve soon. Pricing was such a significant factor that when I got the chance to sit down and talk with Sascha Krohn, global director of technical marketing at ASUS, it was the first thing I wanted to address.</p>



<p>This was the second time this year I got to speak with Mr. Krohn, after first meeting him in October ahead of the launch for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">You can check out that conversation if you like here</a>, and while we did get to the new handheld, and other elements of ASUS's CES 2026 lineup, the company's AI messaging, and more, we began with what was, and what continues to be the topic of the day.</p>



<p><em>Author's Note: This interview was conducted <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-announces-price-hikes-for-certain-product-combinations-starting-5th-january-2026/">before ASUS announced it would be raising the prices on certain products,</a> which is perhaps why Krohn answers the way he does when asked if ASUS will raise prices soon.</em></p>



<p><strong>We're hearing a lot about memory shortages lately. How much is this affecting ASUS on the manufacturing side, and are there certain products where you're feeling the pressure more than others?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sascha Krohn</strong>: <em>Yeah, I don't actually have any detailed insights into how we deal with our suppliers and how we allocate memory, but basically the way it happens is when you plan out a new product, whether it's a laptop or a handheld, you do have a forecast for how many you think you're going to sell over the lifetime of this product and how much per month, and then you do deals with suppliers. 'I'm going to need this many panels in this month and this month and this quarter,' and so on, and you kind of come to an agreement and make a deal about how much memory, how many panels you're going to buy.</em></p>



<p><em>So to some degree, that helps to shield vendors from sudden changes in prices for components, but there's always wiggle room, right? You never know exactly how many you're going to sell, and you usually make like a deal for a certain quantity, but you're probably going to need more, and then you just buy it, make additional deals later. I'm not really an expert in this, so I don't want to go into too much detail, but I do know that we usually make these kinds of plans ahead of time, which kind of shields us to some degree, but yeah, it is going to affect us for sure. And I know that some of our competitors have already announced that they're increasing prices.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-Zephyrus-DUO-2026-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><em>I believe everybody's going to have to increase prices</em></strong>.<em> I think everything that has memory chips in it and flash memory chips in it is going to go up in price to some degree. How much is going to vary, but everything is going to increase in price, like consoles, phones, tablets. I think that's just inevitable, and I think most people haven't realized it because we all saw the news that memory chips went up in price, but then you see, 'oh, but there's still really good deals on laptops and gaming consoles and everything, and it hasn't really changed all that much.' That's because it takes several months until that shockwave travels through the supply chain and hits all the manufacturers and hits all the retailers and e-tailers. So that is probably still going to happen.</em></p>



<p><em>So yeah, I think it's going to affect everyone, but most companies are not talking about it for obvious reasons. I'm actually surprised that some of our competitors went out and announced it. I don't know why they did that.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is ASUS going to announce price increases soon? Are you expecting price changes on GPUs, laptops, or any of your product line?</strong></p>



<p><em>I haven't heard anything about this internally, so that would be something that would be, like, an official statement that travels through the company, and then we hear about it, and then we communicate it. I haven't heard anything about that, but me personally, yes, I do expect that to happen.</em></p>

<p><strong>Have you been given a potential warning from other companies like NVIDIA that prices are going to go up for products that you collaborate on?</strong></p>



<p><em>I haven't heard anything about that, but if that happened, it would not be something that I would hear about right away, so, yeah, I haven't heard anything about that.</em></p>



<p><strong>Okay, but prices will be rising across the board?</strong></p>



<p><em>That's what I personally think. That's not, like, an official company statement, but me personally, yes, based on my experience, you know, in the tech industry and based on what's happening right now, that's what I assume, yeah.</em></p>



<p><strong>Do you think prices will stabilize soon? How long do you think it will take for them to stabilize?</strong></p>



<p><em>I've been telling all my friends all the really good deals that happened lately for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, that's probably the best deals that they'll be able to get for a while. I don't know how long it's going to take. Like, I'm not an expert in this kind of stuff, but I do think it's going to take a while until prices stabilize overall.</em></p>



<p><em>I mean, just like geopolitics, right? The world is overall, you know, going in a certain direction, and, yeah, I expect that prices are going to at least stay elevated.</em></p>



<p><strong>What's 'a while?'</strong></p>



<p><em>I really don't know. I mean, I could only guess, and I don't want to get into trouble for guessing something.</em></p>



<p><strong>How has the launch of the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X been? Are you meeting expectations sales-wise, and can you share a global estimate of how many units of the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X have been sold?</strong></p>

<p><em>That's an easy question for me because I don't have sales figures, so I don't know. But I can tell you that the reception has been overwhelmingly positive. People really love the ROG Xbox Ally X in particular, which I expected, and I'm not surprised about it at all. I actually think it was a really good and still is a really good price.</em></p>



<p><em>And I think the ROG Xbox Ally X even sold out in a couple of places, yeah? The demand for the ROG Xbox Ally X is much higher than we as a company anticipated. I personally, from the beginning, was like, this one is going to sell really well because there are a lot of people from the original Ally X who want to upgrade, and they're going to upgrade to the ROG Xbox Ally X.</em></p>



<p><strong>I wanted to ask about this tagline here, 'AI: Always Incredible.' What made you land on this for your new line of AI products?</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ASUS-Always-Incredible.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Well, 'Incredible' is kind of like a word that our top management likes to use and we've used a lot over the years. We picked that because it's, you know, together, when you use the two letters, it's AI, always incredible. And that's kind of like our strategy for AI. We want to get to the point that no matter what you're doing, whether it's on device or cloud or on the edge, like in between, you have a great AI experience no matter what you're doing.</em></p>



<p><em>And we want to make it as seamless and as convenient as possible. The ultimate goal is very much like our Zen book. The idea is that technology just gets out of the way.</em> <em>There are a lot of concerns about AI and some people are really worried about AI and don't like AI. </em></p>



<p><em>And there's a lot of annoying stuff that is related to AI, but we also see it as a great enabler to make that happen, right? To get technology out of the way. Like this whole thing, I think there's this saying that magic is technology that you don't even notice that you're interacting with</em>,<em> or something like that, you know? And that's kind of, it feels like magic.</em></p>



<p><em>When technology works the way it should, it feels like magic. It just works, and it's seamless. You don't have to think about it, and you don't have to figure out how to do it. You don't have to learn how to tell your technology what you want, but your technology figures out what you want and does what you want. And AI has the biggest potential to make that a reality for a lot of cool features. So we are very excited about that as a company, and we're leaning very heavily into that, into trying to work on as many AI solutions as possible and use AI to make everything as seamless as possible.</em></p>



<p><strong>What do you think people should be taking away from the 2026 lineup of ASUS products? What is the best thing that ASUS is bringing to the market this year?</strong></p>



<p><em>Oof, only one? I would say the ZenBook Duo. I think the ZenBook Duo 2026. I would pick the ZenBook Duo 2026 because it's so refined, it's so much better than the ZenBook Duo 2025, which is an awesome laptop and we're still gonna sell it throughout the whole year. But the 2026 is so much more refined, lighter, longer battery life, more performance, better displays. It's so much easier to set up.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Shot_019_Zenbook_DUO_Theme_Photo_AC_101-group-1-kopie_72dpi-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>You have the two displays so close to each other now. Yeah, I think that's very refined, and it's also very ASUS. I'm a big fan of the ZenBook Duo because I think for us as a company, what separates us from other brands is that we don't have such a big risk aversion.</em></p>



<p><em>We're willing to try out things even if there's a high chance that it's not going to work out. And ZenBook Duo is a perfect example. Every once in a while, or there's a pretty big number, a pretty high percentage, it does work out, and we end up with something really cool, and then we keep refining it, and it ends up being this really unique product, and there's nothing else like it on the market.</em></p>



<p><em>And we kind of created the Duo segment, and we own that segment, and there are other companies trying to enter that segment, and they're failing; it doesn't really work. So I think, yeah, the ZenBook Duo 2026 is like a perfect example of ASUS doing new things, being innovative, refining things and listening to customer feedback and creating products that people want that are maybe not for everyone but there are a lot of people who really want a product like this and they benefit from a product like this and most companies wouldn't do it because it's not something that everybody's going to buy. You're not going to sell the highest number of devices.</em></p>



<p><em>It's not going to be a device like that. So if you only care about profits and you only care about market share, this is not necessarily something you do, but it's something that ASUS does, and I think, yeah, ZenBook Duo 2026.</em></p>



<p><strong>I would definitely agree that there are more than a few products ASUS make that are not things that everyone would do. The G1000, I think, falls into that same category. I heard outside that you can't buy the chassis separately and then build your own PC inside?</strong></p>



<p><em>Yes.</em></p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p><em>Well, the way we created this desktop was, okay, we want to make ready-made gaming desktops that are appealing to people, which is challenging because we are working with some awesome partners who are building systems like that already using our components, because we also have motherboards, VGAs and all these components. You can already build that.</em></p>



<p><em>Either there's a big community of just end users who build those systems themselves, PC DIY, and there are system integrators, great partners we have, that build systems for people who just want to buy a ready-made system. So how do we compete with that? We don't really want to compete with it. We want to add something else to it.</em></p>



<p><em>We want to bring something new to the market that is different, right? So we were thinking about how we can make a ready-made desktop that isn't something that's directly competing with people building their own PC or people buying something from a system integrator. And that's what we came up with. We can do a different kind of case design that has a new way of doing system cooling, a better way of doing system cooling, and we wanted to do something that allows people to customize in a way that isn't possible right now. And that's kind of how we came up with the G1000 with the NME Holo and with the thermal atrium at the top for the all-in-one water cooler for the CPU.</em></p>

<p><em>So that's kind of the whole idea behind it. If we were to sell that as a case, it would kind of defeat the purpose. I'm not saying we would never do it, but I don't think that's the plan right now.</em></p>



<p><strong>For the Zephyrus line, ASUS has two 2026 models. They're both on Intel now and not AMD, save for the third, hybrid 2025-2026 model. Where did the idea for the hybrid come from? Why keep the 2025 chassis and stick with AMD, and what prompted the move to Intel for the other two models?</strong></p>



<p><em>The switch to Intel for 2026, it's basically every time we come up with new devices, we think about 'what's our strategy,' what's our direction, what do we want to do with this device and in which direction do we want to go? Do we want to go for more performance, or longer battery life? What's our strategy? And then we look at our silicon partners, what is their strategy, and what chips do they have available, right? Then, usually, stuff just very naturally evolves in, 'okay, there's going to be a chip that has this certain power envelope and certain performance and battery life focus, and this pretty much aligns with what we want to do for this chassis or for this device.'</em></p>



<p><em>And then we naturally just work together on having this silicon in this kind of device. But there is also a part of just strategy, where you also have to look into what's the supply situation and who's giving us a good deal and who's maybe easy to work with and can guarantee us a certain supply or a certain price point or something like that. It all plays into it together. I think in the end, it was a decision made by both sides that it just makes sense to go for Panzer Lake with G14 and G16.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-Zephyrus-G14-GA403-Scenario-Rendering_01-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>For the 2025 chassis refresh with an AMD 2026 CPU, I don't know the story behind it, to be honest. I suspect that there was a demand for it, that there was interest from our sales to have that configuration for that price point.</em></p>



<p><em>I know that people are into conspiracy theories, and it's crazy the kind of mind gymnastics some people do to come up with super complex theory to explain something that is pretty straightforward. Most of the time, it is boring, but the pretty straightforward part is: why are we doing something? It's usually because people want to buy it. It's boring, but that's usually the answer.</em></p>



<p><strong>How did the collaboration with Kojima Productions come about? How did that process go, did you work directly with Hideo Kojima and Yoji Shinkawa?</strong></p>



<p><em>I wish I knew more about it, I don't know all the backstory and all the details. Yes we worked on them directly with this, and yes the design is by both Yoji Shinkawa and Hideo Kojima. This is not something we did and proposed, and then they approved it like, 'Yeah this kind of looks like what we do.' This is a design from them and we worked very closely with them, but the exact process...I think that we approached them, but I don't actually know for sure. For these kind of collaborations, it's usually us approaching different artists we would like to collaborate with, and then we see how we could work together.</em></p>

<p><em>I think we try not to do too many of these projects at the same time; we usually do one per year, one every two years, it really depends. But I would love to see us do more collaborations with game publishers and developers.</em></p>

			<p>After <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2025-a-year-of-frights/">a great 2025</a></strong>, which saw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/"><strong>return of the beloved <em>Silent Hill</em></strong></a> and the launch of several excellent horror games, <strong>2026 is poised to be a landmark year</strong>, and not only for the launch of the new entry of the series, which effectively established the survival-horror genre.

			<p>Are you looking forward to first-party PlayStation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>? Ever wanted a game to just play itself, while you put the controller down and just watch the trophies roll in? If you hear that and wonder, 'Well, what's the point of playing the game in the first place?' then you're having the same reaction to Sony's new 'AI-generated Ghost Player' patent that most of the internet seems to be having. If you think that sounds like a great way to enjoy a game, then this patent seems to be made specifically for you.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">published the filing publicly this week</a> after it was initially filed by Sony back in September 2024. The patent describes a "<em>ghost player</em>" appearing as an "<em>overlay</em>" to show the player how to complete a section of the game they're having trouble with. </p>



<p>"<em>During live gameplay by a player, game state data is analyzed in order to identify a scenario occurring in the context of the gameplay of the player. The scenario occurring during the live gameplay can then be processed by the Al model and an assistance Al engine in order to provide a ghost character with control inputs for animation/control to guiding the player in relevant interactivity of the game</em>," the filing reads. "<em>The relevant interactivity is for the context of the gameplay of the player, not just some prior gameplay of another player. The ghost character can therefore be controlled by the assistance Al engine during gameplay and provide the player with visual illustrations of how certain game scenarios are played in order for the character controlled by the player to be able to achieve progress in the game.</em>"</p>

<p>The filing also describes different modes for players to pick from. The 'Guide Mode' would show you the solution to whatever is troubling you in the game you're playing, like a puzzle in Uncharted or God of War. Whereas 'Complete Mode' would just do it for you, so you can move progress further in the game and not have to deal with that section.</p>



<p>Sony already has help systems built into the PS5's console software, with its Tips and Game Help system that lets players get increasingly more detailed hints as to how they complete a section of the game, with the most detailed hint simply telling the player what they need to do. It only works when developers opt into including those hints, but when they're there, they can be helpful to players who don't want to reach for their phone or laptop to look up a guide.</p>



<p>Players already complain when NPC allies give you the answer to a puzzle before you've had the chance to solve it yourself. It doesn't sound like this AI-generated Ghost Player would jump the gun and show you a solution before you ask for one, but going as far as to beat the section for you seems like a stretch too far for anyone who actually wants to enjoy the games they buy.</p>



<p>Of course, it is just a patent, so we may never see this actually implemented. But based on the reaction players had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Microsoft's Gaming Copilot</a> introduction last year, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/">even the idea that an AI is helping you and watching you play</a>, this doesn't seem like the kind of thing players want to have available to them.</p>



<p>You can always <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/">look up a handy guide</a>, or, of course, just try and figure it out for yourself. No one likes getting frustrated when playing a game, and getting stuck is not a good feeling. Sometimes that frustration is what makes you stop playing a game entirely. But where's the fun in watching the game play itself?</p>
