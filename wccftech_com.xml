			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles story script will be significantly bigger than the script of the original PlayStation version in terms of characters, the game's director confirmed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://publish.twitter.com/?url=https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1935191460619718669" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, director Yasumi Matsuno revealed that, in terms of characters, the Japanese script of the remaster is estimated to be around 60% bigger than the original script. Matsuno-san added that this figure does not include system-related text, chanting text, brave stories, sound novels, or cutscenes. In terms of actual text, Matsuno-san said that it is difficult to compare the total between the new and old versions, but if the increased characters are of any indication, the script has been significantly expanded over the original.</p>
<p>In terms of new content over the original PlayStation version, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles won't feature much besides additional character conversations meant to enhance the story and characters. In a new interview shared by Square Enix on its <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">official website</a>, director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed that the additional content added to the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile ports are based, won't be included, as the team wanted to recreate the original faithfully. Maehiro-san also revealed that one of the biggest challenges in developing the remaster was doing so without the original game's source code, which had been lost, which is not uncommon for older games. As such, the team analyzed various existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming, and even worked things out by feel alone by playing the game.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">September 30th.</a></p>
