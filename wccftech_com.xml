			<p>Despite the current questionable management of the brand, there's no denying that Xbox did some things right in the past. Chief among them is the backward compatibility program that makes select legacy games playable on current generation system, allowing more users to enjoy them without having to track old systems and copies of these games. In the future, Xbox backward compatibility could become even better, potentially expanding to Windows PCs and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/"><strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong></a>, if a rumored effort bears fruit.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-ronald-on-25th-anniversary-we-want-to-celebrate-the-legacy-of-xbox-as-well-as-define-the-future-of-where-the-xbox-ecosystem-is-going.1376665/post-148633819">Over on the ResetERA forums</a></strong>, reliable insider Nate the Hate, who consistently provides correct insider information, commented on the future of the Xbox ecosystem, suggesting that there's a chance backward compatibility could be expanded to more platforms.</p>



<p><em>"There exists a hope to make legacy Xbox (OG and Xbox 360) games BC on ROG and Windows. Whether they succeed is the unknown; but there is an effort being made," </em>the insider wrote. <em>"The other unknown would be how extensive will the initiative be in offerings. Will it be what we currently have on Series or will BC expand to add more titles across the Xbox ecosystem."</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first time we heard that legacy Xbox games could be coming to PC, but even if the effort is ongoing, there are many hurdles to overcome to accomplish this. One of the biggest issues that would prevent a larger library from being available on PC and the ROG Xbox Ally would be licensing issues, as reportedly, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">publishers are not willing to allow an Xbox game license to be converted into a PC game license.</a></strong></p>



<p>What seems almost certain at this point is that the next-generation Xbox, <span>rumored to be powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-power-both-console-xbox-pcs/"><strong>AMD Magnus APU</strong></a>, will be&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/" target="_blank"><strong>backward compatible with previous-generation games.</strong></a>&nbsp;T</span>he above licensing issues wouldn't apply in this case, allowing legacy games to remain playable on a current gaming system.</p>



<p>Regardless of what Xbox has planned, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=266&amp;v=6Wl8G4k6FoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"><strong>news about the ecosystem will be shared in 2026</strong></a>, which will mark the 25th anniversary of the brand. As such, we may not have to wait much longer to learn if this ongoing effort will bear fruit, and legacy games will indeed become available on PC.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a> may be the most significant game to come out of Embark Studios so far, but that doesn't mean the team has forgotten about its first-person, free-to-play shooter from 2023, The Finals. Today, Embark <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/900">is kicking off the game's third year</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-game-awards-shadow-drop/">it was shadow-dropped at The Game Awards 2023</a>, with Season 9: Dragon Rising, an update that Embark says is "<em>focused on growth, accessibility and renewed competitive momentum</em>."</p>



<p>With that focus, on top of Season 9 introducing a new megacity map called Fangwai City, a new battle pass, and several new quality of life and balance improvements - all things you might expect from a seasonal update - it's also introducing a new 8v8 gameplay mode, Point Break, and key updates to its ranked system.</p>



<p>Point Break is the clear highlight in Season 9, though not just because it's a new, bigger mode compared to other modes offered in The Finals. You may recall that <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/">Embark Studios was initially founded by former Battlefield developers</a> who wanted to return to a shooter that emphasized destructability in its matches, and to hear Embark describe the new mode in today's Season 9 reveal sounds like the team is getting back to their Battlefield roots in a way that makes sense for The Finals.</p>



<p>Point Break puts players as either attackers or defenders, with the lines of the battlefield constantly shifting, with attackers looking to destroy objectives that the defenders are charged with protecting. It's a large-scale game mode (well, large-scale for The Finals) that Embark describes as "<em>a mode where you always know where the action is headed, and what your team needs from you</em>," which could work just as well as a description for some game modes in Battlefield 6.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Point Break, the new Fangwei City map, the extra optimization work done by Embark, and all of the other quality of life improvements Embark discusses in the video above really do hammer home the point that Embark is trying to inject some life back into The Finals. "<em>Season 9 isn't just new content, it's a stronger, more flexible version of The Finals, from top to bottom</em>," Embark says in its Season 9 reveal video.</p>



<p>And it couldn't have come at a better time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">with all eyes back on Embark thanks to ARC Raiders</a>. While SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, it still doesn't exactly look great to see that The Finals <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2073850/charts/#max">hasn't had more than 50K concurrent players on Steam since January 2024</a>. While it's impressive that The Finals has been able to stick around long enough to reach its third year, which is more than can be said for <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">some other recent free-to-play multiplayer first-person shooters</a>, it can't exactly continue to survive if its numbers don't start improving.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We'll see if Season 9: Dragon Rising is the adrenaline shot that the game needed, or if it's another whiff, bringing the game closer to its demise.</p>

			<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-team17-future-games-show-gamescom-2025/">was announced this summer</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, with publisher Team17 and Expression Games bringing its brand of strategic shooter gameplay to a new setting following its initial World War II setting. </p>



<p>Today, Expression Games and Team17 put out a new gameplay trailer, after the more cinematic-focused trailer shown at Gamescom as part of the game's reveal. The trailer shows off a 50v50 battle in this "<em></em><em>war with no front lines</em>" setting.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six Vietnam maps, including dense jungles to fight through, and some more open and clear battlefields to offer strategic variety in how each match can be approached. You'll be able to hop in a helicopter and deploy troops at different points on the battlefield, take control of patrol boats for a small slice of naval combat, and North Vietnam forces can use a tunnel system to move around the maps for surprise attacks and strategic advantages against American troops.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>One thing the trailer did not include, however, was a release date, as we're still just looking at a 2026 release window. A press release for the trailer does make it clear that this is in-engine gameplay footage, however, so hopefully, this look at gameplay is a sign that we're not too far off from when a release date will be revealed.</p>



<p>Expression Games has already made it clear that it will continue to support Hell Let Loose once Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is in the public's hands, though a difference worth noting between the two titles is that there's currently no indication that Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be an early access release like Hell Let Loose before it.</p>



<p>It appears that Expression Games is just ready to release Vietnam as a full 1.0 version. Hopefully, whenever it launches, it'll feel like a full and finished product.</p>
