			<p>Unlike what has been rumored for a while, Jill Valentine won't play a major role in Resident Evil 9, according to a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, Dusk Golem commented on the rumors that have been circulating online on the yet-to-be-announced new entry in the survival-horror series, saying that Jill will not play a major role in the game, and the current hospital rumor that's circulating online is completely false, as are <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the vast majority of rumors</a> circulating on the game. The information provided by the leaker is also fresh, as they have been updated on things more recently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wait for actual RE9 news, nearly every RE9 rumor that's been floated around has been bullshit.</p>
<p>What's not bullshit is Silent Hill f did get rated in Korea today, and that's exciting.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1882066902023086459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides working on Resident Evil 9, CAPCOM is also continuing work on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil Zero Remake</a>, which, much like the ninth main entry in the series, has also yet to be officially confirmed. The development of this remake saw a big change in the people involved, but development is still proceeding, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-new-resident-evil-9-details-surface.1027635/post-134699286">according to the insider, </a>so there's plenty for fans of the series to look forward to.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Resident Evil series is the Resident Evil 4 remake, which was launched in 2023. The remake is extremely faithful to the original, if not a little too much, as Nathan highlighted in his review. The game is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 4 was the ultimate test of CAPCOM remake skills, and unfortunately, they buckled a bit under the pressure. The game suffers from minor mechanical issues and doesn’t reinvent or elevate the original material as boldly as some might have hoped it would. That said, CAPCOM hasn’t broken anything either as this is still a fun, inventive thrill ride that has been brought up to modern technical standards in striking fashion. The new Resident Evil 4 is well worth it for fans of the series, just keep your hopes slightly in check and you won’t be spin-kicked by inflated expectations.</em></p>

			<p>The multiplayer games lists are always different since they necessarily intermingle with other genres. Looking at what's coming from the releases scheduled for the calendar year 2025, we have a mix of action, RPG, Soulslike, shooter, and more. Here's the five titles that stand out the most before their respective releases.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a></em></p>

<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Most of the early multiplayer games action this year will likely kick off with CAPCOM's Monster Hunter Wilds. Like Borderlands 4, it's a game that you can absolutely complete solo, but it's just that much more fun when played with friends. Like in the massively successful Monster Hunter World, players may launch a flare to ask for help from other players in the middle of a monster hunt. The much larger zones and dynamically shifting weather should make multiplayer sessions even more exciting in the new title. Lobbies will also get a significant increase in the maximum player count, supporting <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-lobbies-100-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 100 players at once</a>.</p>

<h2>Dune Awakening (Q1 2025 PC, Consoles Later)</h2>
<p>Long before the two Dune movies were released in theaters, Funcom secured the license to develop games based on the franchise. They have since published the real-time strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-spice-wars-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Spice Wars</a> (developed by Shiro Games), but the project they've really focused on is Dune Awakening. The studio is trying to funnel all its prior expertise in the MMORPG (Anarchy Online, Age of Conan, The Secret World) and survival (Conan Exiles) genres into a hybrid game that brings out the best of both in the context of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Yes, players will have to survive the hazards of the desert planet, but there's also plenty of social play, where clans can be created and then affiliated with one of the major houses (Atreides or Harkonnen, to begin with). The key to everything will, of course, be the spice. Harvesting it will bring great rewards, as it can be traded or even consumed to gain powers (at the risk of addiction), but players will have to contend with other clans to secure the harvest - all the while trying not to rouse the dreaded sandworm. Dune Awakening is undoubtedly one of the most promising multiplayer games on this list, and it's also the closest to release. Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to launch it in the first quarter on PC</a>, with console versions to follow. For more info, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom Q&amp;A with the developers</a>, and stay tuned for further coverage in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Borderlands 4 (TBA 2025 PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Let's face it - Borderlands fans may have fun with the single player, but the reason the franchise became popular in the first place was the chaotic cooperative multiplayer action. After all, any loot-based game gets instantly more addictive when you're playing with friends with whom to boast about the latest legendary drop you got after a crazy boss fight.</p>
<p>Gearbox hasn't shared specific multiplayer info for this new installment, but the confirmed presence of new tools like the grappling hook and the seamless zones will certainly bolster the cooperative portion of the game even further.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring Nightreign (TBA 2025 PC, PS5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>FromSoftware caught everyone by surprise with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of Elden Ring Nightreign</a> at The Game Awards 2024. Most people were betting on an immediate sequel to the massively successful Elden Ring, but the Japanese studio is first working on this intriguing spin-off. Based on what they've shared, it seems like they will be mixing elements from various genres, including survival and even Battle Royale (the shrinking map, specifically), to create an entirely new multiplayer experience. Players will have to survive for three in-game days before facing a final boss to end the session.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PromoNewN1.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>PIONER (TBA 2025 on PC, Consoles Later)</h2>
<p>The upcoming MMOFPS by GFA Games was already featured in last year's most anticipated multiplayer games list. Now, though, it seems we are closer than ever to the release of PIONER, following the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise</a> to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a> at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>The premise of a STALKER-like online shared world where players can cooperate to create clans, fight in PvE raids, and even compete in PvP areas, remains incredibly enticing. We'll have to evaluate the quality of the execution, of course. Hopefully, it won't be long until we get to play it.</p>

			<p>Despite the high minimum system requirements of the PC version, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is playable on Steam Deck, although with some major compromises in terms of frame rate and image quality.</p>
<p>As highlighted in a new review by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SteamDeckHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck HQ</a>, the second entry in the Remake trilogy which launches tomorrow on PC, is more than playable on Steam Deck, keeping a 30 FPS framerate throughout the game, which is stable even in the more demanding open areas of the game. Unfortunately, plenty of compromises had to be made to keep this relatively solid 30 frames per second framerate, as dynamic resolution scaling had to be enabled, which leads to a blurry image here and there and some ghosting. Framerate in towns with a lot of NPCs is also unstable, dropping into the 20s range depending on the city, and one of the biggest issues seen in the PlayStation 5 version, the aggressive pop-in in the open areas, is also present on Steam Deck. Still, everything considered, it is definitely impressive to see Final Fantasy VII Rebirth run as well as it does on the handheld system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Steam Deck Performance Review - Playable With Major Compromises" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uAVJZLENfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on PC tomorrow, January 23rd. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>
