			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tejo-valorants-newest-agent-has-been-revealed/">Valorant</a> is set to celebrate its five-year anniversary on June 2, 2025, which is why a key focus to Act III will be celebrating the game's biggest moments in the last five years.</p>
<p>Act III and the new battle pass will be live tomorrow, April 30, 2025, featuring a special series of anniversary cards that are meant to highlight Valorant's history, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Duelists Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Cypher's Revenge Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Can't Slow Me Down Card</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Riot's lead for Valorant, <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Anna Donlon</a>, spoke about the changes the game has gone through in the last five years and the state of the world when Riot first started to launch Valorant and get players into the game.</p>
<p>She also talked about how the Valorant team at Riot is working to fix some of the longstanding issues the game has faced in the last five years, and that more information regarding those fixes will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if those fixes result in any major changes for the game. Some live service games, like Apex Legends, have been through tumultuous changes in recent years as Respawn has tried to satisfy a player base that was growing increasingly unsatisfied with the state of the game. Those same big swings might not happen here, but the potential is there, as Donlon specifically calls out balancing abilities, which could have a huge impact for a hero shooter.</p>

			<p>Borderlands 4 will launch two weeks earlier than originally announced, Gearbox Software's Randy Pitchford confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted video, which was saved and shared again on X by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a>, Gearbox's CEO confirmed that the game's development is going incredibly well, so much so that it will now be released on September 12th instead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">September 23rd</a>. Randy Pitchford added at the end of the video that the previously announced State of Play presentation focused on the game is also coming "imminently," so an official announcement shouldn't be too far away. [<strong>UPDATE</strong> - The State of Play presentation will air tomorrow, April 30th, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(Randy Pitchford jumpscare) Borderlands 4 is moving its release date up to September 12th (though he deleted this video/post because it went up too early apparently) <a href="https://t.co/ILuijVDcaL">pic.twitter.com/ILuijVDcaL</a></p>
<p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the news of Borderlands 4 launching earlier than anticipated is, by itself, excellent news, it is also great news for Grand Theft Auto VI. Publisher Take-Two Interactive previously confirmed that the sixth entry in the Rockstar Games series would launch after Gearbox Software's game, so there's a good chance Borderlands 4's release date has been moved forward in preparation for the Fall 2024 launch of what is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of all time. If this is the case, there's a very good chance that another Grand Theft Auto VI trailer will be shown soon, though a former Rockstar Games developer thinks <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">it wouldn't be necessary</a>, as the surprise factor could make the game's release even more successful.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th.</p>
