			<p>Infinity Nikki is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/">latest gacha game</a> to take the world by storm and is the perfect game for those who are fans of dress-up games and enjoy the platforming from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, as those elements feature very heavily in this game. For those who want to get stuck, the game is <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely free to play</a> and is available on PC, iOS, Android, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>For those just getting stuck in it or those who have sunk a fair amount of time into it, there are some codes that you can use to give you access to free rewards. Of course, like any game that has redeemable codes, they will expire after some time. These are the current active codes for January 2025 in Infinity Nikki.</p>
<h2>All Active Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>PEARFECTGUIDES - 10 Shining Particles and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>NIKKIXWEBTOON - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>INGIFT1205 - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some additional international codes that you can use. To be able to use them, we recommend copying and pasting them on a PC or mobile.</p>
<ul>
<li>ニキプレゼント1205 - 50 Shiny Bubbles and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>おめでとう - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>リリース - 10 Shining Particles and 15,000 Bling</li>

<li>インフィニキDISCORD&nbsp;- 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Redeem Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<p>To redeem Infinity Nikki codes, you need to have access to your Pear-Pal. You get this once you have met Dada Florawish Stylist's Guild. This is very early on in the story, so you'll find this area quickly. Once you've done that, there will be a gear icon below the Pear-Pal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Gear, and it will open the Settings menu.</li>
<li>Select 'Other'</li>
<li>There will be a Redeem Code box</li>
<li>Click on it and enter your code</li>
<li>Press 'Apply'</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your code has been entered correctly, you will get the rewards from the code. It will give you a notification about the items you've been given for using the code. There may be a message telling you that the code is incorrect or expired. As we said earlier, the codes are time-sensitive, and it's possible that the codes have now expired, and you will no longer be able to get rewards for them. Check out the expired codes below to see if the one you tried to enter is on the list.</p>
<h2>Expired Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NIKKI20241022 -&nbsp;</strong>10,000 Bling, 20 Threads of Purity and 5 Crystals</li>

			<p>2024, what a year. It has seen the utter decimation of thousands of jobs, the failures of countless "Triple-A" games and a few <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Quadruple-A" games</a>, and a general downturn in the games industry. My favourite genres - strategy and simulation - haven't had a great year, with few marquee titles. Even the stalwart of the simulation genre, Football Manager, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was delayed</a> in a move that made 2024 the break from the annual saga that started in 2003 (for the best, in my opinion) - and a number on my <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated</a> list did not see a release, with one cancellation.</p>
<p>We can't be talking about games that haven't even come out yet; we need to be talking about Strategy and Simulation games that have been released, so let's dive into Wccftech's Best Strategy and Simulation Games of 2024. As always, games that aren't released cannot be used on this list, so there are no early-access titles, nor can remasters.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2024-hop-skip-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platformer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2024-with-or-against-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports &amp; Racing</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Homeworld 3 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Strategy (Real-Time Strategy).&nbsp; <strong>Platform:</strong> PC.</p>
<p>It's most certainly the biggest name on this list. Homeworld 3 is one I first got hands-on with back in 2022. It had a delay, but it finally got a release in 2024, which was successful. While there were a few issues at launch, Homeworld 3 was and is a great game that returns you to the world and gameplay of the classic titles.</p>
<p>Here's what I said in the summary of my review of Homeworld 3:</p>
<p><em>Homeworld 3 marks a successful return to a long-revered series. Bringing back the successful space strategy series, but improving the combat by a large amount with a more tactical approach, Blackbird Interactive has successfully made their mark. With exceptional tactical combat, made all the more important by the fact that everything carries over, and one bad mistake could cripple you much further down the line. The additional War Games mode only enhances this, making for a very engaging title.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Frostpunk 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation.&nbsp; <strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation, Xbox.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is a game I was very much looking forward to, being on my most anticipated list. When I got hands-on with it in previews, I was even more interested before I finally got to review it upon release. My summary back then was:</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others.</em></p>
<p>I stick by this. Frostpunk 2 is an excellent game that firmly expanded on the original while keeping what made it great. The move from the single core to creating districts made perfect sense. Expanding the world map elements, creating outposts, and more added a whole new level to the game. This is one I recommend and one I would argue is the best game of the year on this list.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Satisfactory (<a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation. <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Satisfactory is a monster of a game. Launching first into Early Access back when I was still cuddled up in my safety blanket, nestled with a nice bottle of lukewarm milk, the thirty-year-old me never knew that it would take five and a half years to <a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully release</a>, but even before release, it would sell 5.5 million copies.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, and it's well deserved. In a genre that rarely reaches such wide reaches, Satisfactory turned building a factory - albeit one on an alien planet where you also have to survive - into something millions wanted to buy and play and an average daily player base that would make most "AAA" games envious.</p>
<p>There's not much I can say about this game that you don't already know because you play it or you've looked and decided you aren't interested. The level of detail, as complex as it is, is made so easy to get into. The creativity is excellent. The gameplay is enjoyable and addictive. Satisfactory has it all, and its success reflects that.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ara-History-Untold-Review-01-Header-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Ara: History Untold (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based Strategy (4x). <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games has finally produced another game after their debut title. While their first game is mostly remembered for being an early DirectX 12/Asynchronous Compute <a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-escalation-updated-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmark</a>, Ara: History Untold, which Xbox Game Studios published, is very much focused on the gameplay experience. It's also turn-based, whereas Ashes was a real-time strategy game. Here's what I had to say about Ara in the review:</p>
<p><em>I must admit, when not writing this review, my brain kept saying, "I like this, but", and I'd decided that I was leaning towards around a score of six and a half, but putting everything on paper and playing more, I was wrong. Ara: History Untold is a genuinely good 4X strategy game, but it has its issues. If you like the genre, you will like this. If you want a 4X with even more added depth, this will tickle your pleasure zones. I fully intend to play it more.</em></p>
<h2>Community Poll</h2>
<p>Now that the shortlist has been announced, you can vote to determine the community's winner for this category!</p>
<div id="democracy-1386" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1386,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Best Strategy/Simulation Game of 2024</strong></p></div>
<h2>Strategy and Simulation Games in 2024, and Honourable Mentions</h2>
<p>I think it's been a slow year for Strategy and Simulation games. There have only been a few marquee titles in Homeworld 3 and Frostpunk 2, but nothing that could let 2024 compete with what is still arguably the best year for the genres in recent memory: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-strategy-games-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm only human, as we all are, so there are some good-looking strategy and simulation games that we haven't played due to time or any other reason. Some such titles are <a href="https://www.songsofconquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songs of Conquest</a>, <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Coaster 2</a>, <a href="https://www.ug1775.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate General: American Revolution</a>, and <a href="https://www.f1manager.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 Manager 2024</a>, to name a few. Still, of the others we have played, here are some noteworthy titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic (<a href="https://www.sovietrepublic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Empires of the Undergrowth (<a href="https://eotugame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Diplomacy is Not an Option (<a href="https://www.door407.com/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (<a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While this has been a slow year, thanks to delays and cancellations, there are positives to look forward to. Games in early access will emerge from it, and new games will be released - likely stalwarts of genres such as Total War and, of course, Football Manager. Roll on the games of 2025!</p>

			<p>New alleged pictures of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controller surfaced online today, providing a new look at the new version of the controller launching together with the system.</p>
<p>The new pictures, which were shared on the Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwordfishAgile3472</a>, showcase the controller's side and back, providing a new look at the simple color scheme and at some of the changes from the current controller, such as bigger shoulder buttons and more. While there is no way to know if the pictures showcase the real controller, it looks legit with its attention to detail and the presence of a serial number, which could put the leaker in some serious trouble with Nintendo.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/">New Joy-con Photos from Chinese SNS</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/">u/SwordfishAgile3472</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>2025 has barely begun, but we still managed to learn plenty of new things regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, even without an official announcement. A few days ago, pictures showcasing the system's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motherboard</a> surfaced online, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">heavily scrutinized</a> in the attempt to determine the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the console. A patent filed by Nintendo earlier this week also seems to confirm the system will indeed support NVIDIA DLSS upscaling, as has been rumored for a good while.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-game-director-thought-remedy-should-aim-to-be-europes-naughty-dog/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alan Wake 2 Game Director Kyle Rowley was recently featured in an hour-long video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw0RByccsO4&amp;list=PLZeoUzft8lM_EjUOKaU4GvZDRGoWzfjgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on the Behind The Voice YouTube channel.</p>
<p>During the lengthy conversation, the industry veteran (Rowley started as a Q&amp;A tester on Black and White 2 twenty years ago, then worked as a designer on The Outsider, Homefront: The Revolution, and RuneScape before joining Remedy) revealed that he thought the Finnish studio should aim to be the European version of Naughty Dog.</p>
<p><em>When I came to Quantum Break, I was just excited about working on something that had... you know, one of my favorite games at the time was Uncharted, and I knew that we were going to do something that... I remember having a discussion with our lead animator at the time, and I was like, I think that we should be aiming to kind of be like the European version of Naughty Dog. Like, that would be cool if we could kind of get that same level of feel, and that was the type of game that I like to play, and so I was excited about working on it.</em></p>
<p>It's not at all a farfetched comparison. Both studios make action/adventure games with a highly cinematic flair. Of course, while both studios are highly acclaimed, Naughty Dog's games tend to sell a lot more - though to be fair, they also cost a lot more. For comparison, Naughty Dog's most recent game (The Last of Us Part II, which will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on PC</a> in its remastered version) cost $220 million, while Alan Wake 2 cost €70 million, according to Finnish analysts. However, Remedy is also used to make even cheaper games. Control famously only cost €30 million, and the initial budget for the upcoming sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was set at €50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog is stepping a bit into Remedy's comfort zone with its new sci-fi IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which was just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. On the other hand, Remedy appears to be following in Naughty Dog's footsteps when it comes to adapting its game IPs to live-action film/TV. Naughty Dog successfully did it (thanks to Sony, of course) with Uncharted and The Last of Us, while Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Annapurna</a> to adapt Alan Wake 2 and Control.</p>
<p>Do you feel that Remedy is on the right path to be a European Naughty Dog? Vote in the poll below.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-%E2%80%98notch%E2%80%99-persson.1074024/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, a spiritual sequel to the best-selling game ever, Minecraft, was <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> by creator Markus 'Notch' Persson. As you might recall, Persson left Mojang after selling the studio he created to Microsoft for $2.5 billion in September 2014. The following year, he founded another game development studio called Rubberbrain, which, however, never released a game.</p>
<p>Persson relaunched it in 2024 under the new name Bitshift Entertainment. On January 1, the game designer <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> openly about Bitshift's current project (a traditional roguelike mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon crawler) but also polled his fans to see if they'd rather him make a Minecraft spiritual successor. Which they did (78% voted for this option). Two days later, Persson shared the mindset behind this announcement:</p>
<p><em>I basically announced Minecraft 2. </em><em>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</em></p>
<p><em>My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for. </em><em>I intend for the money to be spent for good, but my god have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, and I also very much value being a man of my word, so I also intend to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about. </em><em>And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me.</em></p>
<p>When a fellow X user asked him if he'd really make Minecraft 2, he replied:</p>
<p><em>No, I'd make a similar game based on what I think the audience that says they want that game might enjoy. Probably do early access to make sure we're on track. </em><em>But I mean I still sort of think I'm just a clown getting lucky in a sea of actual talents, so I have no idea if it actually will be good. But I'll try.</em></p>
<p>Based on his track record, it would be no exaggeration to call him a one-trick pony, as Minecraft is his only real claim to fame in the game industry. Even if he does end up releasing such a game, it would inevitably be compared to his previous creation, which Mojang continuously updates for the legions of fans who still play it regularly.</p>
<p>The last content patch, The Garden Awakens, dropped in early December and added a new biome and a new mob. There are also plenty of spin-off games for those looking for different experiences, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/minecraft-dungeons-the-shallowest-depths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Dungeons</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-legends-will-release-on-consoles-and-pc-on-april-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Legends</a>. And A Minecraft Movie airs in theaters on April 4, 2025.</p>
