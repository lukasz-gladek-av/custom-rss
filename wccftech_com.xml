			<p>Ubisoft has proudly announced that its latest new release, the city building strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, has registered a record launch for the franchise. There have been seven Anno installments released throughout 25 years, but none captivated the audience as much as the title that launched last week.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft Mainz (previously known as Blue Byte), Anno 117: Pax Romana secured the second spot on last week's Steam chart, beating even Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which launched only a day later. You don't have to take the publisher's word for it, as SteamDB <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1990789664811172057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the news with the following Steam Top 5 chart for the week between November 11 and 18:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6 </li>



<li>Steam Deck</li>
</ul>



<p>Granted, Black Ops 7 famously delivered its own records, albeit negative, when it comes to the Call of Duty franchise. On Steam, the game only reached a concurrent player peak of around 100K users, whereas Black Ops 6 peaked at 315K when it launched last year.</p>



<p>That has, however, little to do with Anno 117: Pax Romana, whose developers are right to celebrate. Even critical acclaim is unprecedented so far, with a Metacritic average of 85 and 94% of OpenCritic reviews recommending the game. Perhaps the most important data point is that users are playing it a lot: the average daily playtime is 3,7 hours.</p>

<p>Stéphane Jankowski, Executive Producer on Anno, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana officially sets sail, marking a new chapter for our beloved franchise and for everyone who poured their passion, creativity, and countless hours into it. We are humbled by the incredible response from our player. Our team remains dedicated, continuously listening to feedback and striving to deliver the ambitious Year 1 content expanding our game world to the province of Egypt!</em></p>
