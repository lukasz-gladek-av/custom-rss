			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could support more than regular NVIDIA DLSS, as a recently filed patent outlines some brand-new tech that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">Digital Foundry</a> went through the 39 pages of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">patent</a> filed on December 31st, 2024, highlighting some interesting findings that go beyond the description of a standard NVIDIA DLSS-style upscaling. One of the most interesting findings is the confirmation that the upscaling method described in the patent, which is usually expensive in terms of compute power and bandwidth, is specifically targeted to be executed within the 120th or 160th of a second on a low-power chip, so it's most definitely not the usual DLSS seen in the PC desktop space.</p>
<p>Another equally interesting finding discovered in the Nintendo Switch 2 AI-upscaling patent is the description of something that could be labeled as dynamic AI-upscaling. According to this description, the model based upon real-time data coming from the game engine can be switched out in real-time or prepared ahead of time programmatically to use lower quality upscaling<br>
to fit within a certain frame time budget. Essentially, if the game is sending out an image that exceeds 16.6 milliseconds or 33.3 milliseconds, the device will use a lower-quality upscaling model to output the final 1080p image. This is obviously new tech that was never seen before in action and that may have been developed specifically for the Nintendo Switch 2, as something like this may not be needed in the PC desktop space unless for very low-power laptops, for example.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 patent is very broad, and describes all sorts of applications for AI-powered upscaling, such as neural decompression that could be used to bring file sizes down, and even cloud upscaling, going over various possibilities such as upscaling being done on the cloud and then sent via a stream to a local device, the upscaling getting done on the local device and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo's Switch 2 Upscaling Patent Explained: More Than Just DLSS?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4R1p1LjHME8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While AI-powered upscaling can do wonders, as shown over the past few years by NVIDIA DLSS, developers still need to get their games running decently on the Nintendo Switch 2, which could be a challenge considering the system won't be as powerful as any of the other current generation systems. According to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-and-speculation-ot-cmon-nintendo-announce-this-thing-already-up-dev-unit-leaked-partly-see-threadmarks.1077882/page-23#post-134076051">rumors</a> circulating online, there is a "movement" to try and get scaled-down Xbox Series S versions of games on the system, although it is not yet known if this has been successful so far, and with leaks having focused only on the hardware side of things, we will likely have to wait for the official reveal to see how multiplatform games will run on the system.</p>
<p>Speaking about leaks, Nintendo has finally acknowledged them in some way.&nbsp;<span>In a statement issued to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, the company said that the images and videos making the rounds are "not official."</span>&nbsp;What's interesting to note is that the company didn't say they are not accurate, so there's a solid chance we already got the first look at the system via all these leaks that have come in daily.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but at this point, it should only be a matter of days until we finally see what the Japanese company has in store for the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-naval-combat-looks-even-better-than-skull-and-bones/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Direct</a>, the Japanese developer shared a lot of new info on their next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-new-trailer-shows-more-of-goro-majimas-new-pirate-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, which is slated to launch next month. The 13-minute video demonstrated ground combat, but its highlight was certainly naval combat, which fans have commented looks even better than Ubisoft's naval-only title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skull and Bones</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you agree or not, naval combat in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii certainly sounds quite deep. To begin with, players will get to fully customize the Goromaru pirate ship, including hull, armor, sails, and figurehead. The game also lets them hire their crew among a roster of over a hundred sailors, who have their own attributes and can subsequently be improved by deepening the crew's bonds through song, drink, adventure, and victory. They will then have to be optimally assigned to attack or defense operations.</p>
<p>Of course, a key component of naval combat is installing, upgrading, and firing cannons. This is where the IP's outlandish nature shines, offering options for energy cannons, laser cannons, and even 'shark cannons'. Of course, boarding is also available in the game, allowing the crews to come to blows in frenetic melee combat. Before the end of the video, the developers also confirmed that the New Game Plus mode will be added to the game for free after launch.</p>

<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin-off set after the events narrated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. Series mainstay Goro Majima is the lead character. At the start of the story, he washes on Rich Island with no recollection of his previous life.</p>
<p>The game is scheduled to be released on February 21 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-against-its-designation-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-the-us-department-of-defense/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chinese corporation Tencent has <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will fight its inclusion in the list of Chinese military companies <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-00070.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided by the US Department of Defense</a>. Earlier this week, the news caused a significant drop (around 10%) in the company's stock.</p>
<p>Tencent is seeking a negotiation with the US Department of Defense but may also initiate a lawsuit if it cannot reach an agreement. Here's the full official statement:</p>
<p><em>As the Company is neither a Chinese military company nor a military-civil fusion contributor to the Chinese defense industrial base, it believes that its inclusion in the CMC List is a mistake. Unlike other lists maintained by the U.S. Government for sanctions or export control measures, inclusion in the CMC List relates only to U.S. defense procurement, which does not affect the business of the Group.</em></p>
<p><em>The CMC List is also distinct from the Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex List (NS-CMIC List) maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and inclusion in the CMC List will not prohibit any persons (other than the Department of Defense) from business dealings with the Company, including transacting in the securities of the Company.</em></p>
<p><em>The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake. During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the Company from the CMC List.</em></p>
<p>Tencent offers various online products and services in China, like the messaging apps Tencent QQ and WeChat, though it is perhaps best known in the Western world for its gaming division. For a while now, it's been the largest gaming publisher in the world by revenue, well ahead of Sony and Microsoft, although the latter has reduced the gap following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>Tencent also invested heavily in game studios located outside China. It owns Riot Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-offers-to-fully-acquire-funcom-scope-of-dune-survival-game-to-be-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funcom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-the-division-devs-create-sharkmob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharkmob</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-buy-sumo-digital-for-919-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sumo Group</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-majority-grinding-gear-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grinding Gear Games</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-imminent-acquisition-leyou-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leyou</a> (owner of Athlon Games, Splash Damage, and Digital Extremes). It also holds majority stakes in <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-rock-studios-is-the-latest-studio-acquisition-made-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turtle Rock Studios</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquired-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techland</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-becomes-a-majority-shareholder-at-rime-developer-tequila-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tequila Works</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-starve-mark-of-the-ninja-klei-entertainment-acquired-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klei Entertainment</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-1c-entertainment-polish-group-to-be-rebranded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulqrum Publishing</a> (previously known as 1C Entertainment), <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-wake-up-interactive-teases-new-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wake Up Interactive</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightingale-inflexion-games-bought-tencent-spatialos-not-being-used/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inflexion Games</a>, 10 Chambers Collective, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yager-spec-ops-the-line-gets-strategic-minority-investment-by-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yager Development</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-purchased-36-percent-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fatshark</a>, Miniclip and Supercell, as well as minority stakes in Don't Nod, Shift Up, Epic Games, Bloober Team, Marvelous, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FromSoftware</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy</a>, Krafton, Kakao, Paradox Interactive, Frontier Developments, and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Rumors about the potential acquisition of the latter company have <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intensified</a> lately. Just yesterday, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed</a> advisors to review potential sale options. A couple of years ago, Tencent reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-is-reportedly-shifting-its-ma-strategy-to-majority-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted</a> its M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) strategy to majority deals only.</p>
