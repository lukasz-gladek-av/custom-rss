			<p><strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong>, the studio behind the biggest flop and the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/2025/metascore/?page=19">worst-reviewed game of 2025</a>, <strong>MindsEye</strong>, is still chipping away at fixing and improving the game that was the butt of its fair share of jokes last year. The game's latest update, <strong>Update 7</strong>, is "<em>a big step forward</em>" for both the game and the studio, according to <strong>Mark Gerhard</strong>, chief executive and chief technical officer at Build a Rocket Boy.</p>



<p>The new update focuses on improvements to "<em>campaign flow, making objectives easier to follow, and continuing to refine AI behavior</em>," the patch notes on the <a href="https://support.mindseye.game/hc/en-gb/articles/41491756760205-Update-7">game's official website reads</a>. The tangible effects of that statement include more objective markers and viewpoint locations in certain missions, changes to mission design, like removing an "<em>unfair</em>" failure condition in one mission and increasing a character's health in others for a more balanced experience.</p>



<p>Gerhard also confirmed that the studio is working on new content for the game, but it feels like that might be putting the cart before the horse, since Build a Rocket Boy has to get MindsEye to a more playable, acceptable state before it can get players excited about new content.</p>



<p>"<em>Update 7 is <strong>a big step forward for MindsEye, and our studio</strong>,</em>" Gerhard said in a press release. "<em>I want to thank everyone who's been playing and sharing feedback, and our dedicated team who have worked incredibly hard to continue to delight our community. We've listened, we've moved quickly, and we're continuing to refine performance, make continuous improvements, and deliver substantial combat and gameplay enhancements.</em> <strong><em>New content is in</em> <em>development</em></strong><em>, and we're committed to steady, meaningful progress. Our core focus remains on delivering the MindsEye experience we always envisioned and the one our players deserve</em>."</p>

<p>Even before MindsEye launched last year, there was reason to suspect things weren't going well at Build a Rocket Boy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">Two of the studio's chief executives left the company,</a> just two weeks before the game was due to come out. Prior to those departures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">early previews of the game had been very negative</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game getting out in the wild early, without a day-one patch</a>, fueled many of the memes that came out of the game.</p>



<p>Not that those meme creators needed the unpatched version to harp on the game. Even after its day-one patch, the game was in such poor shape that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation offered players refunds</a></strong>, and the studio said it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">"<em>heartbroken</em>"</a> with how the game's launch had gone. </p>



<p>Following the poor launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">the studio suffered <strong>mass layoffs</strong>,</a> while founder and<a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/"> former <strong>Rockstar</strong> producer, <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, blamed internal and external "<em>saboteurs</em>"</a> for the game's poor state. Developers at Build a Rocket Boy, however, lay the game and the studio's issues <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">at the feet of Benzies, Gerhard, and the rest of the management team</a>, with an open letter calling out Benzies for his poor management and behaviour. </p>



<p>Shortly after the open letter was published, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">a report from the BBC revealed more about the studio's internal issues,</a> which, once again, pointed to Benzies, Gerhard, and the rest of the studio's leadership as the source of the problems. Most recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-said-to-have-ended-publishing-deal-with-io-interactive-after-last-years-mindseye-bomb/">a report from last month pointed to Build a Rocket Boy and <strong>IO Interactive</strong> ending their publishing deal,</a> with Build a Rocket Boy said to be the one choosing to end the deal so it could have more control over it and MindsEye's future.</p>



<p>If Build a Rocket Boy is able to fix MindsEye and deliver a game truly worth experiencing, then that'll be one of the greatest comebacks in video game history. But it'll take a lot more than just a bunch of bug fixing to get there. For all its technical faults at launch, underneath the bugs, <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong> was always a world-class RPG. MindsEye didn't get a <strong>37</strong> on Metacritic just because it was broken on release. Even when it was working, players still called out its flawed gameplay, design, and narrative.</p>



<p>If Build a Rocket Boy is able to redeem the game, that redemption won't come without significant changes. It may even be an entirely different game by that point, if Build a Rocket Boy is able to get there.</p>
