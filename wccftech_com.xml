            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Gearbox Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> up the official pre-orders for Borderlands 4. Fans of the looter shooter franchise certainly held their breath for a while when Gearbox president Randy Pitchford wouldn't confirm the pricing, and now they can rest a bit easier knowing that the game won't be priced at $80 as some had feared.</p>
<p>Alongside the opening of pre-orders, though, the Texas-based development studio also revealed the minimum and recommended PC requirements for Borderlands 4. They can be read on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> pages, although we've posted them below too for your convenience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p>Considering that Borderlands 4 is powered by Unreal Engine 5, these system requirements are fairly tame compared to others we've seen. The game is also said to offer the largest and most seamless map in the franchise, with anything you see in the distance reachable by the players.</p>
<p>Traversal has been improved, too, with moves such as double jumping, gliding, dodging, and grappling available. As with the previous entries, drop-in, drop-out cooperative gameplay is said to be the centerpiece of the game, and cross-play is also supported (although you'll need to sign up for a SHiFT Account to join fellow teammates from other platforms).</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to debut on September 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-neo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-%E2%80%98neo%E2%80%99.1219821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-neo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, French cloud platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-impressions-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHADOW</a> announced '<a href="https://shadow.tech/shadowpc/offers/#pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neo</a>', a new tier of its cloud gaming offering. Neo replaces the previous 'Boost' tier with much-improved specifications, delivering greatly accelerated performance in gaming (up to 150%) and software (up to 200%). All current subscribers at the Boost tier have been upgraded to Neo, which is still priced at $37.99 monthly, taxes excluded. These are the updated specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD EPYC – 8 vCores @ 3.25-3.8GHz</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Equivalent to NVIDIA RTX 4060 16GB (Server-grade NVIDIA RTX 2000 ADA 16GB)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR5</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> 1Gb/s fiber connection</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11</li>
</ul>
<p>Olivier Abecassis, CEO at Shadow, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Neo is our newest and most versatile cloud PC yet. Whether you’re gaming in 2K with RTX and DLSS, editing complex 3D models, or working on the go, Shadow Neo gives you the power of a high-end PC — instantly and from anywhere.</em></p>
<p>The new configuration supports DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.3, RTX, DLSS, FSR, and Frame Generation. This, however, raises the question of whether the Power tier makes any sense anymore. Currently, Power provides access to a similar CPU and an older GPU, the RTX 3070 Ti. When factoring in the fact that the RTX 4060 has access to DLSS Frame Generation while the RTX 3070 Ti does not, paying $50 for the Power tier does not make much sense, as the performance is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdmAG4PL7Nk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly the same</a> in some games. SHADOW will have to upgrade this tier too shortly to make it viable again.</p>
<p>Overall, you might be baffled to hear about such high prices compared to, for example, NVIDIA's GeForce NOW platform, which lets you rent an RTX 4080-class GPU for $20 monthly. The big difference is that SHADOW gives you access to a whole PC, so you can use it however you see fit. That means installing any kind of software, or, staying within the gaming subject, being able to install mods for your PC games, which isn't really possible on GeForce NOW (or similar competitors like Boosteroid).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-it-is-still-deep-in-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has finally provided an update on how things are going with the highly anticipated Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, and the update is that they're still working on it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">post on the studio's official Prince of Persia X account</a>, Ubisoft simply says, "<em>Yep, we're still deep in the game - exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. This game is being created by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us</em>."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642139247321113">follow-up post</a>, Ubisoft reminds players that there's another Prince of Persia game they could go play right now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>While development continues behind the scenes, there's another adventure waiting for you right now: The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>."</p>
<p>The post also includes a new piece of art from the game, displaying the exterior of one of the buildings those who played the original game will remember.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Last month, the company's annual earnings report confirmed that the remake will be out by<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/"> March 2026</a>, which is only a small update from the game's previous release window of '<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/">sometime in 2026</a>'.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-will-expand-farahs-character-long-development-time-is-due-to-high-remake-bar/">previously spoken</a> about having a high bar for this remake, which is evident from the fact that the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/">entirely rebooted the game's development once before</a>, after its initial reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">failed to impress</a>.</p>
<p>It may be upsetting for fans of the series who are looking forward to this remake that there's still basically no update on how things are going, but it's also not surprising given <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">Ubisoft's muted appearance during this year's Summer Game Fest festivities</a>. And with the lack of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/">Ubisoft Forward</a> event for 2025, it's not worth holding your breath on any major updates from Ubisoft this year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sloclap-reveals-rematch-won%E2%80%99t-support-cross-play-at-launch-just-before-it-released-in-early-access.1219770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rematch, the upcoming soccer game from Sifu developer Sloclap, is due to arrive for everyone this <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/">Thursday, June 19, 2025</a>.&nbsp;</strong>It should be an exciting launch for the studio, as Rematch had an extremely popular beta test with more than 1.9 million players jumping in on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>But that excitement has been significantly quelled, with today's reveal by Sloclap that the game will not support cross-play between players on other platforms.</p>
<p>"<em>Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won't be available at launch,</em>" <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143">Sloclap announced in a post on the game's official X account</a>. "<em>But it's one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! We'll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934628094624567591">separate post</a>, Sloclap said it "<em>aimed for launch but couldn't quite get it ready in time. We're actively working on it.</em>"</p>
<p>Rematch is already available for those who paid for early access, and it was only about an hour before that early access launch that Sloclap delivered the disappointing news about cross-play functionality. It's clear the team was trying to have it ready in time, but delivering the news so close to the game's early access release, the one reserved for those who paid extra for the privilege of playing three days early, is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lcua7w/the_game_still_feels_like_a_beta/">upsetting players online</a>.</p>
<p>The mood around Rematch isn't helped by the fact that players are reporting major server issues impacting their experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="REMATCH | Golden Rules Trailer | Release Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFMw23F-KbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hopefully, by the time the game is available for everyone on Thursday, Sloclap has resolved the biggest of its server issues, and players are able to have a smoother time than they are now. And hopefully it doesn't all break again once cross-play support is added.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-%E2%80%93-tips-for-surviving-arrakis.1219737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/">Dune: Awakening</a> is a wonderfully immersive game that allows players to insert themselves in the world of Arrakis and play among the sandworms and political intrigue the series is known for, but before you get to any of that, you need to live long enough to see it.</p>
<p>Surviving on Arrakis in Dune: Awakening is, whether you like it or not, painfully accurate to what it would be like if you were to try living on the desert planet for longer than a day. And it doesn't exactly help your case that the game begins with your player character crash-landing on the planet, with barely anything but the clothes on your back.</p>
<p>While you are guided through some concrete survival steps in the game's opening hours, this guide will take you through the minutiae of what it takes to survive on Arrakis, and the new way of thinking you'll need to adjust to in order to make sure you'll be able to see the sun rise on a new day on Dune.</p>
<h2>Dune: Awakening - Tips for Surviving Arrakis</h2>
<h4>ABP - Always Be Prepared</h4>

<figure></figure>

<p>On one level, always being prepared means having the tools and resources you'll need to survive at the ready. But more accurately, it means developing habits that ensure you never get caught off guard.</p>
<p>For example, having enough dart ammo in your backpack or making sure your literjon of water is filled before heading out is easy enough to remember, but you also want to make sure you're not without survey probes. Surveying new areas is an absolute must because it'll clear away the fog from the new parts of the map you're exploring and give you a clear picture of how to travel safely.</p>
<p>If you don't know where the actual closest rock formation is to your current location, it's easy to get caught out in open sand for too long. And you do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> want to be caught in open sand for too long. That's a fast track to losing everything in the gullet of a sandworm.</p>
<p>This is also why your map is arguably your biggest support for everything you'll do in Dune: Awakening. Knowing where to go next so you're safely travelling across the planet is one thing, but another is the fact that your map will also show you where to gather resources you need to stay alive and craft the vehicles and devices you need to aid your survival. ABP means keeping your map up to date, your inventory stocked with essentials, and ensuring that you can handle whatever situations come your way.</p>
<h3>Store your vehicle(s)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Take it from someone who has already gone through this experience. Store your vehicle, do not simply leave it next to your base in a shaded area, thinking that'll be enough to keep it safe from the elements on Arrakis. It isn't, and you'll return to your time away from the game with a bike that's wrecked beyond repair.</p>
<p>When you reach the point where you're crafting your first bike to drive across the sands, you'll also be able to craft a device that'll let you store your bike and redeploy it when you need to make those longer treks across Dune. You should consider this device now part of your permanent inventory, as it is a key piece of kit to have if you plan to do any kind of quick travelling between various points of interest on the planet.</p>
<h3>Build for mobility, not for settlements (at first)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>When you first start building your own base, it's tempting to begin to design your dream home on Arrakis. There's already excellent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcuvbl/first_base_ive_ever_been_proud_of_spent_so_long/">examples</a> on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lalsnm/people_here_are_posting_some_awesome_futuristic/"> Dune: Awakening Reddit page</a> of really impressive bases, in terms of design, and<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcl2z7/who_needs_thopters_i_have_a_ramp/"> functionality</a>. These are not the kinds of bases you should look to grind out and build off the top.</p>
<p>In the same way you can store a vehicle, you can store a bases design - but not the base itself. That, you'll have to rebuild, using your construction tool as you move deeper into Arrakis and away from Hagga Basin.</p>
<p>You will reach a point where it is worth building a more <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-extensive-base-building-feature/">permanent settlement</a> that you'll return to time and again, but there's no point in trying to make your first base that permanent home. Not only will it make your attempts at keeping it with you as you move into Arrakis more difficult, since you'll almost certainly not be able to hold enough materials to build it all at once wherever you decide to put down your sub-fief, but abandoning your first base is in fact a mission objective in the early hours of the game.</p>
<p>So until it makes sense, don't get attached to your base. Oh, and as a side note for when you do build your permanent base, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l7tan4/example_immersive_build_without_ruining_pathing/">make sure you're not blocking anyone's path</a>. It's annoying enough to have to plan your travel across the sands around not being out in the open for too long. You don't want to add to that by being the person who build their base between two rock formations causing a route blockage for everyone else in your server.</p>
<h3>Keep the lights on in your base, or risk losing it</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Speaking of your base, you absolutely need to ensure it always has power. The generator you build for your base does more than just keep your fabricator or blood purifier working, it also generates a shield for your base to protect it from the elements on Arrakis. If you don't keep it powered up, you risk your base being picked apart by the elements - or worse, picked clean by other players raiding your stuff.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see how long your base can maintain power for, and if you don't have every machine in it crafting large-scale devices then the drain on its fuel won't be too dire at all. It's not a difficult thing to keep it powered, but it can be an easy thing to forget. And survival always seems to come down to not forgetting the little things.</p>
<h3>You won't win against a sandworm, a sandstorm, or the sun, so don't chance it</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are three elements of Arrakis that you simply won't win against and should not take your chances on. Sandworms, sandstorms, and the sun.</p>
<p>The sandworms are a pretty obvious one. They're huge, will swallow you and everything you have on you whole, and are to be avoided at all times. Shai-Hulud is respected and worshipped for a reason, and as far as we know, Funcom has no plans to add a skill-tree where the end goal is gaining the powers of Atreides descendant <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Sheeana_Brugh">Sheeana</a>. Make sure you have an escape plan, whether that's heading to the nearest rock formation, or flying out of there with an orinthopter, when sandworms are close by.</p>
<p>Sandstorms on Arrakis are to be feared just as much, and you'll need to ensure you have a way of taking shelter should you hear the warning that one is headed towards your area. Once the warnings begin, every moment spent out in the open to gather more resources or make it to your next destination is done at your own peril.</p>
<p>Lastly, the sun is the third part of this trifecta of terror that you need to always be aware of when travelling the sands of Arrakis. It will boil you faster than you think, dehydrate you faster, and slowly tick down your health if you're caught out in it for too long. This is why you should always travel at night, especially in the early hours of the game when you're working your way up to building your first bike. You travel, build, basically do anything, at your own peril in the heat of the Arrakis sun.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer.1219734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods</a>, likely the biggest and most popular repository for game mods that PC players have relied on for more than two decades, has been sold, the previous owner and creator, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed">Dark0ne, announced</a>.</p>
<p>Dark0ne ran the site for 24 years and made the decision to sell and step back from the day-to-day operations of the website after it took too much of a personal toll on them.</p>
<p>"<em>The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,</em>"&nbsp;Dark0ne wrote in their blog post announcing the sale.</p>
<p>"<em>The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole</em>."</p>
<p>While Dark0ne doesn't disclose who the new owner of the website is, they do make it clear that they are confident that the site is being passed into good hands.</p>
<p>"<em>One of the biggest reasons I've been doing this for so long is that I've never felt that I truly found someone who really "gets" the modding community the way I do. Finding a new owner who would be able to understand and respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community was essential.</em></p>
<p><em>After months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching, I am thrilled to say that I truly believe I have found the exact right people for the task.</em></p>
<p><em>So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate “exit” or a backroom deal. This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.</em>"</p>
<p>Dark0ne continues to say that on the player and modder side of things, there won't really be any changes, and that the biggest change is simply the ownership, and the fact that Dark0ne won't be the person who has to sign-off on everything happening with the website.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-crossed-the-10-billion-downloads-milestone/">Nexus Mods crossed 10 billion mod downloads</a> in its lifetime. An impressive feat, and a solid one for Dark0ne to leave on at the end of their tenure. It'll be interesting to see who is taking over the site, if/when the new ownership is disclosed. So many players around the world rely on Nexus Mods. For their sake, and the sake of the PC modding community, hopefully this new era for the site is even better than the last.</p>
