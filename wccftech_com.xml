			<p>We know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest</a> will have plenty of announcements, reveals, and special looks at upcoming games, and we can add another to the list as Kojima Productions has confirmed that Hideo Kojima will join Geoff Keighley on the Summger Game Fest mainstage to host a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach 'game premiere' presentation on Sunday, June 8.</p>
<p>It'll go live at 7pm PT / 10pm ET, and per the current Summer Game Fest <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/events">schedule</a>, it'll be the weekend's final event to close out this year's SGF. According to a press release, it'll be the start of a "<em>world tour</em>" for Death Stranding 2 that will lead up to the launch, and keep going all the way into November of this year.</p>
<p>As far as what the presentation will show, the press release adds that it will be an "<em>exclusive look</em>" at the game, and that there will be other special guests joining Kojima and Keighley on stage. It doesn't go into who these guests will be, but a good bet would be that the core cast of the game will join Kojima and Keighley on stage.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of where the Death Stranding 2 tour will go, and when the tour will be making its stop:</p>
