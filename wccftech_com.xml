			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-august-lies-of-p-day-z-my-hero-ones-justice-2/">announced</a> the three games that PS Plus subscribers from the entry-level Essential tier and up will be able to redeem, with Round 8's Lies of P as the headline game for August, and the only game with a native PS5 version available. </p>



<p>The other two games players will be able to redeem are the hardcore zombie survival game DayZ and the 3D arena fighting game My Hero One's Justice 2. All three titles will be available for players to redeem on August 5, 2025, which means that the last chance you'll have to redeem Diablo IV, Jusant, and The King of Fighters XV, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">three games for July,</a> is August 4, 2025.</p>

<p>Lies of P entering the service next week is perfect timing for players who've perhaps been looking at Round 8's excellent take on action-RPG games with a more lustful eye since the release of its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Lies of P</a> at launch in 2023, he called it "<em>a solid imitation of FromSoftware's Bloodborne that manages to stay fun for the entire duration of a single playthrough of around 20 hours despite a marked lack of innovation.</em>" When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">reviewed the Overture DLC</a> earlier this year, he called it "<em>an expansion in the true sense of the word,"</em> and "<em>a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more.</em>"</p>



<p>Now you can get the base game for no extra cost beyond your existing PS Plus subscription, and pick up the DLC for a fraction of the cost of the original game. All together, not a bad deal for Bloodborne and FromSoftware fans who've not yet checked out Lies of P.</p>

			<p>Godbreakers is a new four-player co-op action hack'n'slash game from publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/atari-to-acquire-82-6-stake-in-thunderful-group-with-e4-5-million-investment-amid-restructuring-and-layoffs/">Thunderful Games</a> and its subsidiary studio, To The Sky, and it'll be arriving on PS5 and PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store later this year. But you can play it right now if you want to, thanks to a demo currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2687400/GODBREAKERS/">Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Godbreakers sets players against an unbound and presumably evil artificial intelligence called Monad, whose legions of creatures you'll defeat by absorbing their powers and turning their own strength back on them. </p>



<p>The reveal trailer also shows how movement and learning enemy patterns seem key to gameplay, especially if you're taking on the challenge on your own.</p>

<p>"<em>As the first title for our studio, we wanted to create a game that feels fast, fluid and fun, where every moment is a chance to unleash chaos alongside your friends,"</em> said chief executive officer and executive producer at To The Sky, Jugo Mirkovic, in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>We’ve poured years worth of knowledge into crafting the best gameplay experience possible in&nbsp;</em><em>Godbreakers,</em>&nbsp;and we’re so excited to finally share it with the world."</p>



<p>Though there's no release date currently set for Godbreakers, the fact that there's a demo already available when Thunderful and To The Sky are announcing the game is a strong sign that they'll be able to hit its 2025 release window. Hopefully we'll have an official release date to look forward to soon.</p>
