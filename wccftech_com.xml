			<p>Woochi the Wayfarer is a new single-player action-adventure game developed by LoreVault Studio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-the-first-descendant-death-relives/">The First Descendent</a> developer, Nexon Games, signed on as its publisher. Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> leaned on a famous Chinese story, Woochi the Wayfarer leans on a famous Korean story, as a press release reveals the game is a depiction of 'The Tale of Jeon Woochi,' a famous Korean novel.</p>



<p>Nexon Games and LoreVault Studio debuted a nearly two-and-a-half-minute cinematic trailer, which set up the grandeur that the Unreal Engine 5 game is certainly going for, but didn't provide any real insight into the gameplay or what the final product will look like when it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. A release date, or even a release window, was not provided.</p>

<p>In a press release, Nexon Games chief executive officer, Park Yong-hyun, said "<em>Woochi the Wayfarer will provide a fresh and unique play experience that is based on traditional Korean materials while also having an emotional resonance that anyone around the world can relate to. We plan to present a game that will appeal to gamers of all cultures, telling an amazing story that fully showcases Nexon Games' development capabilities and accumulated experience</em>."</p>



<p>The game's soundtrack is inspired by traditional Korean music and is being composed by Korean composer Jung Jae-il, whose work you might recognize from the film Parasite or the Netflix series, Squid Game.</p>



<p>Between the storytelling, the visuals, and the music, it'll be cool to see Korean culture on display in Woochi the Wayfarer. Hopefully, the game is able to stick the landing with its gameplay on top of what already seems to be a strong setting.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-has-been-caught-making-changes-to-the-steam-page-for-horizon-rip-off-light-of-motiram-after-sony%E2%80%99s-lawsuit.1267350/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Tencent first announced Light of Motiram, everyone, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">Wccftech</a>, immediately saw it as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/">clone</a> or rip-off of Sony's Horizon series. Which is why no one was surprised when, at the end of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/">a copyright lawsuit from Sony attacked Tencent</a> for Light of Motiram. The lawsuit cites the multiple headlines that drew the same connections we did, and goes as far to call Light of Motiram a "<em>slavish clone</em>" of Guerilla Games' series.</p>



<p>Now that Sony has pulled the lever on a lawsuit, Tencent has been caught making a few potentially legally-significant changes to Light of Motiram's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">Steam page</a>. Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/">The Game Post</a>, the key art for Light of Motiram has been changed, the game's description has been rewritten, and multiple screenshots, including ones featuring Light of Motiram's own red-haired player character, have been removed.</p>



<p>The game's original description on Steam read as such: </p>



<p>"<em>In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy machination, survive with mechanimals</em>."</p>



<p>The new description for the game now reads: </p>



<p>"<em>Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land</em>."</p>



<p>A much more generic game description that doesn't reference the Mechanimals that look directly styled after the robotic dinosaurs featured in Horizon.</p>



<p>Will these changes and removals have any significant impact on the lawsuit? Who knows, it's too early to tell which way things will sway, no matter how obvious the case might seem on the outside. Especially when considering details that the lawsuit revealed, like how Tencent apparently went to Sony asking if the two companies could partner on making a Horizon game. Sony declined, according to the lawsuit, and Tencent followed up that encounter with Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>It might look open-and-shut, and like Tencent decided to copy as much as they could from Horizon in order to leverage the similarities to create a new hit title, but copyright suits are rarely open-and-shut, especially ones where two massive companies are going head-to-head. Whichever way it swings, we can be sure that it will set an interesting precedent for the future.</p>
