			<p><strong>Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape</strong> is a new large scale mod project that aims to <strong>restore content cut by CAPCOM</strong> from the original game while also <strong>adding several things</strong>, including the classic Ink Ribbon save system and new locations. Here's the official overview:</p>



<p><em>This mod is a complete reimagining and expansion of Resident Evil 3 Remake. I’m restoring cut content and adding entirely new locations, expanding the city, and redesigning core gameplay systems to create a darker, more survival-focused experience inspired by the original game. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>Features: </strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>New playable locations (city areas, UpTown, Clock Tower, Park, Disused Plant, Cemetery, RPD, and more)</em></li>



<li><em>Expanded and reworked level layouts</em></li>



<li><em>New Nemesis encounters and boss fights</em></li>



<li><em>Redesigned item placement and progression</em></li>



<li><em>New puzzles and mechanics</em></li>



<li><em>Reworked crafting system with multiple new gunpowder types</em></li>



<li><em>Ink Ribbon save system from Resident Evil 2</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The YouTube channel includes several demonstration videos of Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape. We've embedded a few below.</p>

<p>As with all these projects, there is no release window in sight, so <strong>it may be a while before it becomes available</strong>. It isn't, however, the first mod of its kind: in 2020, the <strong>Resident Evil 3 Remake Expanded Map Mod</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-3-remake-expanded-map-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slightly expanded the map</a> and allowed more free exploration in the early game, though its scope was much narrower than Resident Evil 3 Remake Last Escape.</p>



<p>Out of all the Resident Evil remakes, Resident Evil 3 <strong>is definitely the least successful</strong>, having been criticized by critics and fans alike for its short length, a problem made all the more evident after the cuts of locations like the Clock Tower and the Park, which the mod mentioned in this article is attempting to restore. Even so, perhaps "least successful" deserves air quotes, as the game <strong>still managed to reach CAPCOM's Best-Selling Top 10 chart with 10.90 million units sold</strong> as of the most recent update of this quarter.</p>
