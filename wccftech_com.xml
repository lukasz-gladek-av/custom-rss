			<p>As part of PlayStation's celebration of the platform's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> last year, PS5 owners enjoyed console themes based on each PlayStation console generation. These themes were only available for a limited time until today, when Sony announced that they are making a return in a system update that will be rolling out across the globe tomorrow, April 24, 2025.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/new-ps5-system-software-update-features-audio-focus-and-the-return-of-the-classic-console-ui-customizations/">PlayStation Blog</a> post about tomorrow's update, Sony Interactive Entertainment's vice president of product management, Shuzo Kikuchi, announced a new feature coming to the system called Audio Focus. This new audio setting is designed to make the softer sounds in games louder for players using headphones, with the provided example being to make things like footsteps come through more audibly in your headphones.</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the classic console themes, Kikuchi admitted that their return was solely due to fans asking for them to return.</p>
<p>"<em>During our 30th anniversary celebrations, we surprised our fans with a limited time selection of nostalgic customization features for the PS5 System UI to honor the four PlayStation consoles that paved the way for PS5: PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4,</em>" Kikuchi wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Due to the overwhelmingly positive response from our community, we're happy to bring back the look and feel of the four console designs for players to customize the home screen on PS5!</em>"</p>
<p>When you update your PS5 console, you'll be able to find these returning themes under a new menu in the system's settings called 'Appearance.' Having different themes for your Home screen has been a key customization feature PlayStation players have enjoyed since the dawn of the PS3.</p>
<p>Hopefully, bringing these themes back is just the first step towards more, like the many game-specific themes that used to be available. A few first-party and second-party titles already have themes set for the Welcome menu, but nothing like the themes from the 30th anniversary, which changed the console's entire UI. Players would surely love to see more of the latter down the line.</p>
