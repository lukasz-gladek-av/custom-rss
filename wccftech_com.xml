			<p>Journalist Stephen Totilo has <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the current developer of the Star Wars KOTOR Remake. It's Mad Head Games, the Serbian studio behind defunct hack 'n' slash action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/pagan-online-revealed-debut-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pagan Online</a> and sci-fi action/adventure game Scars Above (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/scars-above-the-definition-of-one-and-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we reviewed here</a>). They're also working on Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-gamescom-hands-on-preview-pleasure-and-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we previewed at Gamescom 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Mad Head Games is a subsidiary of Saber Interactive, following the split from the Embracer Group. We know that a team at Saber was working on the game. A year and a half ago, their CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the development was progressing well.</p>



<p>Let's rewind the long and problematic development story of the Star Wars KOTOR Remake. The first rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-might-be-getting-a-reimagining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started circulating in January 2020</a>, before the world was even fully aware of COVID-19. The game was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the September 2021 PlayStation Showcase as an exclusive for PC and PlayStation 5. Back then, Aspyr Media was working on it, but their project <a href="https://wccftech.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was paused in mid-2022</a> following an unsuccessful demo presentation to Sony and Lucasfilm. Shortly afterward, we learned that the developer had changed, but we never knew the exact studio until now.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Totilo revealed that Disney and Lucasfilm Games have been planning a Star Wars KOTOR II remake (codenamed Juliet) as well, as recently as March 2025, which would also include the content cut from the original version. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1phogew/comment/nt0ij6e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a Reddit post</a>, he then explained that the info comes from a legal deposition:</p>



<p><em>Yes, this is more than a rumor because the person who talked about it during their legal deposition was Douglas Reilly, the longtime VP of Lucasfilm Games. The reason for the March cut-off on this is because that's when the deposition was. At that time, he said it "is still technically on the road map” and that “we’re starting with the remake of KOTOR I." I don't know about the status of either KOTOR remake since then.</em></p>



<p>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was originally developed by BioWare. Launched in July 2003, it is considered to be one of the best RPGs of all time, although its combat system would feel pretty dated nowadays and must certainly be among the most significant changes in the KOTOR Remake, just like with Final Fantasy VII. Its sequel, KOTOR II: The Sith Lords, was developed by Obsidian and launched in December 2004. It was also well received, although not quite to the extent of the first franchise entry.</p>



<p>As a separate rumor from Totilo's reveal, leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1997385253795590237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that a major Star Wars game announcement, whose title ends with "The Old Republic," is coming soon, presumably hinting at a reveal during The Game Awards 2025. That said, take this piece of info with a grain of salt.</p>

			<p>We've seen Amazon's TV series adaptation of Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson's original comic book series, The Boys, appear in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-warzone-2-0-season-4-reloaded-the-boys/">Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir operators in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a>, Homelander getting added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-gameplay-trailer-release-date/">Mortal Kombat 1 as a DLC character</a>, but the series has yet to get its own dedicated video game - until now, that is. Sony Pictures VR and Brazilian studio ARVORE have announced The Boys: Trigger Warning, a VR game coming to PS VR2 and Meta Quest 3 in 2026.</p>



<p>The reveal trailer below makes the game feel like a horror title of sorts, with Homelander as the scary monster you're running away from. Which is not entirely off the mark, considering that the show goes to great lengths to make it clear that its version of the world would be a horrifying one to live in, and that people like Homelander are, in fact, monsters.</p>



<p>You step into the shoes of a new original character that is somehow forced into becoming a Supe when a family outing goes awry, and you're exposed to one of the many skeletons buried in Vought's closet.</p>



<p>From there, you join the Boys and plot your revenge on Vought, with cast members from the show, including Laz Alonso as MM (Mother's Milk), Colby Minifie as Homelander's right-hand woman, Ashley Barrett, and P.J. Byrne as Adam Bourke.</p>



<p>Jensen Ackles will also make an appearance in the game as what is described as "<em>a twisted interpretation of Soldier Boy, created exclusively for the game</em>," in a press release. As if Soldier Boy, or any of the super-powered characters in The Boys weren't already twisted enough.</p>

<p>"<em>From day one, we wanted to build an adaptation hand-in-hand with the people who defined this universe</em>," said Ricardo Justus, ARVORE founder and studio head, in a press release. "<em>Working with the show's writers and cast allowed us to bring the edge, humor, and brutality that made the series iconic, delivered with the spark of magic only ARVORE can create</em>."</p>



<p>VR players will recognize ARVORE as the studio behind the Pixel Ripped 1978, 1989, and 1995 games, as well as the studio behind the interactive short The Line and Clawball.</p>

<p>"<em>We're thrilled to work with ARVORE to bring The Boys: Trigger Warning to life in VR</em>," added Lance Sloane, senior vice president of virtual reality at Sony Pictures Entertainment<em> </em>in a press release. "<em>Having the show's creators involved in shaping the experience allows us to push the boundaries of immersive storytelling, and we're grateful to collaborate with our friends at Meta and PlayStation to deliver it to fans</em>."</p>



<p>The fact that the very first video game to be dedicated to The Boys is a VR game is an interesting choice, to say the least. Virtual reality is definitely still growing in popularity, but it's also still quite niche. This does at least explain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-boys-video-game-could-happen-but-maybe-not-how-you-expect/1100-6535645/">why Eric Kripke claimed a video game based on The Boys was happening, but that it wouldn't be a "<em>Xbox or PlayStation</em>" game</a>. It seems that no one told Kripke about the PS VR2 version, though.</p>



<p>It'll also be curious to see how many more members of the cast are featured in Trigger Warning. Homelander makes an appearance in the trailer, though with <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-teaser-voice-not-right/">Anthony Starr not participating in Mortal Kombat 1's rendition of the character,</a> it's probably a safe bet that Starr won't voice Homelander here. </p>



<p>Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Erin Moriarty, and Karen Fukuhara are also absent from the list of confirmed cast members for Trigger Warning, though for at least three of those actors, that could be because their characters don't appear in this original story set within the world of The Boys. We know from the screenshots above that Karl Urban's Billy Butcher does make an appearance, so the fact that Urban isn't mentioned as having already signed on for the game probably means someone else will be voicing Billy.</p>



<p>We'll see if ARVORE can capture what made The Boys such a popular TV show in VR form when it arrives on PS VR2 and Meta Quest 3 at some point in 2026.</p>
