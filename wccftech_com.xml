			<p>Fairgame$ developer Haven Studios has lost its founder, Jade Raymond, a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzM0MzgxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3OTQ4NjE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JOMllUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qOIF32mVNJUCz17mJYYZM-YWpEEYhCcjFt6lm8BeeFo&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj">Bloomberg</a> has revealed. The report also claims Fairgame$ has been delayed out of 2025, and into <strong>spring 2026.</strong></p>
<p>Haven Studios was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-jade-raymond-haven-new-playstation-ip/">announced</a> in 2021, with Raymond making the announcement that she had partnered with PlayStation to form a new team that would be based in Montreal. At the time, Raymond explained that the emphasis behind the studio's name was "<em>to create games that are a haven for players, and we want to build a studio that is a haven for developers.</em>"</p>
<p>A year after that, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-haven-studios-aaa-multiplayer-exclusive-ps5/">PlayStation had acquired Haven Studios</a>, officially bringing it into the PlayStation Studios family, and classifying Haven's debut project as a "<em>AAA multiplayer experience</em>."</p>
<p>A year after that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-new-competitive-heist-experience-fairgame-announced-for-ps5-and-pc/">Fairgame$ was announced</a>, a competitive heist game that has only been showcased through a CGI trailer so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fairgame$ - CGI Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1Jp4K02L1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to Bloomberg's report, Raymond's departure is happening weeks after Fairgame$ went through an external test, and that developers at the studio were "<em>concerned about how the game was received and its progress</em>."</p>
<p>About Raymond's departure, a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg, "<em>Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios. We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter."</em></p>
<p>Bloomberg also notes that the spokesperson said PlayStation is&nbsp;<em>"committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey.</em>" Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski will replace Raymond as co-studio heads.</p>
<p>Before Haven, Raymond made a name for herself as a producer on the Assassin's Creed series at <a href="https://wccftech.com/jade-raymonds-studio-will-build-ac-like-open-world-action-games-for-ea/">Ubisoft</a>, before leaving<a href="https://wccftech.com/jade-raymond-comments-swbfii-lootboxes/"> to establish Motive Studio within EA</a>. After a number of years with EA, she was brought in to Google to help get <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-stadia-first-party-teams-shut-down-jade-raymond-leaves/">Stadia off its feet</a>.&nbsp;And now, the latest chapter in her career has come to an end.</p>
<p>When Sony acquired Haven, former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan was going all-in on live-service games as the future of the PlayStation platform. Since then, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-head-jim-ryan-retires-in-march-2024/">Ryan retired</a>, two of the first-party PlayStation Studios teams Sony had working on live-service games have been shut down (<a href="https://wccftech.com/deviation-games-shuts-down-was-originally-working-on-a-live-service-ip-for-playstation/">Deviation</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">Firewalk</a>), and PlayStation<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-delays-half-of-its-live-service-games-beyond-march-2026/"> has cut down the number of live-service games</a> Ryan originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-confirms-itll-have-10-live-service-games-by-march-2026/">touted</a> the company was going to make.</p>
<p>It's difficult to read Raymond's departure at this stage as anything but a sign that Haven is next to be shut down, meaning it's currently a toss-up whether Fairgame$ even comes out. It also doesn't help that Fairgame$ resembles <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-cancels-hyenas/">another dismally fated heist shooter</a>.</p>

			<p>After so many reassurances that GTA VI would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-march-2025/">arriving in 2025</a>, many players were disappointed to learn that it had been pushed back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26, 2026.</a> But Take-Two chief executive officer Strauss Zelnick feels confident that the delay was absolutely the right choice, and that Rockstar needed the extra time as they continued "<em>seeking perfection</em>" with Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">IGN</a> about the delay, Zelnick admitted that delays cause him "<em>pain</em>," but was resolute that it was the right choice, and that "<em>the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection</em>."</p>
<p>Breaking down what led to the decision, Zelnick said, "<em>A</em><em>s we got closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear, in this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>I feel really good about how Fiscal 26 looks sitting here today</em>," he continued. "<em>And while of course, delays pain me - how could they not? The most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection</em>."</p>
<p>In Zelnick's opening statement for Take-Two's latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3">earnings report</a> for the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, Zelnick says the choice to give Rockstar more time with GTA VI "<em>is a worthy investment</em>."</p>
<p>Rockstar will clearly get all the time it needs, but now that a date has been put out, Zelnick is sounding as confident as he can without having to directly say that GTA VI won't be delayed again.</p>
<p>"<em>I think historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it,</em>" is what he told IGN. When asked by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-id-argue-rockstar-has">The Game Business</a> about announcing the date a year in advance, Zelnick said, "<em>Generally, when we set a specific date, that ends up being the date</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We thought it was important to reassure people that it is coming, and picking a specific date emphasizes that point,</em>" he continued.</p>
<p>So we can look towards May 26, 2026, with at least a bit more confidence than we could at the previous 'release window' of sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>Zelnick has previously cited Rockstar and Take-Two's goals for GTA VI, saying that the company is trying to make GTA VI the next "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-development-benchmark/"><em>benchmark</em></a>" for video games and entertainment, that Rockstar is going for "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-never-seen-before-perfection/"><em>something you've never seen before</em>,</a>" and that Take-Two and Rockstar Games are "<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-seeks-perfection-says-take-two-ceo-as-updated-forecast-hints-at-fy-2026-launch-window/"><em>seeking perfection</em></a>" with this release.</p>

<p>He's always publicly set the highest bar imaginable for Grand Theft Auto VI, and this is no different. While what we've seen of the game makes it <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-early-comparison-massive-jump/">appear to be hitting that bar</a>, we won't know for sure until it's in our hands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-development-on-grand-theft-auto-vi-only-began-in-earnest-in-2020/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI has been one of the video game industry's most anticipated games for at least half the dozen years since Grand Theft Auto V first released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Rockstar has obviously had its next mainline entry on its mind for (at least) all 12 years since GTA V, but according to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick, development on GTA VI only began "<em>in earnest</em>" in <strong>2020</strong>.</p>
<p>In Zelnick's opening statement for Take-Two's latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3">earnings report</a> for the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, he reveals that "<em>Grand Theft Auto VI began development in earnest in 2020 following the massive success of Red Dead Redemption 2,</em>" before going on to discuss how highly anticipated the game is and that the<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-2-breaks-all-time-24h-viewership-records-beating-deadpool-vs-wolverine/"> new trailer broke records again.</a> During the Q/A portion of <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir">today's presentation</a>, while talking about the trailer's traffic in response to a question, he said that Rockstar "<em>broke the internet, again.</em>"</p>
<p>Which is no surprise when you look at that trailer. It was<a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/"> incredibly impressive</a>, and the fact that it took Rockstar six years of focused production time to achieve what we've seen so far is a testament to just how incredibly talented the developers and designers at Rockstar are.</p>
<p>Six years isn't the total development time, though, as Zelnick's specification that work began "<em>in earnest</em>" in 2020 implies that pre-production and earlier stages work was going on prior. It's even possible that people at Rockstar moved to work on Grand Theft Auto VI days after Red Dead Redemption 2 launched, putting a more total estimate for GTA VI's development time at eight years, at least.</p>
<p>With at least eight years of development behind it, and nearly 13 years of waiting (if it hits May 2026) for GTA fans, expectations for GTA VI feel higher than they've been for any game. Its closest comparison, you could argue, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-apologizes-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-xb1-performance-promises-patches-are-inbound/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which is a release we'll all never forget for very negative reasons. Let's hope for a different outcome this time.</p>

			<p>Obsidian has <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1923067990796361892">announced</a> the 2025 roadmap for Avowed, which consists of three big updates for the rest of the year, the first of which is out now with update 1.4.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, Avowed will include a new game-plus mode, a photo mode, NPCs will have new abilities and behaviors, players will get new character presets, Godlike features, weapons, and the ability to change your appearance in the world. But that's all to come in the Summer and Fall 2025 updates.</p>
<p>As for today's Spring 2025 update with patch 1.4, Obsidian has added an arachnophobia mode, mouse and keyboard support for Xbox console players, fog of war improvements, more gold and crafting materials, and a slew of bug fixes and other tweaks that Obsidian gets into in the<a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-14-notes/"> full patch notes</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/1-4-update">blog post</a> about the roadmap and today's update on its website, Obsidian also called out that it is working to add localized language versions of Avowed for Korean, Japanese, and French-speaking players. The studio doesn't say when those versions will be available, but is "<em>committed to delivering these updates as soon as they are ready, and we deeply appreciate your patience and support as we make sure they meet the quality you deserve.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo</a> enjoyed Avowed when it arrived earlier this year, saying in his review that Avowed "<em>marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds</em>."</p>
<p>And soon we'll know just how significant it is with direct comparison to Obsidian's next game, The Outer Worlds 2, which is due to release in 2025.</p>
