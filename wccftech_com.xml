			<p>Today, publisher Kakao Games announced that the upcoming fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-ue5-mmorpg-gets-striking-gameplay-trailer-confirmed-for-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a> will soon be playable in a limited-time PC Closed Beta Test available next month <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873440/Chrono_Odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>. You can simply request access from the store page for a chance to be invited.</p>
<p>We hadn't heard from South Korean developer Chrono Studio in some time. The latest trailer was released during the Game Developers Conference 2024, which took place in March of that year. Afterward, we only got information about the release window from the publisher's schedule, which pointed <a href="https://wccftech.com/ue5-action-mmorpgs-archeage-chronicles-and-chrono-odyssey-dated-for-q4-2025-and-fy-2026-respectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a late 2025 debut of the game</a> (while ArcheAge Chronicles was moved to 2026). Still, that was around six months ago. It may well be that things have changed, and in any case, the CBT's feedback will be crucial to determine when the game will be released.</p>
<p>Sangtae Yoon, executive producer of Chrono Odyssey, stated:</p>
<p><em>Chrono Odyssey represents years of passion and innovation. This closed beta is our invitation to players worldwide to help shape the future of this ambitious project. We cannot wait to play alongside you, experience the story, and see what each and every one of you think of our game.</em></p>

<p>As hinted by the game's title, Chrono Odyssey allows players to wield time-manipulation powers. That includes combat, which will feature powers like Time Rewind and Dodge. In the beta, players can select three of the six classes featured in the final game: Swordsman, Ranger, and Berserker. Each has its own unique skill tree.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game also promises near-instantaneous world transitions, a seamless and detailed world, dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and ever-shifting terrain shaped by temporal rifts.</p>
<p>The full game will also include standard MMORPG content such as dungeons, raids, and PvP, as well as activities like harvesting, logging, mining, and skinning.</p>
<p>Despite having been made with UE5, the system requirements listed on Steam are fairly low:</p>

			<p>New early Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 comparison videos were shared online over the weekend, highlighting how the upcoming new version of the game holds up surprisingly well compared to other versions.</p>
<p>The new comparison videos, which were put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BluntyTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blunty</a>, compare the latest high-quality footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version which was shared by developer CD Projekt Red itself after providing it for a round of<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-footage-underestimated/"> Japanese previews</a>, featuring the same sequences seen in the footage recreated on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and on an ROG Ally that simulates the Steam Deck specs. While the new version of the game clearly loses to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions in terms of graphics and performance, it holds up extremely well to them, considering we are talking about handheld hardware. In the comparison with the simulated Steam Deck specs, the Nintendo Switch 2 version fares better, although that is to be expected, considering the game is presumably running in docked mode in the footage, so handheld mode footage will be needed for a proper comparison, which may not be made available in high-quality before launch.</p>

<p>Despite being available for five years now, Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 has quickly become one of the most anticipated launch games for the system. It will likely set a pretty high bar in terms of multiplatform ports on it. CD Projekt Red has put <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">incredible care</a> into this new version of the game, not wanting a repeat of the launch fiasco on previous generation consoles, and it definitely shows.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most of the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bethesda-shows-even-more-support-to-the-skyblivion-mod-team-hosts-them-at-rockville-headquarters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda showed even more support to the Skyblivion mod team, and invited them to tour Bethesda Studios headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. The Skyblivion team shared the excursion with <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1923793664112726161">a post on X</a>, with photos from the studio and with developers from Bethesda, including Todd Howard, thanking the studio for having them and showing them around.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you to our friends Bethesda Studios for having us over and showing us around!</em>" the post reads. "<em>Meeting the legendary people behind some of our favorite games was incredible and was only matched by their shared enthusiasm for Skyblivion and the modding community</em>."</p>
<p>It's the latest show of support after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">Bethesda gifted the entire Skyblivion team game keys</a> for the recently released Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p>If you weren't aware, Skyblivion is a total conversion mod effort to take The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and recreate it in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It's been in development for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/">more than eight years</a>, and is finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">due to release sometime in 202</a>5, though it'll just be the base Oblivion game on launch, with the Oblivion DLCs due to come sometime later.</p>
<p>When the Oblivion Remaster was first spotted online, ahead of it being officially revealed, Wccftech reached out to the Skyblivion team, who had no ill-will towards the work that Bethesda was doing in its own remastering of Oblivion.</p>
<p>"<em>For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster,</em>" said the Skyblivion team lead Rebelzize.</p>
<p>"<em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different from what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing [Skyblivion] was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all.</em>"</p>
