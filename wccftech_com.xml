			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxf3j7pyoc26">reported</a> the July 2025 sales numbers for the United States based on dollar sales from physical and digital game and hardware sales, revealing that the Nintendo Switch 2 has hit a new sales milestone in the US, while EA Sports College Football 26, somewhat unsurprisingly, absolutely dominates the sales charts for premium game sales.</p>



<p>After Nintendo's last quarterly report showed the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling through 6 million units globally</a>, Piscatella reveals the console's latest regional milestone, that it has now gone beyond 2 million units sold in the US alone. It was also the best-selling piece of video game hardware for July 2025, both in dollar sales and units sold, and just as impressively, the Switch 2 is outpacing the Nintendo Switch by 75% in the US during the same window when the Nintendo Switch launched in 2017.</p>







<p>Moving onto software, EA Sports College Football 26 won in July, taking the top spot for premium game sales across all platforms in the US for the month. Though it was also a win for Madden NFL 26, even though that game only released earlier this month on August 14. EA offered players an MVP bundle which gets you both College Football 26 and Madden NFL 26, and the MVP bundle was the second-best-selling premium title, behind players just getting College Football 26.</p>







<p>In fact, the bundle sold so strongly, as did College Football 26, that both have joined the list of top-20 best-selling games in the US for 2025, with College Football 26 shooting all the way up to third place behind Oblivion Remastered and Monster Hunter Wilds. The MVP bundle made the list in the number 12 spot.</p>







<p>Other notable entries on the software charts include <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which was able to grab third place for game sales in the US in July 2025, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, which came in at fourth place.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/">Grounded 2</a> was also able to make the charts, but in eighth place when you're looking at premium sales on all platforms. It had a much more impressive top spot when you silo everything down to just PC game sales in the US for July, where it overtook Elden Ring Nightreign, though Nightreign remained at number two.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 still has a ways to go if it is going to hit the <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">15 million units sold number that analysts predict it'll reach before 2025 is over</a>, but having already surpassed 6 million globally, 2 million of that being in the US alone, and it's not even holiday season, all point to it at least getting close. We'll see how the rest of the year unfolds. </p>

			<p>Hello Games has just dropped another massive, and of course, free, update for No Man's Sky with the release of its Voyagers update, and version 6.0 of the game that first launched on PC and PS4 all the way back in 2016.</p>



<p>One of the key elements of this new update is how Hello Games has rebuilt the way ship building works in the game, as you can now build completely custom ships that you can walk around in, decorate how you like, filling each of the various rooms with your friends and fellow explorers, and jump out into space from to enjoy the vastness of the universe if you find yourself in a particularly pretty part of space.</p>

<p>After recently releasing No Man's Sky on <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massively-improved-switch-2-version-lets-you-be-a-towns-mayor/">Nintendo Switch 2,</a> Hello Games founder Sean Murray and the rest of the studio have made it clear they're seemingly nowhere done with updates for the game, with Voyagers now No Man's Sky's 39th named update since its historic launch. "<em></em><em>I can’t believe it’s been just over nine years since No Man’s Sky first launched</em>," Murray said in a press release. Frankly, considering how different, yet similar, the game looks, neither can we.</p>



<p>Murray continues by detailing some of what's possible with Voyagers and how players can approach ship building in this new update. "<em>We call them Corvettes, huge ships with hulls, wings, landing gear, cockpits, engine parts, thrusters and more - arranged to your own unique sci-fi design,"</em> he says. "<em>These ships have real interiors, med-bays, sleeping quarters, war rooms, radars, teleporters. It comes with you everywhere, which totally changes how you play. Decorating it with your friends gives you a space that you share together. Whether it's a brightly coloured tiny explorer, or a colossal dark metallic war ship, it allows you to show off your own personality.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Adding bigger weapons to your Corvette increases your firepower. Add sleeping quarters and a mission radar, and you are ready to welcome a crew of friends on board. Add a mission radar and you are ready to adventure. A teleporter and you have an away team. Or just a window… and suddenly there are these special moments, watching as the universe flies by outside at warp speed.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>He also reminds players, just in case they've forgotten, that all the tech Hello Games is building for No Man's Sky is also being built for <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/">Light No Fire,</a> the next ambitious project from the studio that, instead of giving you a whole universe to explore, will charge you with exploring one large, Earth-sized, detailed planet. It's a whole new kind of challenge, and it is one of the most anticipated titles in the video game landscape.</p>



<p>"<em>I can’t believe that in the past 12 months we released Worlds Part I, Worlds Part II, and Voyagers - all huge changes to this game we care about so much</em>," Murray added. "<em>Many thanks for any support you continue to provide our little game. It really helps us continue to do what we do.</em>"</p>



<p>Voyagers is now available for No Man's Sky players on all platforms.</p>
