			<p>FromSoftware and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20251023_eldenring_tarnishededition_postponement">announced today in a press release</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring, titled Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, will no longer be released in 2025 and has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>A statement from FromSoftware cites the reason for the delay as the game needing more time "<em>for game performance adjustments</em>." A more specific release window beyond 2026 was not provided.</p>



<p>"<em>While development is progressing wholeheartedly towards release</em>," the statement begins, "<em>it was deemed that more time is required for game performance adjustments and the decision to change the release date was made.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Further announcements will follow once a specific release date has been determined. We offer our sincere apologies for inconveniencing players who have been eagerly awaiting the release of this title. Thank you for your patience and support as we continue to make performance adjustments</em>."</p>



<p>Frankly, this delay isn't the biggest surprise. Besides the fact that the quality bar for technical performance in FromSoftware games is rocky at best, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">there were already reasonable concerns</a> with how this new version would run on the Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, it's more powerful than the first Switch and definitely has a shot at running Elden Ring with some degree of stability, but it's no surprise to learn that FromSoftware needs more time to try and figure that out.</p>



<p>And based on their track record, even when it arrives it'll likely do so with its fair share of performance issues anyways. Of course, we hope that's not the case, but FromSoftware can't even put out games on current-gen consoles and PCs without significant performance issues.</p>



<p>Elden Ring also isn't the only major title that won't be hitting its initial 2025 release window on Nintendo Switch 2. Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">recently delayed indefinitely,</a> while Gearbox continues to fix and resolve the performance issues the game had on other platforms and addressing what we can only assume to be serious performance issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, if you want to take Elden Ring with you on the go, the only option remains PC handhelds like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck </a>or the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>
