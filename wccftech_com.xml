			<p>Amazon is laying off more than 14,000 corporate jobs today, and per a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTY2Nzc5MywiZXhwIjoxNzYyMjcyNTkzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNFVOSThHUTdMSEIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.gpW2CyZmAypCDjxGr-gBHrW6EnUxZkFspCrjiLV-dwc">Bloomberg</a>, the video games division, Amazon Game Studios, is not immune to the cuts.</p>



<p>While Amazon doesn't specify exactly how many people from its video games division will be laid off, a statement from Steve Boom, Amazon's head of audio, Twitch, and games, does call the cut "<em>significant</em>," and says that the cuts are happening despite Amazon being "<em>proud</em>" of the success it has had. While the studio's MMO, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/">New World</a>, isn't mentioned by name, the statement does say that Amazon is halting its game development work "<em>specifically around MMOs</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>While we're proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing</em>," the statement reads, "<em>we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work - specifically around MMOs - within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in or studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team</em>."</p>







<p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807825/amazon-job-layoffs-2025-ai">The Verge</a> adds that the driving force behind these cuts comes from Amazon pushing further into AI, with senior executive Beth Galetti writing in a memo to staff, "<em>The reductions we’re sharing today are a continuation of this work to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well</em>. <em>This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly</em>."</p>



<p>While Amazon calls out MMOs as the genre it is specifically halting work in, it's unclear if the company will move forward in other areas of game development and publishing. Or, this could be the first major sign that Amazon is getting out of games entirely, and will stick to producing TV and film adaptations of video game properties, like its highly popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/">Fallout series</a> and upcoming series adaptations of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a>.</p>

			<p>Zack Fair's gameplay in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is set to be significantly expanded by a new mod introducing new mechanics and skill for an overhauled combat experience.</p>



<p>This Zack gameplay overhaul mod is being developed by NSK, the modder behind the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/658">Zack and Sephiroth Combat Fix mod</a> whichaddressed some issues for the two characters and expanded their possibilities when added to the regular combat party outside their small playable segments. </p>



<p>Judging from the video showcase shared a few days ago on YouTube, the changes being made to Zack's gameplay are going to be significant, leveraging his unique Charge mechanics in some very interesting ways while adding some new skills, which include offensive skills that change depending on the Charge level, new Limit Break extensions, changes to existing abilities like High Braver, new combo routes and more. </p>



<p>As the character felt somewhat basic to use, despite some of his unique mechanics, these changes are set to be extremely welcome, providing PC players with one more reason to return to the game and experience it with some new features, although some of the changes could potentially break the game balance in some ways, especially if Zack is fighting with a full party, and not by himself as shown in the video below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has expanded Zack's role beyond the original, it will be very interesting to see whether the character will return in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's sequel, and how his gameplay will evolve past the foundation set in the second episode of the trilogy if he does. Thankfully, it should take much longer to learn more about a game that is <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">coming along really wel</a>l, and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">that should satisfy old and new fans alike.</a></p>



<p>Before the third part of the trilogy launches, Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2 owners will finally get to experience both Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth in the future. <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">The first entry in the trilogy will hit both systems on January 22, 2026.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-now-live-full-season-1-roadmap-revealed.1337008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's a big day for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, with both its Season 1 update now live for players to jump into, and its new free-to-play battle royale mode, Battlefield REDSEC, also now available. EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed yesterday what was already rumored, that REDSEC would be revealed and launched today, and now it's here for all players on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Once the gameplay trailer that was teased yesterday was over, the mode and the new season was officially live for all players to jump into, and we got our first major question of the day answered. Battlefield REDSEC can be accessed as an added DLC through Battlefield 6 and will be available in the menu for players who already own the game and have it downloaded. </p>



<p>If you don't already own Battlefield 6, then when you go to download REDSEC, you'll have to access it through Battlefield 6. At least for now, EA and Battlefield Studios have not broken it off into a separate app.</p>



<p>We also learned that the roadmap shared earlier this year was not at all the complete roadmap, which has now been shared along with the release of REDSEC and Season 1.</p>

<p>On top of the new game modes and the new Conquest map, Blackwell Ridge, that arrives in Battlefield 6 with Season 1 today (<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">which you can learn more about in our Season 1 preview</a>), REDSEC arrives with two different game modes: a core battle royale mode and a multiplayer-inspired mode, Gauntlet.</p>



<p>Both modes are set on one map called Fort Lyndon, a government testing ground that is basically your own personal battlefield for REDSEC and its two modes. The battle royale mode is your bog-standard battle royale of 100 players entering a map that continuously gets smaller with a toxic circle pushing everyone to one area, and the last squad standing wins. Squads can be either two or four players, with no solo queue available at launch.</p>



<p>You'll decide on your class and sidearm before dropping in, and acquire the rest of your loadout during the match, including primary weapons, gadgets, etc. It's even possible to find keycards that'll grant access to vehicles like tanks, though they come with limited fuel and ammo.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield REDSEC Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn8k1g3vMDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new Gauntlet mode is a "<em>knockout-style</em>" mode with eight squads entering the fray, each trying to complete a set of missions to end up on top.</p>



<p>"<em>Every Gauntlet 'round' is a different mode or 'missions,' such as Deadlock, a multi-team variant of King of the</em> <em>Hill, or Wreckage, which is similar to Rush,</em>" the Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-full-roadmap">website reads in its explanation of Gauntlet</a>. "<em>With eight mission types and numerous Combat Zones, it is incredibly rare to have the exact same Gauntlet mission sequence in back-to-back matches.</em>"</p>



<p>You'll also be able to create your own versions of REDSEC through Portal, which can let you really up the ante and adjust REDSEC to create whatever crazed and chaotic version of REDSEC you want for both the core battle royale mode and Gauntlet.</p>



<p>It's also worth mentioning that the first battle pass for Battlefield 6 is now live for players to start working their way through. Of course, you can mostly ignore the battle pass if you're not a fan of the weapon and character skins it is mostly filled with, but you will have to work through them if you want to unlock the new weapons like the SOR-300SC carbine or the new Mini-Scout sniper rifle.</p>



<p>Beyond that, it's exciting to see REDSEC now live for players to try out, and it'll be interesting to see what players think of it as we get ever closer to a new year of Call of Duty and Warzone. We'll have a better idea by the end of the year if REDSEC can stand up to Warzone and keep players interested.</p>



<p>And for EA and Battlefield Studios sake, hopefully today's launch doesn't also come with a slew of technical issues.</p>
