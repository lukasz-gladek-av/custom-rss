			<p>This morning saw the debut of the story trailer for Alien: Rogue Incursion by <a href="https://wccftech.com/aliens-single-player-unreal-engine-5-game-survios-announced-pc-console-vr/">Survios, a leading VR developer</a>. They've created numerous award-winning VR games, such as Spirit Vector, Electronauts, and Zombies on the Holodeck. Their last game, Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions, was released in 2021 as a non-VR game, and now they're back to dip their toes into the VR pool. Alien: Rogue Incursion is set to release on December 19, 2024, on PlayStation VR2 and SteamVR. Those who use Meta platforms will have access to the game in early 2025, but the date for it isn't set in stone just yet. If you want to see what you can expect from Alien: Rogue Incursion, make sure to check out the story trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion | Story Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e69rk-zwZvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this upcoming title, you follow the story of ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks and her AI companion Davis 01, as they have to undertake a life threatening mission into an infested research facility on planet Purdan. For those who are interested in the game, you can get an exclusive weapon and armor skin inspired by Alien: Romulus if you pre-order now. Additionally, for those who want a few more extra goodies, you can get the Deluxe Edition which comes with Blue Camo Armor and Weapon skins, as well as a digital artbook of Alien: Rogue Incursion. If you want to pre-order this title, you can get the Standard Edition of Alien: Rogue Incursion for $39.99, with the Deluxe Edition costing $49.99.</p>
<p>More details about Alien: Rogue incursion have been posted to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/alien-rogue-incursion-new-story-trailer-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation blog</a> by TQ Jefferson, the Chief Product Officer at Survios. In this post, he announces that the game has officially gone gold ahead of its release date next month, as well as the breakdown of how they created the trailer to immerse those interested in the game.</p>
<p>In the post, Jefferson goes on to mention that the Alien: Rogue Incursion trailer follows a classic three-act structure, with each act having a particular focus. Whether this means that the game has the same sort of structure is uncertain. The trailer introduces viewers to Zula and Davis 01, where they begin their journey into exploring the facility. As the trailer reaches act two, "we weave in classic Alien themes like corporate corruption, personal greed, and professional hubris, all of which create a perfect storm of conditions for a Xenomorph outbreak."</p>
<p>There are some traditional weapons that players will get access to, such as the M41 Prototype Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, and, of course, the Motion Tracker. If you're a horror nerd or really enjoy the Alien movies, check this game out when it releases on December 19, 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the official nominations for the Game of the Year category at The Game Awards 2024 have been <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1858558285995241601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1858558285995241601%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a>, and the biggest news is that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was included. This is surprising because Shadow of the Erdtree is not a standalone game but a DLC that requires Elden Ring to be played.</p>
<p>Since this is unprecedented, The Game Awards organization clarified its stance on the topic with a newly added FAQ on the event's official <a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration.</em></p>
<p>It's fair game for everyone, then, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is the obvious favorite in an otherwise less-than-outstanding year. FromSoftware's admittedly large DLC (according to HowLongToBeat, it takes 25.5 hours for the main quest but over 50 hours for a completionist run) will have to beat Atlus's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Square Enix's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, Team Asobi's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>, and PlayStack's Balatro to repeat the 2022 win of the base game. It shouldn't be too hard, although on paper, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is tied with Astro Bot and Metaphor: ReFantazio when it comes to Metacritic score (94 for all three). However, FromSoftware's latest masterpiece is far more popular, as evidenced by the larger sales.</p>
<p>The DLC got a perfect score here on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo. Here's the summarized take from his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>It did not take long to get back into the engaging adventuring loop of the Elden Ring experience, searching for map fragments to get a better look at the map, placing markers where points of interest are seemingly located, and getting amazed by beautiful vistas, immense castles, and sprawling haunting forests, unaware of the dangers that lurked inside of them. With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>
<p>You can vote for your favorite game on the official The Game Awards website. The ceremony will go live on December 12 at 5 PM Pacific.</p>

			<p>The implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler isn't perfect in all titles due to some games reportedly using an older version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>Commenting on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/df-star-wars-jedi-survivor-ps5-pro-severe-image-quality-problems-but-rt-in-performance-mode-is-nice.1038024/page-4#post-131783178"> ResetERA forums</a> in a thread discussing the disappointing Star Wars Jedi: Survivor PS5 Pro update, a developer going by the name of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/koralsky.22833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koralsky</a> commented on the poor image quality produced by PSSR in certain titles, revealing that the difference in image quality between different games is caused by the different versions of the upscaler used. In regard to the latest entry in the Respawn series, the developer confirmed the game is using SDK 9, being an Unreal Engine 4 game, so the team couldn't implement the latest up-to-date version of the upscaler that requires SDK 10 or higher, and has possibly used the very first version, hence the bad image quality.</p>
<p>While Koralsky couldn't provide more details on how many iterations of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler are already available and how each version improves on the previous, they could confirm that users should expect IQ improvements in the second and third batches of PS5 Pro-supported games using PSSR. In a game the developer is currently working on, for example, one of the later versions of PSSR, but not the latest, is giving much better results in comparison to TSR and FSR, and, as such, they expect the upscaler to get in a much better state in six, twelve months, compared to the state it is in the first batch of PS5 Pro supported titles.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro console is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the recently released mid-generation system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>
