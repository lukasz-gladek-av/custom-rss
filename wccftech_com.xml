			<p>The first look at a never-before-seen Battlefield 6 map has been provided today by a new leaked video.</p>



<p>The video, which has been shared by the same user who provided the first look at the game's Battle Royale map yesterday, showcases the Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm map, a mostly flat map featuring a unique atmosphere. Sadly, the player doesn't do a very good job showcasing the map in full due to their playstyle and high FOV settings, but those eagerly anticipating the game's release next month will surely appreciate taking a look at a map that will supposedly be part of the game's very first season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although it took EA and the many development teams working on the game to unveil it, the long wait hasn't damped the excitement surrounding Battlefield 6, as proven by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">incredible numbers</a> pulled by the open beta held last month. Some data gleaned from the testing phases also revealed how many PC users taking part in the test ran the beta client on minimum specs and lower, highlighting the need to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">optimize for weaker systems</a> to allow as many users as possible to enjoy the game as intended. With this being one of the focuses of the developers, it was not surprising to hear the game won't support ray tracing and likely never will, to focus on performance, which is definitely the right choice for a competitive shooter.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10.</p>

			<p>Sales of Monster Hunter Wilds have been impacted by the high price of the PlayStation 5, and not by any issue the game may have, according to CAPCOM's president Haruhiro Tsujimoto.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5s-steep-price-a-barrier-for-potential-monster-hunter-wilds-players-capcom-president-says/">Automaton</a>, Tsujimoto-san talked with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Nikkei Gaming</a> about the sales of the latest entry in one of the most popular gaming franchises ever, which were quite strong at launch, but fell off quickly in the following months, saying that the high price of the PlayStation 5, which the publisher considers the main platform for the game, has impacted its performance on the market. Taking into consideration the price of the system, accessories and the PlayStation Plus subscription required to play online, plus the price of the game, getting to play Monster Hunter Wilds can be costly, especially for young players with no income, so it would make more sense for some of them to get previous entries in the series featuring a lot more content like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a> which can be purchased for far less. As such, the biggest challenge for the publisher will be to make the game as accessible as possible to new players, and it is planning a strategy to take advantage of future discounts to improve sales starting in these final months of the year.</p>



<p>In the same interview, the CAPCOM's president also commented on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, saying that the system's success was better than the publisher expected, highlighting its lower price compared to Sony's system. The succcess of the new Nintendo console reaffirmed how cost-conscious users are all over the world, Tsujimoto-san commented.</p>



<p>It's a shame Monster Hunter Wilds is not proving to be as successful as past entries in the series, as the game is a more than worthy entry in the series, even with its issues, such as the low challenge level which the development team has been addressing with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">free updates and content</a>. You can learn more about the game now out on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

			<p>As part of the celebrations for the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Ubisoft has confirmed that Ubisoft Milan, which was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to be working on a new installment of the franchise, is partnering with Ubisoft Montpellier on this project.</p>



<p>Loic Gounon, Brand Producer for the IP, <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595264390218129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a video message</a>:</p>



<p><em>A bit about myself: I joined Ubisoft twenty years ago, and I've been on the franchise since 2006 on projects such as Rayman Raving Rabbids, Rayman Origins, and Rayman Legends. Rayman was born at Ubisoft Montpellier back in 1995, and for the past thirty years, he has gone on many adventures thanks to studios across the world</em> <em>like Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Milan, or Ubisoft Annecy. Starting now and across our community channels, we are taking a moment to celebrate this incredible history by looking back. We will be sharing behind the scenes, anecdotes, developer interviews, concept art, and more throughout the months to come. Rayman couldn't have become such a legend without all of you, the fans. You have helped to keep his legacy going, and we're incredibly thankful for that. As we said in the past, a very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working together on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands.</em></p>



<p>Fans of the peculiar limbless creature must arm themselves with a lot of patience, as triple-A game development can take a very long time these days. The only tidbit we have on the project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-remake-prince-of-persia-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a rumor</a> that circulated last October, when Insider Gaming said this would be a remake of a prior title. Tom Henderson is usually extremely well informed when it comes to Ubisoft, so it's likely that the info is correct and a remake, rather than a new game, is on the way.</p>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Type</h5><p><span>Wireless gaming headset</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Price</h5><p><span>$119.99 (currently discounted to $89.99)</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Corsair’s Void line has been among my favorites for some time now —solid gaming audio, cool looks, and a price that doesn’t make my wallet cry. The Corsair Void Wireless v2, priced at $119.99, steps up from the old Void RGB Elite Wireless with a featherlight design, a mic that’s ready for prime time, and battery life that just keeps going. It’s got some quirks, especially for console players, but for PC gamers, this thing’s a steal. Let’s dive in and see what it’s packing.</p>



<p><strong>Design and features</strong></p>



<p>The Void Wireless v2 rocks that bold, angular Void style—like something out of a sci-fi flick. Available in Carbon or White, it’s got RGB strips on the earcups you can tweak via Corsair’s iCUE software. It’s not subtle, but I’m here for it. At just 303g, this headset is crazy light, making it a dream for long sessions. The microfiber mesh earpads and memory foam headband feel soft and breathable, and the adjustable headband keeps it snug without squeezing your head.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Controls live on the left earcup: a power button (which also swaps between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth), a programmable button, and a volume rocker you can tap for custom tricks in iCUE. The non-detachable mic is super flexible, with enough adjustment options. Flip-to-mute is a nice touch, and the build feels solid, though the plastic-heavy frame doesn’t scream “luxury” like Corsair’s high-end stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<p><span>Comfort</span><br>At 303g, the Void Wireless v2 is like wearing nothing at all. I’ve rocked it through marathons, and my ears stayed cool thanks to the breathable mesh and plush foam. Glasses-wearers like me will love the light clamping force, though the earcups can feel a bit small, sometimes brushing my ears. It’s not perfect, but it’s comfortable enough for the price.</p>



<p><span>Connectivity</span><br>This headset’s got flexibility for days: low-latency 2.4GHz wireless via a USB-A dongle (50ft range, no dropouts) and Bluetooth for phones, Switch, or other devices. Flipping between modes is as easy as tapping the power button. It works on PC, PS4, PS5, and Mac, but Xbox gamers are out of luck with this one. Additionally, there's no wired option, so be sure to stay on top of the juice left in the battery. Still, Bluetooth makes this a solid pick for bouncing between PC and mobile.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><span>Sound Quality</span><br>The 50mm neodymium drivers (20Hz–20kHz) deliver punchy, clear audio that’s great for gaming. Bass thumps in DOOM, and mids keep footsteps and callouts crisp in Rainbow Six Siege. Dolby Atmos on PC adds some immersive flair, but it’s not gonna blow your mind. For gaming and movies, it’s spot-on, but music fans might notice the highs lack a bit of sparkle compared to pricier headsets like the Virtuoso XT. It’s not the best audio out there, but for $120, it gets the job done. Console players, heads-up: you’re locked into the default sound without iCUE.</p>



<p><span>Microphone</span><br>The mic is a straight-up star. It’s omnidirectional, Discord-certified, and picks up your voice clean and clear (-40dB sensitivity). The flexible boom lets you tweak its position to perfection, and flip-to-mute is a lifesaver for quick silences. With the foam windscreen and NVIDIA Broadcast support on PC, it’s great for team comms or casual streaming. It won’t replace a dedicated USB mic, but it’s one of the best I’ve tested at this price.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><span>Battery Life</span><br>Corsair claims 70 hours on 2.4GHz and 130 hours on Bluetooth, and I’m not arguing. I got around 65 hours with RGB off, and a 15-minute charge gave me ~6 hours of juice. Compared to the old Void’s 16 hours, this is next-level. Even with RGB cranked, it lasts longer than most competitors. The USB-C cable makes charging quick and painless.</p>



<p><span>iCUE Software</span><br>iCUE is where PC gamers get the good stuff: RGB tweaking, a 10-band EQ, Dolby Atmos, and button remapping. It’s slick but can be a bit laggy, and console players get none of this magic, which is disappointing. Also, the EQ preset cycling just says “1,” “2,” and so on—no names like “FPS” or “Movie.” It’s a small gripe, but it bugs me when I’m swapping settings blind.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The Corsair Void Wireless v2 is a banger at $119.99. It’s quite comfortable, the mic’s a beast, and the battery life is basically immortal. Sound’s great for gaming, with Dolby Atmos adding some spice, though music snobs might want more. Bluetooth makes it super versatile, but the lack of wired connectivity and iCUE’s PC-only perks mean console gamers miss out on the full package. Compared to the Sony Wireless Gold 7.1 ($85) or Turtle Beach Stealth 600 ($100), it’s got a better mic and battery life, but PS5 players might want more on-headset control. If you’re a PC gamer living in iCUE, this headset’s a no-brainer. Console folks, you might wanna shop around unless you’re cool with basic audio. Either way, the Void Wireless v2 is a solid step up from its predecessor and an excellent pick for the price.</p>
