			<p>Right now, there's a big air of mystery around <strong>MachineGames</strong>, and what its next project will be. The developer is mostly known for its take on the <strong>Wolfenstein</strong> series; its last game, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></strong>, meant it took several years off from the Wolfenstein franchise to make a different kind of excellent Nazi-punching adventure.</p>



<p>But now that its treasure-hunting adventure is out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/">with its own DLC</a>, and will soon be <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-trio-of-bethesda-ports-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-fallout-4-indiana-jones-and-oblivion-remastered/">available on the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a>, the question once again becomes: what's next for MachineGames? Presumably, what's next is <strong>Wolfenstein 3</strong>, and in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, MachineGames studio director, <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong>, reiterated that, yes, MachineGames will make Wolfenstein 3 one day, even if it's not the studio's next immediate project.</p>



<p>"<em>Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein,</em>" Gustafsson says. "<em>We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. <strong>It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>It's a similar sentiment Gustafsson has shared before. Last September, as part of a NoClip documentary digging into the making of Wolfenstein, Gustafsson confirmed that the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">"<em>always seen this [Wolfenstein] as a trilogy</em>," adding that the studio has "<em>a story to tell</em>" for BJ Blazkowicz</a>.</p>



<p>And last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/">reports from Windows Central and Kotaku pointed to <strong>Wolfenstein 3 already being in development</strong></a>, though it's unclear what stage of development the game is in. Gustafsson's comments in this interview with GI.Biz are further evidence that the studio isn't done with Wolfenstein, but it does introduce the potential that the next game we see from MachineGames won't be the third entry in its mainline Wolfenstein series.</p>



<p>That said, it's still likely a game within the Wolfenstein franchise, especially if <strong>Microsoft</strong> and MachineGames want to try and line it up with the development of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein TV show currently in the works at <strong>Amazon MGM Studios</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Two years ago, a rumour appeared pointing to the studio making something that<a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-unannounced-game/"> was neither Indiana Jones nor the next entry in BJ Blazkowicz's story.</a> Its next project could be that rumoured game, if that game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-might-have-canceled-an-unannounced-project/">wasn't the same one that was reportedly cancelled last year</a></strong>. </p>



<p>Hopefully, it's not too much longer before we learn what the studio is working on, even though it currently doesn't seem like the studio will have something ready for 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-schedule-halo-summer-kiln-april-new-controller/">if the rumours around what Xbox has planned for the year are true</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-players-can-prepare-for-the-second-expedition-with-a-new-catch-up-mechanic-and-lowered-stash-value-requirements/</link>

			<p>One mechanic that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> uses to keep players engaged in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> is the game's <strong>Expeditions</strong>, which are essentially a big reset for your Raider. Things like your Workshop, player level, skill points, blueprints, coins, quests, and stash upgrade progress all get reset, letting you start again with new rewards and buffs to make your next round of Topside visits all the more intriguing.</p>



<p>What makes Expeditions interesting to complete (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-dominance-continues-reportedly-stands-as-top-selling-game-across-steam-xbox-and-playstation-for-third-consecutive-month/">and what helps keep players logging onto ARC Raiders each day</a>) is that you have a limited amount of time to prepare for them, with Expeditions running on a tight, 60-day schedule, as you prepare the necessary resources to embark on one. Players will be able to head out on the game's first Expedition since it launched on <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> with the deadline to sign up for it being <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of that, and ahead of the game's second Expedition, Embark has introduced a couple of changes to get players better prepared for the endeavour. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARCRaiders_Expeditions-Infographic.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first major change comes directly from player feedback. After hearing from players that the required Stash value for the maximum amount of rewards was too high, Embark has decided to lower it. The required value for maximum rewards is now <strong>3 million coins</strong> <strong>(600K per skill point)</strong>. Players will still get five skill points for reaching the 3 million Stash value mark.</p>



<p>The second major change is the introduction of a new <strong>catch-up mechanic</strong> meant specifically for Raiders who were not able to obtain enough coins during the first Expedition period. This mechanic lets Raiders reclaim the skill points they missed, with catch-up skill points being heavily discounted. "<em>Amass the entire Stash value and enjoy your skill points before everyone else, fail to do so and the catch-up system will allow you to close the gap over time</em>," <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">a blog post on the game's official website reads</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For this Expedition, you will need to gather 300K Stash value per skill point missing from the first Expedition. When departing, coins will contribute to the skill points of the second Expedition, before contributing to missing skill points from the first one</em>."</p>



<p>If you're participating in the Expedition for the first time with the start of the second Expedition next month, then you'll also be able to get the rewards from the first Expedition. The rewards for the second Expediton are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Evolved Patchwork outfit (permanent)</li>



<li>Scrappy cosmetics (permanent)</li>



<li>Expedition Indicator Icon (permanent)</li>



<li>24 Stash Spaces (permanent) </li>



<li>+0-5 skill points (permanent) </li>



<li>5-10% XP boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>6-12% Scrappy materials boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>60-70% repair value increase (consecutive)</li>
</ul>
