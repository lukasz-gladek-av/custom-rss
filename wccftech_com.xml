			<p>Yesterday, Croatian game developer Croteam announced The Talos Principle: Reawakened, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the first entry in the adventure franchise. A substantial visual upgrade is the first thing you'll notice, but there's a lot more, according to the studio.</p>
<p>Reawakened includes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/talos-principle-dlc-road-gehenna-announcned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Road to Gehenna expansion</a> and adds a brand new chapter called In the Beginning. Croteam says the new content explores the Simulation's origins and the challenges of its first test, adding new layers to the game's philosophical and narrative depth. Moreover, the developer will release a puzzle editor with The Talos Principle: Reawakened to empower&nbsp;modders to build unique worlds and challenges for the whole community.</p>

			<p>Rocksteady has <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will end in January 2025 with the release of Season 4's Episode 8. That's not surprising in the least, since the game was a massive flop in terms of sales (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost</a> publisher Warner Bros. Games a 41% decrease in Q2 2024 revenue) and critical reception. Here on Wccftech, reviewer Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 5 out of 10 at launch:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful. Perhaps most damning, not even the thing promised in the game’s title – fighting and dispatching the Justice League – ends up being particularly fun or memorable. Those who really want to see what becomes of the Arkhamverse may not be able to resist picking this up, but I suggest waiting for a steep discount before subjecting yourself to this tedious team-up.</em></p>
<p>Those steep discounts have arrived, though. For the recently ended Steam Autumn sale, the game was 95% off. Now it's back at full price, but there will likely be another large discount with the Holiday sale that starts in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Rocksteady also improved Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League in various ways throughout the past year, keeping the full announced plan of four post-launch seasons, which introduced new maps and playable characters: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gets-season-1-roadmap-joker-coming-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-2-is-out-next-week-will-add-mrs-freeze-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mrs. Freeze</a>, Lawless, and now Deathstroke, who was added with today's update. Deathstroke features a close-range, melee combat playstyle powered by his sword. This is complemented by the following firearms: Assault Rifles, Shotguns, and Sniper Rifles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/M04_Mayhem_10-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The new seasonal episode also introduces a new medieval-like Elseworld inspired by DC's Dark Knights of Steel comic book series. Last but certainly not least, the new update adds the long-awaited Offline Mode, allowing players to experience all content released for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League without an Internet connection. However, all online features will also remain available for the time being, so co-op play is still going to be an option.</p>
<p>As for what's next for Rocksteady, it's worth reminding that the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit</a> by layoffs a few months ago. The rumor is that they've been working <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a Director's Cut for Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Then, perhaps, they'll return to the Batman: Arkham franchise, though it will inevitably take a few years.</p>

			<p>October saw a lot of huge releases this month, including the highly-anticipated release of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, as well as games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Overall, the month saw a lot of huge releases, with a lot of them performing incredibly well and hitting major milestones for the franchise or developer.</p>
<p>When it comes to retail and digital games, it's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was on the top of the charts. Even though the exact number has not been confirmed by Activision or Treyarch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/">they have announced that this game</a> was the best-selling in the franchise thus far and crushed major milestones for the game. In addition, Circana has <a href="https://www.circana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had the most promotional volume, capturing 70 promotions for this game. It was promoted in stores like GameStop, with front-page coverage on websites like GameStop, Target, Walmart, and Amazon.</p>
<p>In terms of Twitch content, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a> remained on top for the month of October, as the semifinals of Worlds took place on October 27, which was the most-watched event. Peak concurrent viewership reached 1.64&nbsp; million viewers. While they didn't make the top five, both Silent Hill 2 and Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero debuted in the top 10 games, with Silent Hill 2 taking seventh place and Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero! Just about making it at number nine.</p>
<p>Another surprise was <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/">the massive success of Silent Hill 2</a>. While there were a lot of people who had faith that the game would be done well, Bloober Team has not had a stellar reputation in the past, leading a lot of hardcore Silent Hill fans to feel uncertain about the game. However, it did incredibly well, sold well, and has been nominated for multiple awards in different ceremonies. Additionally, Silent Hill 2 had 37 unique promotions, as captured by Circana. This comes as a surprise, considering the game has no Xbox Release. However, it's been confirmed by PlayStation that Silent Hill 2 was at the top of reorders, among the top games in the country, and among the top new games, with Steam promoting the game on its front page banner.</p>
<p>When it comes to retail, Sonic x Shadow Generations took the seventh place for unique promotions, and was one of two Sega titles in the top 10, with the other game being Metaphor: ReFantazio, another title that did incredibly well in sales and has been nominated for multiple awards.</p>
<p>October was a very stacked month, whereas November was relatively quiet and didn't have as many big titles. It's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was a major performer across a lot of categories in the Circana report.</p>
