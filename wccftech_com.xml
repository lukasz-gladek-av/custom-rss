<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon launched in late May after a sizable early access period. The game earned itself a decent fanbase on Steam, where it is estimated to have sold between 520K and 645K units. Steam user reviews are also very positive, with an 88% rating. However, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tainted-grail-something-wyrd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 6.5 out of 10</a> due to some severe bugs:</p>



<p><em>Alas, my fifty-hour playthrough of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon ended with a whimper as I could do little more than roam around the two maps I had fully cleared, a world thatâ€™s beautiful when you stop to examine the splendor but is interrupted by hitches and slowdown the moment you start walking forward. Perhaps in another few months time, once Questline has had the time to patch out the game-crushing bugs, this is one trip to Avalon worth checking out.</em></p>



<p>Hopefully, this patch has solved them.</p>
