			<p>Hades 2 v1.0 is here, and even though it's been in early access for over a year, there are plenty who waited for its full launch before jumping into Supergiant's latest.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Myself included, as I said in my review</a> of Hades 2, I avoided the sequel so I could have the same experience I had with the first game. Now that I've spent a good deal of time with the game and have felled Chronos and reached Olympus' peak, there are a few nuggets of wisdom I feel ready to share.</p>



<p>Starting with what is undoubtedly the only thing that the action fans of the first Hades game are curious about when it comes to jumping into Hades 2. How good are the weapons and which one is the best?</p>



<p>This tier guide will go through which are the best weapons in Hades 2, and where their pros and cons lie, even if they're not always what you want to grab on your way down into the Underworld, or up towards Mount Olympus.</p>



<h2 id="h-hades-2-weapons-tier-guide">Hades 2 Weapons Tier Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-the-sister-blades-lim-and-oros">S-Tier: The Sister Blades, Lim and Oros</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Sister Blades, Lim and Oros, in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting with the best of the best, there is really only one weapon sitting at the top of Mount Olympus compared to the other five Nocturnal arms available to Melinoë, and it's the Sister Blades, Lim and Oros.</p>



<p>They're the fastest weapons in Hades 2, with each of their starting aspects all extremely viable for wherever you are in the game. They don't need certain boons to be powerful; you can build around them easily, no matter what you're trying to lean into.</p>



<p>The Special lets you hit multiple enemies with different curses quickly, and while the two aspects you can unlock are more than viable, Melinoë's own aspect is already so powerful that you don't need to focus your resources and efforts on upgrading anything else.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-the-witch-s-staff-the-black-coat-and-the-moonstone-axe">A-Tier: The Witch's Staff, The Black Coat, and The Moonstone Axe</h3>



<p>Half of all the Nocturnal Arms sit in the A-tier, because they're all better than the rest but none are as good as the Sister Blades. </p>



<p><strong>The Witch's Staff, Descura</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Witch's Staff in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting off with The Witch's Staff, Descura, which is also the first weapon you'll have available to you right at the beginning of Hades 2. The Staff is similar to your starting sword in the first Hades. It's an all-around solid choice, even with a reliance on its charged attacks that really make the Staff shine. You'll definitely want to be levelling up your mana bar throughout your run with this weapon equipped, or have Arcana cards like The Unseen equipped, but that doesn't hold the staff back from being a strong choice.</p>



<p><strong>Moonstone Axe, Zorephet</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Moonstone Axe in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Zorephet, the Moonstone Axe's major drawback is that it's unfortunately slower than you might like for a typical run in Hades 2. That said, the aspect of Thanatos changes that, bringing it up to speed so you'll be able to do the immense amount of damage the axe already does even faster.</p>



<p>Even without the aspect of Thanatos, the Moonstone Axe more than makes up for its slow attack speed with the massive amounts of damage a single hit can deal. It's Special attack is also great at taking out multiple enemies and dealing Curse damage to every enemy in any given encounter since it easily reaches across most of the tighter spaces in Hades 2. </p>



<p>Yes, you might need to get used to how slow it can be, and you might not find your groove with it until you've unlocked the aspect of Thanatos, but even before that, it is a solid choice to build around and one of the better weapons to use in the game overall.</p>



<p><strong>The Black Coat, Xinth</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Black Coat in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the biggest drawback to The Black Coat, Xinth, is that it's the last weapon you'll unlock out of the six. That doesn't stop it from reaching above the other weapons you'll have had more time with by the time you get to it.</p>



<p>It's a jet pack that launches missiles and punches through enemies like nothing else. What more could you ask for, really? How it changes your sprint might take a bit to get used to, but it's Special attack lets you hit multiple enemies at once, its main attack is quick and akin to the speed of the Sister Blades, and one of its aspects even unlocks a powerful hidden Hex that is otherwise unavailable to you.</p>



<p>Like every other weapon mentioned so far, it's fairly easy to build around and doesn't require any particular boons or upgrades to be effective.</p>



<h3 id="h-b-tier-umbral-flames-ygnium">B-Tier: Umbral Flames, Ygnium</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Umbral Flames in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Umbral Flames can take some getting used to, and like the Witch's Staff, it's reliant on you having a large mana bar or Arcana cards like The Unseen equipped, so you're not running around without the use of your charged attacks. That said, there's more to these flames than meets the eye when you first grab them in hand.</p>



<p>Its range lets you do consistent damage while staying out of the line of fire, and its Special orbiting around you helps keep enemies at bay when you don't have your Cast available to you. It's Eos aspect also adds a slow-moving grenade ready to do massive damage on top of the damage you're already dolling out with its base attack. </p>



<h3 id="h-c-tier-argent-skull">C-Tier: Argent Skull</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Argent Skull in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This will probably be the most controversial placement for this whole list, because yes, the Argent Skull, Revaal, can be massively powerful - if you have the right upgrades. That's why I have it all the way down in C-tier.</p>



<p>Out of all six weapons, the Argent Skull is the most 'great with the right upgrades' weapon in the game. At least for me, in a roguelike, that's not the marker of a good weapon choice. Without those upgrades, it packs a strong punch but makes you grab your ammo after firing.</p>



<p>I'm not saying this weapon isn't viable - all six can lead you to a win at the peak of Mount Olympus or in the depths of the Underworld, including the Argent Skull. But out of all of them, it's the one that comes with the biggest asterisk, because not only does it only get more useful with the right upgrades, it actively puts you in harm's way with how you'll need to move across each encounter to keep the skull loaded and ready to fire.</p>



<hr>



<p>Ultimately, these rankings are based on my own experiences with each weapon, and what you prefer might be different. Just make sure to give each a try to find what you like and what fits your playstyle.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Today Is The Last Day To Redeem Microsoft Rewards Points For Xbox Game Pass Subscriptions]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/today-is-the-last-day-to-redeem-microsoft-rewards-points-for-xbox-game-pass-subscriptions.1312942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starting tomorrow, October 1, 2025, you'll no longer be able to redeem Microsoft Rewards points towards Xbox Game Pass subscriptions, which means today, September 30, 2025, is the last day you'll be able to redeem any Microsoft Rewards points you may have towards Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m22wu2q4st2f">first spotted by Wario64</a>, who shared the statement from Microsoft announcing that you'll no longer be able to redeem Microsoft Rewards points for Xbox Game Pass. That said, there is still a way to get Xbox Game Pass through redeeming Microsoft Rewards points; you'll have to use your Rewards points towards redeeming an Xbox gift card.</p>



<p>As Wario64 points out, that means if you want to use your points to get even just one month of Game Pass, you'll need 6,000 more points than you would have if you could still redeem them directly for a Game Pass subscription.</p>







<p>It's the latest change to the Rewards Points system, and one that hasn't been met with favour from those who actively use the system. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1nuhtri/microsoft_rewards_starting_october_1st_users_will/">quick scroll through the Xbox Reddit page regarding the news</a> shows users are not happy that they'll need to spend thousands more points than before. </p>



<p>In other Game Pass news, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">Microsoft and Xbox are reportedly putting more behind the subscription service than ever before in 2025</a>, while former Microsoft and Bethesda executive Pete Hines says that <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">subscription services like Game Pass don't properly reward the developers and studios making the content that fills the services</a>. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my article about the $55 billion EA buyout deal</a>, I singled out BioWare as the likely target of potential layoffs following the closure. Indeed, later today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming posted an article</a> citing inside sources from the Canadian studio, revealing that the employees are already worried about this sudden transition.</p>



<p>Two of the anonymous sources allegedly said:</p>



<p><em>Look at the negativity that came after Dragon Age. If we felt it was only going to get worse then, you can imagine what some of us think now.</em></p>



<p><em>I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs. Kind of feels like a matter of time.</em></p>



<p>The reference is to last year's launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the studio's first new game since the massive failure of Anthem. Unfortunately, despite a fairly positive critical reception, the game did not sell nearly as well as publisher Electronic Arts had hoped (the goal was to hit 3 million players, but in January 2025, EA said Veilguard had only 'engaged' 1.5 million players), <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to layoffs that brought the studio headcount to less than a hundred</a>. </p>



<p>BioWare is now focused on making the next Mass Effect game, but will they even get the chance? For now, the sentiment inside the studio is simply to go ahead until they are told otherwise:</p>



<p><em>We're going to keep working until they tell us we are done. It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.</em></p>



<p>Insider Gaming even reports having heard that there were attempts to sell off BioWare at some point, though they must have gone nowhere for the time being, as there was no such official news alongside the buyout deal.</p>



<p>Perhaps that would be the best chance for the studio that made some of the greatest Western roleplaying games of all time, such as Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age. As things stand, on one hand, Electronic Arts going private could mean slightly less pressure to deliver right away; on the other, the publisher has a lot of debt and its new owners (PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners) may want immediate cost-cutting measures to deal with it. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/suda-51-would-like-to-make-peacemaker-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suda51-would-like-to-make-a-peacemaker-game.1312870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Goichi Suda (also known as Suda51) is undoubtedly one of the most eclectic Japanese game designers, not to mention one of those whose opinions are always interesting to read. Recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRxQxndH7QM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he made a statement to the Future Game Show channel</a> about wanting to make a game based on the character Peacemaker. When asked which DC Comics character he'd choose if given the chance, he replied (via a translator):</p>



<p><em>Peacemaker. I'd like to see some new ways of murdering people that aren't in the show and in the comics. That's one of the things we're good at Grasshopper Manufacture: finding ways to kill s*it and making it grotty and bloody and stuff. So, yeah, I'd like to see Peacemaker find some new, interesting ways of murdering people.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Suda51 already collaborated with James Gunn, the current co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, on the 2012 action/adventure game Lollipop Chainsaw. Gunn specifically aided with designing that game's story and characters.</p>



<p>Nowadays, James Gunn is the grand architect (alongside Peter Safran) of the new DC Universe, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which includes games, movies, and TV</a>. Truth be told, there hasn't been anything in the gaming space related to the new DCU, but Gunn <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-gunn-excited-about-one-dc-games-in-particular-still-early-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided an update last month</a> when he said that he was excited about 'one specific thing' when it comes to DC games. He also clarified that it's still in the early stages, however.</p>



<p>Incidentally, we just published an exclusive interview with Suda51 about Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action/adventure game ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN. <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read it here in its entirety</a>.</p>



<p>As for Peacemaker, the character also made our headlines because Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the character-specific dance emote from their popular game Fortnite</a> after the latest plot twist seen in Episode 6 of the show's second season, currently airing on HBO Max.</p>
