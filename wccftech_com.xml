			<p>Hideo Kojima has delivered his Happy New Year message to the world, as it's already 2026 in his home of Japan. Along with well-wishes for the new year, he's provided an update on what 2026 will mean for Kojima Productions, and according to Kojima, it means he's getting his head down and rooting himself in his home and his work.</p>



<p>Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has been out the door for months, the studio can look ahead at its next major projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">OD and Physint</a>. According to Kojima, this is part of Kojima Productions moving forward with the "<em>Second Phase that leads into Kojima Productions 'Third Phase.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Happy New Year,</em>" Kojima began in his post on his <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2006387335114670562?s=20">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>In 2026, we will move forward with the 'Second Phase' that leads into KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS’ 'Third Phase'.”</em></p>



<p>"<em>Unlike last year, I was traveling all over the world, this year will be about staying grounded and laying solid foundations. We will continue development on the horror game 'OD' and move forward with preparations for the espionage action title 'PHYSINT.' This includes casting actors, scanning, and performance capture shoots.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy New Year.<br>In 2026, we will move forward with the “Second Phase” that leads into KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS’ “Third Phase.”<br>Unlike last year, like I was traveling all over the world, this year will be about staying grounded and laying solid foundations. We will continue development… <a href="https://t.co/yje0zAY1md">pic.twitter.com/yje0zAY1md</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2006387335114670562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It sounds like Kojima sees the year ahead as a time to really dig into Physint and OD, and while Death Stranding 2 being out of the way means he and the rest of the studio can focus on both games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-10th-anniversary-future-projects/">both titles are seemingly still early in development.</a> In other words, barring some incredible surprise, we won't be seeing a new game from Kojima Productions in 2026.</p>



<p>Beyond the studio's upcoming game projects, Hideo Kojima also <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-death-stranding-animated-movie-is-in-the-works-with-raised-by-wolves-creator-aaron-guzikowski-writing-the-script/">shared an update on the multiple adaptations in the works based on Death Stranding</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Also, be pushing forward with the live-action film of DEATH STRANDING, as well as its animation projects, both the movie and series. In addition, we’re preparing several 'events' this year. Once things are finalized, I’ll be able to share more.</em>"</p>



<p>So while 2026 likely won't be marked by a new game under Kojima's and the studios' belt, it will still be a significant one for Hideo Kojima as he enters the year of his 40th anniversary in game development. "This year also marks my 40th anniversary in the game industry, from 1986, and began my journey in game creation.<em> Thank you, as always, for your continued support and supporting Kojima Productions. I look forward to another great year</em>."</p>

            <guid>1394911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the latest edition of the so-called '<strong><a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of the Sanderson</a></strong>', the yearly recap that the popular fantasy author writes to let his fans know what he's worked on and what's next, <strong>Brandon Sanderson</strong> revealed that he's been talking to triple-A game companies to make a <strong>Mistborn game</strong> happen. Here's the relevant quote from the blog post:</p>



<p><em>I’ve started to get some real interest on the video game front, and I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. To that end, I’ve started talking to some AAA developers. This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging one. These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last… oh, six~seven years, so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently.</em></p>



<p><em>I’m trying to do things differently this time in an effort to retain control of my video game rights. I already have interest from some major players in the Video Game industry (who I like a lot). So if you are a decision maker at a AAA studio, or a major independent, and you’ve always wanted to make a Mistborn or Stormlight game… well, you would want to contact my reps now.</em></p>



<p>The key change is that Sanderson had unwisely decided to license the film and game rights together, and ultimately, neither thing happened. In October 2016, the author selected DMG Entertainment as the licensee of not just Mistborn but the entire <strong>Cosmere</strong> (Sanderson's fantasy universe, where most of his books are set), and an adaptation of Mistborn: The Final Empire was planned, but the project stalled.</p>



<p>Presumably, the gaming rights have now reverted to the author, who is now free to seek a new partner for the game adaptation. There once was a project called Mistborn: Birthright, announced in 2012 and developed by Little Orbit (which would later be infamously known for the failure of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029260/Unsung_Story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsung Story</a>), but it was canceled.</p>



<p>Sanderson himself is a massive gamer. In early 2022, he made headlines when he jokingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/brandon-sanderson-complains-about-fromsoftwares-choice-of-george-r-r-martin-for-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complained</a> that<strong> FromSoftware</strong> had picked <strong>A Song of Ice and Fire</strong> author <strong>G.R.R. Martin</strong> to help them create the mythos of <strong>Elden Ring</strong>. He did contribute to a game shortly afterward, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-series-developer-announces-turn-based-tactical-game-moonbreaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working with <strong>Unknown Worlds</strong> on the turn-based strategy game <strong>Moonbreaker</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Still, there's no question that he's very excited about the prospect of a triple-A game set on <strong>Scadrial</strong> (the world where Mistborn takes place). As a massive fan of all things Sanderson, Mistborn very much included, I am equally intrigued. There's a lot of potential for an action RPG here, especially with the incredibly deep mythology already established by Sanderson and the cool allomancy and feruchemy magic systems.</p>



<p>Who would you pick as the ideal developer of a Mistborn game? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			<p>It's almost 2026, and while a new year is always exciting, a new month means another batch of PS Plus games is headed towards PS Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium tier subscribers. In what has practically become a monthly tradition, a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-vous-revele-le-premier-jeu-du-mois-de-lannee-2026-60812">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has revealed one of the games that kicks off the year for PS Plus Essential subscribers: Need for Speed Unbound.</p>



<p>The latest Need for Speed game in the franchise, Unbound arrived on current-gen consoles on December 2, 2022. It was a more-than-solid racer at the time of its launch, though it wasn't able to reach the highs that made the series so iconic. Though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-charging-5-dollars-to-unlock-map-markers-new-races-challenges/">decidedly fell off the radar of players not too long after its debut,</a> developer Criterion Games and Codemasters have done a good job of updating it with multiple drops of new cars, tracks, challenge modes, etc. </p>



<p>As Wccftech's Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/need-for-speed-unbound/">put it in his review of the game at launch</a>, "<em>Need for Speed Unbound is the franchise’s best entry in a decade, although the competition for that title wasn't particularly stiff. The game offers polished tech, good (if slightly dated) open-world design, and a varied array of events and challenges, but still lags behind the current open-world racer pack leaders. The fantasy of becoming an underground racing champ is also hampered by a restrictive, ill-considered progression system. Nostalgic fans will find plenty to like here, and more general players might want to consider a test drive once the game is marked down, but “need” may be a strong word to attach to Criterion’s latest.</em>"</p>



<p>The game's last major update, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-unbound/news/end-of-kaizen-review">Volume 9, arrived earlier in 2025,</a> though Criterion has had its focus shift away from Need for Speed while it worked on delivering Battlefield 6 this past October. Its arrival as a PS Plus Essential game will technically be the second time it has been added to PlayStation's subscription service, as it was made a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-february-2024-assassins-creed-valhalla-nfs-unbound-tales/">PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalog title back in February 2024</a>.</p>



<p>So, unfortunately for those subscribers, you're technically getting one game less than you otherwise would if Unbound weren't already available to subscribers on the Extra or above tiers. Though there's always the chance that an added game coming to Extra and Premium subscribers only will make up for it.</p>



<p>It should also be mentioned that, while Billbil-kun has an immaculate record at this point when it comes to announcing PS Plus titles early (they've almost never been wrong), it is still an unofficial report at the time of this writing. So take it for what it's worth. </p>



<p>If you don't believe it'll be one of the three free games for Essential subscribers, and you wouldn't mind starting your 2026 by checking it out, then you can always grab it on the PS Store with the Ultimate Collection edition, currently at 85% off for PlayStation's Holiday Sale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>2025 was practically defined by Indie Games, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> running away with (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stripped-of-indie-game-awards-goty-win-over-genai-use/">almost</a>) every Game of the Year win, Hollow Knight Silksong and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Hades 2</a> finally landing and consuming the entire industry for at least a month. While other titles like Peak, Blue Prince, The Seance of Blake Manor, Dispatch, Ball x Pit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eternal-strands-the-world-is-your-playground/">Eternal Strands</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/routine-review-lunar-software-raw-fury/">Routine</a>, and Megabonk, to name a few, stole attention away from big-name releases across the whole year.</p>



<p>So, will 2026 be any different? We can probably bet on at least one unsuspecting indie game taking the spotlight that no one sees coming, but it's more of a gamble to say 2026 will be as defined by indies as 2025 was.</p>



<p>That said, there are a few indie games that we know are coming up that could absolutely dominate the conversation, even be Game of the Year contenders. These are Wccftech's most anticipated indie games for 2026.</p>



<p><em>Other Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per category:</em> <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-slay-the-spire-ii-march-2026-pc">Slay the Spire II (March 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slay-the-Spire-2-Key-Art-scaled.png"></a><figcaption><em>Slay the Spire 2 key art. Image credit: Mega Crit</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>A game that made our list for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">2025's Most Anticipated Indie Games</a>, Slay the Spire II returns to the 2026 list after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-delayed-march-2026-mega-crit/">was delayed "<em>to a secret Thursday in March 2026</em>" back in September 2025</a>. Mega Crit may not have put a specific release date on it, but specifying that it will arrive on one of four possible Thursdays feels like the studio is confident it won't have to delay the early access release again - at least not so far that it won't arrive in 2026.</p>



<p>Slay the Spire II is the long-awaited sequel to one of the most popular deckbuilding roguelike games of all time, and Mega Crit is one of the biggest success stories to come from the indie world. It's early access arrival will be one of the bigger events of 2026 for indie games, and even in its early access form, it could be a potential contender for Game of the Year 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-mina-the-hollower-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Mina the Hollower (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mina-the-Hollower-Delayed.png"></a><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower. Image credit: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another game that was supposed to arrive in 2025 but got pushed into 2026, Mina the Hollower is the long-awaited return of Yacht Club Games, the studio behind the critically acclaimed platformer Shovel Knight. What <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-delayed-yacht-club-games/">was not intended to be "<em>a major delay</em>"</a> ended up becoming one, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDY4MDU4MywiZXhwIjoxNzY1Mjg1MzgzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNk41RDBLR0NURlkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.tTCDzLvXeRacM9mzJfRv3juJV7WGiMAKvYS8DWRQBFs">a report from Bloomberg</a> revealed deeper issues within the studio as to why the game was taking so long.</p>



<p>That said, Yacht Club is an incredibly talented team, and this old-school Legend of Zelda-style adventure game with an energetic mouse and the same incredible pixel-art the studio is known for behind it all means that you cannot count Mina the Hollower out.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch">The Eternal Life of Goldman (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman_KEYART-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman. Image credit: Weappy Studio</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Weappy Studio's upcoming 2D platformer, The Eternal Life of Goldman, is arguably one of the most visually stunning upcoming games. Its art will remind you of Cuphead almost immediately, and if the platforming gameplay can match how good it looks, then this could be one of the surprising hits of 2026.</p>



<p>If it arrives in 2026, that is. There's currently no release window for it, but it appeared at multiple showcases in 2025. If it wasn't going to be ready to release soon, or at least if Weappy Studios didn't think it would be ready, we probably would have seen less of it. Hopefully, once 2026 begins, we'll start to see more of the game and get a proper release date. For now, we'll wait with baited breath.</p>



<h2 id="h-replaced-march-12-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Replaced (March 12, 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Replaced-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Official key art for Replaced. Image credit: Sad Cat Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Sad Cat Studios has had a long road to the release of Replaced. When it was first showcased in 2021, it was one of the highlights of that year's Xbox show, and it immediately shot up to being one of the most highly anticipated indie games. At least, that was until <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">Russia's invasion of Ukraine interrupted its development</a>, and the game had to be delayed.</p>



<p>Now, it's due out on March 12, 2026, and it hasn't lost any of the lustre it had when it was shown in 2021. It still looks like it will be this incredible, cyberpunk adventure that leans on some gorgeous-looking pixel art and a deep narrative. Who knows if it will live up to those expectations, of course, but it's exciting to know that Sad Cat Studios is getting the chance to try.</p>



<h2 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire-march-19-2026-pc-ps5-ps4-xbox-series-xbox-one-nintendo-switch">MOUSE: P.I. For Hire (March 19, 2026 - PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Mouse-P.I.-For-Hire.png"></a><figcaption><em>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire. Image credit: Fumi Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once the original likeness of Mickey Mouse was old enough to be in the public domain, everyone knew that we had an onslaught of Mouse-adjacent projects coming our way. One of them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3094480/Bad_Cheese/">Bad Cheese</a>, was a first-person horror game that arrived in September 2025. Another, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, is a first-person shooter where you play as private investigator Jack Pepper in what looks like an eccentric and bombastic adventure.</p>



<p>It's another game on this list that has been a long time coming, since it was first revealed back in 2023. It even stars Troy Baker as the lead character. All together with its art, animation, gameplay, and narrative, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire could be one of 2026's top indie games when it arrives on March 19, 2026. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"><strong>2025 has been a great year for role-playing games</strong></a>, and 2026 is setting out to be another incredible year for one of the most popular gaming genres around. While next year won't see the release of many new properties, 2026 will see the <strong>return of some beloved series</strong>, with new entries in their respective franchises as well as <strong>remakes that breathe new life</strong> in all time classics.</p>



<p>Here are the <strong>five RPGs</strong> officially confirmed for a 2026 launch that we feel deserve your attention the most at this point in time.</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-3-february-6-2026-pc-playstation-5">Nioh 3 (February 6, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nioh-3.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>With its open-field mechanics and tight combat, Nioh 3 is one of the most anticipated RPGs launching in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Following games like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,</strong></em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Rise of the Ronin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Team NINJA</strong>&nbsp;is finally returning to the series that has defined the studio's course since 2017: the&nbsp;<strong>Nioh series</strong>.</span></p>



<p>Unlike <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh 2</a></strong></em>, which refined the formula of its predecessor, bringing it to heights that made it rival FromSoftware games in terms of mechanical complexity, <strong>Nioh 3</strong> is set to provide a brand new experience with the introduction of <strong>open-fields</strong> that will provide a more involving way of engaging with the game's world inspired by different time periods in Japan, including the <strong>Sengoku and Bakumatsu eras</strong>.</p>



<p>This open-field approach, however, won't water down the mechanics that define the Nioh series. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">With the introduction of&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">two fighting styles - Samurai and Ninja - </strong>new mechanics inspired by other games developed by the studio, and a challenging, uncompromising experience,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;is set to become one of the&nbsp;best games by Team NINJA, if not the very best.</a></strong></span></p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-february-5-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined (February 5, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will bring the seventh entry in the series to a whole new audience in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-new-information/"><strong><em>Dragon Quest XII</em> is nowhere to be seen</strong></a>, the popular JRPG franchise hasn't been dormant. Over the past couple of years, the first three entries in the series received excellent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">HD-2D makeovers</a></strong>, which will be followed this year by a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/">full-on remake of Dragon Quest VII</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Although the seventh entry in the series was already remade on Nintendo 3DS, <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> is set to become the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"><strong>overhauling everything from visuals to gameplay.</strong></a> With its <strong>beautiful handcrafted artstyle and diorama environments</strong>, a streamlined story experience which aims at <strong>trimming the original's very long story</strong>, new scenarios focused on the Hero, Maribel and Keifer, an <strong>improved Vocations system</strong> with the ability to equip two Vocations per character, new spells and skills for an enhanced battle experience, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> promises to deliver the <strong>prime turn-based JRPG experience in 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Will this be enough to make the long wait for <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> more bearable? We will find out this February.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">The Blood of Dawnwalker (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Blood-of-Dawnwalker-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In early 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that former <strong>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</strong> director <strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong> had founded a new studio called <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong>. Later that year, the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>NetEase</strong> had provided an investment to create a new <strong>triple-A RPG</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> to be titled <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong>. Their game is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being published</a> by <strong>Bandai Namco</strong>, though, which is why NetEase's move to pull back from many Western studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-isnt-in-any-danger-despite-netease-involvement-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did not affect Rebel Wolves</a>.</p>



<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker clearly borrows a lot from the framework of The Witcher III (which is only a great thing, as that is one of the finest open world RPGs ever made), but it also adds a few key innovations, such as the fact that there is essentially no difference between main and side quests. The protagonist, Coen, <strong>has 30 days to save his family</strong>; how to reach that goal is entirely up to the player. Tackling specific objectives is radically different during the day, when Coen is human, and at nighttime, when his vampiric abilities manifest. Because of these elements, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-freedom-closer-to-fallout-1-2-pen-paper-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> its role-playing freedom was <strong>inspired by pen-and-paper games</strong>.</p>



<p>Its setting and peculiar twist on vampire lore, with them actually coming out in the open and ruling the Carpathians-inspired Vale Sangora, is also intriguing.

<h2 id="h-control-resonant-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">CONTROL Resonant (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Control-Resonant.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>CONTROL Resonant is a major shake-up of its predecessor's formula that will deliver Remedy Entertainment's most ambitious experience to date</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the first game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/"><strong>a brilliant action-adventure title</strong></a>, <strong>Remedy</strong> is taking a <strong>"not-so-safe" approach</strong> for the sequel. <strong>CONTROL Resonant</strong> officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/"><strong>shifts the series into full-fledged action RPG territory</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Seven years after the original, the lockdown on the Oldest House has collapsed, and the <strong>paranatural chaos</strong> has spilled out into a <strong>quarantined, "open-ended" Manhattan</strong>. Stepping into the shoes of Jesse’s brother, <strong>Dylan Faden</strong>, players will have to fight this new reality-warping threat with the help of the <strong>Aberrant</strong>, a brutal, shapeshifting melee weapon that pairs with expanded psychic abilities.</p>



<p>With a heavy focus on <strong>build-crafting</strong>, varied enemy types that can match your mobility, and a <strong>meticulously authored version of New York City</strong>, <em>CONTROL Resonant</em> looks to be <strong>Remedy's most ambitious project to date</strong>, and one of the most interesting action RPGs to launch in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fable-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Fable (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fable-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>It was early 2018 when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-game-confirmed-playground/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard the first rumors</a> that <strong>Playground Games</strong> had decided to accept the arduous task of rebooting the long-dormant <strong>Fable</strong> series. The game itself was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, but it quickly became clear that it still had a long road ahead of its release. In 2022, a former Playground developer who worked on the project's early stages <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-progress-slow-playground-lack-of-rpg-experience-frugal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the studio's lack of experience with role-playing games and their frugal approach to development were slowing down progress.</p>



<p>Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-first-gameplay-xbox-games-showcase-richard-ayoade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2023</a> with an in-game trailer that featured actor <strong>Richard Ayoade</strong>, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2024</a> with a trailer that featured actor <strong>Matt King</strong> as well as some gameplay. More importantly, that trailer came with a promise of a <strong>2025 launch</strong>, which of course did not happen. In February 2025, Xbox Studios head <strong>Craig Duncan</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the game required additional development time and was thus <strong>delayed until 2026</strong>, accompanied by some promising new gameplay footage.</p>



<p>There has been no further news from the studio. A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Fable might not even make it next year, although for now, there's no solid evidence to confirm that. As such, we remain hopeful in a 2026 release. </p>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></h2>



<p>As mentioned above, 2026 is poised to be a fantastic year for role-playing games, and selecting only five titles proved to be a daunting task. Below are several more notable titles that are expected to make waves in the next 12 months.</p>
