			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/">Overwatch 2</a> team at Blizzard has just unionized, making it the second wall-to-wall union under Blizzard after the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">World of Warcraft team unionized in July 2024</a>.</p>
<p>It's the latest major step forward for unionization in the video game industry, as almost 200 developers at Activision Blizzard are members of the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA. They now join the ranks of <a href="https://code-cwa.org/news/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">One BGS USA</a>, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">One BGS Montreal</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers">ZeniMax Workers United</a>, <a href="https://x.com/WeAreGWA">Game Workers Alliance at Raven Software</a>, and the aforementioned WoWGG-CWA.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Nearly 200 game developers behind Activision Blizzard’s hit franchise Overwatch have joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA), becoming the latest group of video game workers at Microsoft-owned studios to form a wall-to-wall</span></em> <em>union</em>," a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">press release</a> from the CWA reads.</p>
<p>"<em>A neutral arbitrator confirmed today that an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal. The workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, Calif., and Microsoft has recognized the union.</em>"</p>
<p>While some of the above unions are department-specific, the WoWGG-CWA and the newly formed Overwatch 2 union spread across all departments, from artists to QA to game designers, level designers, etc. The OWGG-CWA will now join its fellow unions in negotiating their first contract, a process that the CWA previously accused <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/microsofts-bargaining-delays-leave-video-game-workers-without-union-contracts-two">Microsoft of dragging its feet on</a>.</p>
<p>Bargaining delays were one of the reasons the ZeniMax Workers United union members cited for overwhelmingly voting in favor of giving strike powers to their bargaining representatives. At the beginning of last month, the vote was announced, with 94% of members voting 'yes' to strike authorization. They have yet to announce if a strike will be called as negotiations continue.</p>
<p>In a report from <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">Kotaku</a>, Blizzard test analyst Simon Hedrick cited the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">mass layoffs</a> that started 2024 as to what drove him to seriously consider unionizing, and that "<em>u</em><em>p to that moment I’d been really happy in what I was doing.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>People were gone out of nowhere and there was nothing we could do about it</em>," Hendrick said. "<em>What I want to protect most here is the people</em>."</p>
<p>Unions can't prevent layoffs, but they can give those affected by them the best-case version of a worst-case scenario, and they can also improve the lives of workers in a number of other ways. Hopefully, the new Overwatch union and the other groups under Microsoft will be able to reach a deal sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>"<em>I'm organizing because I believe in this company, our teams, and the work we do together. Unionizing is about having a seat at the table so that we can work with leadership to build better, more sustainable working conditions,</em>" said senior test analyst and organizing committee member Jess Castillo in the previously mentioned press release. "<em>Ultimately, when we're supported and thriving, we can deliver the best possible experiences to our players, which is what brought all of us here in the first place.</em>"</p>

			<p>DOOM, a series likely thought dead during its twelve-year hiatus (not including re-releases) between DOOM 3 and 2016's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM reboot</a>, is on a high. The success of DOOM, followed by the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM Eternal</a>, means it was inevitable that a new release would come. What I didn't expect was the direction of that, which is where DOOM: The Dark Ages comes in.</p>
<p>By abandoning multiplayer and opting for a pure single-player and narrative-focused experience, DOOM: The Dark Ages takes the series somewhere different and a little medieval.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal. It focuses on an earlier incursion of hell and explains why the Doom Slayer is who he is. Long story short, the Makyrs essentially had him tethered as their slave-weapon, keeping him trapped unless they needed him, just pointing him towards the demons they wanted killed. The series has never really been narrative-heavy, and I'm not going to pretend that it somehow is now, but I do like what they've done here.</p>
<p>Despite his general lack of depth, the Doom Slayer is a surprisingly good character. In the previous games, you could understand perfectly what he was thinking in every circumstance, and that thought is essentially "Kill demons, F- everything else". While he's already in this frame of mind, you will get to see more of his time while under the control of the Makyr, during the invasion of Argent D'nur. You will also meet far more characters than in any other title in the series (that I remember). Where the lore in previous games was relegated to reading the codex entries, here you get it through cutscenes and other monologues. The Doom Slayer is still as vocal as always.</p>
<p>I won't cover more of the story to avoid spoilers, but I've enjoyed the change in direction. This is despite my saying in my DOOM Eternal review that I don't care about the story in a DOOM game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Let's be brutally honest: most people don't come into a DOOM game because of its narrative, including DOOM: The Dark Ages. Having it, and a good one, is just the icing on the extremely bloody and demonic cake. No, people come for the gameplay, the gory fun stuff, and I would argue that it's fun. Clearing what may be a sticking point for some people, I don't care about the lack of a multiplayer mode. Most people know me enough that a multiplayer mode is usually a negative, not a positive.</p>
<p>Rather than including multiplayer, DOOM: The Dark Ages includes the longest campaign in the series. Across 22 different stages, each offering a good level of variety, you will be doing everything from the regular run-and-gun DOOM action, to hopping in an Atlan - a giant humanoid war machine - or even riding a dragon into battle. Add a host of weapons, some returning, others new (including a flail, to stick to the medieval-style theme), and you have exciting demon-murdering gameplay, still joined by melee finishing moves to replenish your health and ammo. As a note, the traditional glory kills are gone unless it's a boss, which some may be disappointed with.</p>
<p>The actual run-and-gun gameplay feels more grounded than in DOOM Eternal, closer to that of DOOM (2016). This isn't to say there isn't any verticality, there is, but it no longer feels like it has delusions of being a secret-platformer. There likely isn't anything here that you won't find familiar if you've played the first game. Every weapon and ability has its use; each can be upgraded with the various currencies and items found throughout the game.</p>
<p>Much like the previous titles, the weapons are well placed within the game, meaning when you need one, it'll be introduced, with a quick tutorial. I recommend reading these because you may miss some of the bonuses weapons can bring. For example, one of the earliest ones can overcharge the energy shields of enemies, causing them to explode. Knowing the additional effects and upgrading the weapons to give them new abilities can be extremely useful in your quest to kill everything that breathes, has ever breathed, and will ever breathe.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Despite my praise of returning to a more horizontal gameplay, I have a few criticisms. Okay, one. I don't like the dragon and anything to do with it. It's cool, but when I'm flying a dragon, it should not be locked into a near horizontal plane once I'm locked onto an enemy. I'm flying a dragon with guns. I want to be able to swoop in and shoot, and I want to do strafing runs. It looks and comes across like it should be aerial combat, but the actual combat feels nothing like that.</p>
<p>This isn't to say it doesn't fit in with the world or narrative, but there is a disconnect between what it is and how it feels like it should be. Particularly when flying outside of combat, which is free-flowing. My thoughts on this don't extend to other things, such as the Atlan, which does fit in well with the rest of the game. It feels slower paced, as expected from a giant mech, but it doesn't feel like it should be something else. Granted, I can imagine some people being frustrated by the slower pace compared to the core gameplay.</p>
<p>Still, these are minor issues in the grand scheme. It's a long campaign packed with DOOM goodness, including finding secrets, codex entries, and more. Exploration is, as always, rewarded. It also does exceptionally well opening up the game on some levels, giving you a vast map to play in and tackle objectives in the way you want. Eschewing the linearity gives it a fresher feel at times, and it's also handy to turn back around and replenish some stocks if you've found that you're struggling in a fight.</p>
<p>It's all tied together with excellent visuals and audio. Now, this being a DOOM game, and it being 2025, that's like saying "the sun will rise in the morning". I still can't emphasise enough that the aesthetics and design of DOOM: The Dark Age are excellent, particularly when you start venturing away from Argent. Add the usual metal riff to this, and you've got a successful, pulse-pounding action and blood-filled game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>So, to put it all quite simply, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a good game—no, it's a very good game. I would recommend it to fans of the genre and people who want to have fun without the risk of anything transmissible via bodily fluids. Unless we're talking about demon blood and guts, there's lots of that. DOOM: The Dark Ages is yet another success from Id Software, and long may they continue.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Nintendo</a> doesn't respond to every rumor and bit of speculation on the internet, but it has stepped up to push back against speculation that AI-generated images were used in <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-shows-new-courses-characters-tricks-and-more/">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Some viewers of Nintendo's last Treehouse presentation for the kart racer suspected that AI-generated images were used in Mario Kart World on the billboards that fill part of the background on the tracks. Specifically, they thought artwork of a bridge and one immediately next to it of a skyscraper being built were AI-generated. A third billboard featuring a car with exaggerated windows was also thought to be AI-generated.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World – Grand Prix Gameplay – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWjkbAQOGY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-suggestion-that-ai-generated-images-used-in-mario-kart-world">Eurogamer</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson bluntly shut down the suspicions that AI-generated content was used in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"<em>AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World</em>," they said.</p>
<p>The images in question might look wonky to players now, but it's worth noting that Nintendo is likely updating and polishing details like these background billboards as much as possible, leading up to the release of the game and the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p>
<p>These billboards could have even been placeholders at the time of the Treehouse presentation that will be swapped with entirely different images for the game's launch, or simply not final versions of the artwork that will feature in the final release. Ultimately, at this stage in the game, we can't determine if these images were AI-generated. It'll be interesting to see if they make it into the final release, and if they remain the same, are updated and polished up, or are changed entirely.</p>
<p>Of course, the simplest explanation here could also be the truth, that these images simply aren't up to snuff, and that these background billboards perhaps aren't where Nintendo's artists have done their best work. People make mistakes all the time, and this could very well be as simple as that.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-community%E2%80%99s-feedback.1185576/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alkimia Interactive has announced that an updated version of the Gothic Remake demo is now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3448280/Gothic_1_Remake__Demo_Nyras_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The demo wasn't very well-received when it first became available during February's Steam Next Fest, but the developers have improved it based on the community's feedback. For example, Alkimia was originally inspired by the slow movement of a game like Red Dead Redemption 2, but players communicated that they'd prefer something more reactive.</p>
<p><em>We see a lot of things we didn't have so much on the radar, for example, like the movement in the game. Our main reference really was Red Dead Redemption 2, which is a game that has a very slow pacing in terms of movement. The clear feedback, though, was people like it more reactive, and that certain actions that are repeated over and over again should be rather quick, which means not realistic.</em></p>
<p><em>In the Demo specifically, there were certain elements that were not working out. The Demo is just what it is. It's not representative of the full Gothic Remake game. The Demo is locked at a certain time of day, so you obviously have just no visual variety. There’s no weather in there — it’s always sunny, right? You see one specific weather and daylight condition all the time. It's not doing justice to the full game.</em></p>
<p><em>Everybody has to realize also that, of course, the Gothic Remake demo has daily routines, but they are nowhere near as detailed as in the original. And of course it has some monsters, but like, of course you won't see how monsters beyond that react. You only see very few characters, and you don't see them in a camp, where they are actually living, where they have a real daily routine.</em></p>
<p><em>They are kind of like all in an extreme situation because they are trapped. You should get an idea of what can happen with progression, but it was maybe a little too fast. So players might get the wrong idea of like, oh, in the Gothic Remake you will actually progress faster than you will do. But no, the pacing is still very much the same, the power curve.</em></p>
<p><em>And then another big problem of the combat in the demo was the hit sounds. There were just clear bugs in there. Sometimes, you would think you'd land a hit with the sword, because the models touch each other, but it wouldn't recognize the hit, so it gives you this awkward feeling of like, oh, the combat system is bad.</em></p>
<p><em>But it's a glitch, it's a bug. It's something we'll address and fix. We're&nbsp;not saying like, hey, all is good, right? There's a lot of stuff we need to improve, much, much further and continue to work on until the very end.</em></p>

<p>Alkimia Interactive has been working on the Gothic Remake&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for more than five years</a>. At Gamescom, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> with the developers and learned about some of the planned changes and additions (such as around ten hours of new content).</p>
