			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://tgs.cesa.or.jp/en">annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, Square Enix released two new trailers for Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales, providing new looks at the two HD-2D games launching this December and next year, respectively.</p>



<p>The Octopath Traveler 0 trailer, which can be watched below, provides a quick look at the game's story and setting, highlighting how players will return to the continent of Orsterra and witness a tale of beginnings. This tale will be made more engaging to experience with some new gameplay features never seen before in the series, like the ability to customize the main playable character, new town building mechanics, and enhanced turn-based combat where players will be able to bring eight characters at the same time, over the four that could be brought in the first two entries in the series.</p>

<p>While much different from Octopath Traveler 0, The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales will have plenty to offer to fans of classic role-playing games besides the gorgeous HD-2D visuals. The new Tokyo Game Show trailer shared today provides a solid overview of the action-focused experience, which looks like a modern take on the classic top-down ARPG formula seen in older entries in The Legend of Zelda series.</p>

<p>Scheduled for release sometime in 2026, and with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">playable demo publicly available on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, I wasn't surprised that a more recent build of The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales wasn't available during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom 2025</a>. My disappointment, however, was made easier to bear by having the chance of testing out Octopath Traveler 0 before its launch on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch. Although my time with the game was short, preventing me from getting deeper into the town building mechanics, it was more than enough to <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-familiar-experience-enhanced-and-improved/">appreciate some of the enhancements to the series formula</a>, especially the bigger combat party,. which are set to open a lot of interesting gameplay possibilities.</p>

			<p>The recently released Steam Deck native build of Baldur's Gate 3 introduces noticeable performance improvements where they matter most, although it is not possible to currently judge how much performance is improved with actual data due to benchmarking tools not being available with this build, according to a new video shared online.</p>



<p>The new video focused on the new build of the cRPG developed by Larian Studio and shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a> highlights how the new native build of the game feels smoother in Act 3. This area is known to be extremely demanding and struggles to run smoothly on every platform, and the footage shown during the video definitely suggests that performance has indeed been improved in some capacity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to know how much performance is improved in the new build because benchmarking tools are unavailable without the Proton compatibility layer. This also prevents users from <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">enabling AMD FSR 4 for better image quality</a>, although Lossless Scaling appears to work even without the compatibility layer, so an upscaling option is still available those who want to enjoy the game with this build.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though the most significant new addition, the native Steam Deck build is only one of the new features introduced in Baldur's Gate 3 by Hotfix #34. The other improvements and fixes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940?emclan=103582791464711919&amp;emgid=511843343389426278">outlined in the official update notes</a> are stability improvements on Xbox consoles, gameplay and audio fixes, and much more.</p>



<p>Considering how long Baldur's Gate 3 is, improving the Steam Deck handheld experience with a native build is highly welcome, allowing more users to experience one of the best cRPGs released in recent times. No matter the platform on which it is played, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game more than worthy of experiencing, in my opinion, thanks to an engaging story, a charming cast of characters, and deep role-playing game mechanics, which make for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">a great adaptation of the D&amp;D 5e ruleset</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot%E2%80%99s-fighting-game-2xko-to-launch-early-access-on-october-7.1306257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Riot Games has announced the launch date for the early access version of 2XKO, its long-awaited fighting game. 2XKO will open its gates to all PC players on October 7, just as the currently ongoing Closed Beta ends. </p>



<p>The developers said the newest playable characters, Vi and Blitzcrank, have been quickly adopted by the fans, who have also already organized many community tournaments during this Closed Beta test. Meanwhile, Riot has been tuning matchmaking and fixing bugs, and they reckon everything has held up well enough so far, giving them the proverbial green light for the next step.</p>



<p>The early access version will add Combo Trials, a full season worth of content, and also permanent unlocks; that is to say, there will be no more resets from October 7 onward.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2XKO Early Access Announcement | Dev Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_ge1A4vZ-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>There will be five seasons in 2026, each adding a new champion, Ranked reset, Battle Pass, and more. This means that 2XKO's tenth champion will be released when Early Access goes live on October 7. A dedicated gameplay reveal trailer and developer update are coming soon.</p>



<p>Being a Riot game, it's no surprise that they already have a plan for the competitive scene. To begin with, the developer is sponsoring 22 community-run tournaments in 2025 as part of the so-called First Impact Program. Each First Impact event, starting with EVO France (October 10-12), will receive a bonus from Riot, and there will be an additional prize for winning as a duo. </p>



<p>2XKO has long been known as Project L, a game spearheaded by the Cannon brothers, former developers of the fighting game Rising Thunder. The project got its final name in February 2024, when Riot also <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a 2025 release window for both PC and consoles</a>. It looks like they didn't quite make it in time for consoles, which won't be a part of this early access debut.</p>



<p>2XKO is a free 2v2 fighting game featuring iconic League of Legends champions. Players can team up with or against friends for explosive showdowns, and master a variety of unique tag and assist mechanics to defeat the enemy duo.</p>
