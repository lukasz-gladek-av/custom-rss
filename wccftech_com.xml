			<p>Just like the<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-releases-assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-gameplay-overview/"> last overview</a> Ubisoft released, it has now released a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat overview</a> for Assassin's Creed Shadows, which goes into detail about the different types of attack and defense you'll be able to use, as well as the enemies you'll encounter, and the different weapons you'll be able to use depending on which protagonist you play as. The full details of the combat overview have been posted on the official website of the game, where you'll be able to see tiny clips of the combat in action, showcasing both player and enemy attacks.</p>
<p>There are three main attack types that you will be able to utilize, regardless of whether you play as Yasuke or Naoe. As said on the website, "Remember that choosing to fight as Naoe or Yasuke - as well as your choice of weapon can alter these building blocks." While both characters will have access to Light, Heavy, and Posture attacks, it will vary for both characters depending on the weapon you choose to use. In the videos shown, the combat bears a resemblance to that of Ghost of Tsushima, where you will be able to put your enemy in a vulnerable state under certain conditions, such as a perfect dodge.</p>
<p>In Assassin's Creed Shadows, the ways to defend yourself have expanded, allowing you to Dodge, Parry, Deflect, or Block attacks. Yasuke has a slightly different Parry mechanic to Naoe, which will enable him to counterattack the enemy if he successfully parries the enemy. Naoe's deflect mechanic requires similar timing to that of the Parry, but the deflect changes the axis of combat, meaning that the enemy's flanks are exposed, but also puts Naoe in a vulnerable position if there are other enemies nearby.</p>
<p>"In essence, our core fight mechanics are the same for Yasuke and Naoe. But as a Samurai and Shinobi, respectively, they each have their own weapon types and abilities that make them feel very different from one another," says Charles Benoit, Game Director for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Naoe is more of an agile fighter who is quick on her feet and can assassinate enemies easily. However, when she comes up against more than one enemy, she is at a disadvantage, as she has significantly less armor and combat resources than Yasuke. In comparison, Yasuke is a strong warrior who can cut through his enemies with his combos. He will do significantly better against multiple enemies compared to Naoe.</p>
<p>The post also lists some of the attacks that you will have to be mindful of in Assassin's Creed Shadows, giving you advice on studying their attack patterns and tactics so that you can deal with combat, depending on what enemy you're up against.</p>
<p>As stated above, there are some little feature clips showcased in the post that show you some of the enemy attacks in action, as well as attacks from both Yasuke and Naoe.</p>
