			<p>Despite having yet to be officially revealed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5.7</a> may not be too far from release, judging from some recent discoveries.</p>



<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/theredpix">TheRedPixel</a>, an Unreal Engine 5.7 branch is already available on GitHub, while the Main branch has been bumped to 5.8, suggesting the new version of the engine shouldn't be too far from release. While we don't know when the announcement and release will happen, there's a good chance a preview may be released later this month during Unreal Fest Stockholm, which will be held from September 22 to September 24, as TheRedPixel speculates. Likewise, there's no news regarding which new features and improvements the latest version of the engine will bring, but it is expected it will include improvements to hardware Lumen as well as Nanite Foliage.</p>

And they also bumped Main to 5.8. Remember that 5.6 was delayed, as the usual time of engine ver release is around April (1st) and November(2nd).  They may release a preview around the dates of Unreal Fest Stockholm… <a href="https://t.co/lx8RRHaHC4">pic.twitter.com/lx8RRHaHC4</a></p>— TheRedPixel (@theredpix) <a href="https://twitter.com/theredpix/status/1964125325224194052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>The current version of the engine, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>, was launched in June, following the annual edition of State of Unreal. This version of the engine packs hardware ray tracing enhancements that boost Lumen Global Illumination performance, faster geometry streaming for smoother loading of massive static worlds, an intuitive redesign of Motion trails, revamped Tween Tools and redesigned Curve editor and more. The improvements made to the engine have also brought siginficant CPU and GPU improvements over version 5.4, as shown in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-significant-performance-improvements/">comparison video</a> putting a Paris Tech Demo running in UE 5.6 and UE 5.4 running side by side.</p>



<p>Hopefully, every improvement coming with Unreal Engine 5.7 will help reduce the stuttering issues prevalent in almost every game powered by the engine. One exception seems to be Silent Hill F, Konami's new entry in the survival horror series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-smooth/">as its Gamescom demo ran so well that it almost felt like it wasn't powered by UE5.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following last year's celebrations for the 50th anniversary of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D henceforth), Wizards of the Coast has slowly unveiled a bold plan in the gaming space. This coincided with a new president, John Hight, who joined the RPG, board game, and collectible card games publisher after being the 'Chief Caretaker' for World of Warcraft at Blizzard for ten years. </p>



<p>Therefore, it is perhaps not that much of a surprise to hear him speak about his desire to see a new D&amp;D MMORPG. In an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-wizards-of-the-coast-president-would-love-a-new-dungeons-dragons-mmorpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he openly admitted that he'd like to see that happen, although such a project would likely have to deviate from World of Warcraft's two-decade-old formula.</p>



<p><em>I'd love to have that. I think that we'll want to rethink what an MMO is in this day and age. I think the traditional model that Blizzard – well, even before that, Ultima Online, Everquest – pursued, that could use updating. I think in our case, it's probably a crawl, walk, run situation. We want to make sure that we've assembled the talent, we have the backend technology, we have the plans to pursue. But of course, that's a glimmer in my eye. I want to see that happen.</em></p>



<p>D&amp;D and MMORPGs are two of my favorite things in the entertainment space, so I would be lying if I didn't say how excited I am about the prospect. There are already two MMORPGs based on Wizards' IP (Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, originally released by Turbine in 2006 and now maintained by Standing Stone Games, and Neverwinter, launched by Cryptic in 2013), but they are pretty old by this point and never really got anywhere as big as the franchise deserves.</p>



<p>Still, this is not a game announcement. Hight's statement clarifies that Wizards of the Coast wants to build a tech and talent base before even attempting such a gargantuan task. Then, once the project actually gets the green light, it may take the better part of a decade before it's done, so better sit tight.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we can at least look forward to many other D&amp;D games, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>The fantasy tabletop adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, out later this year.</li>



<li>Project Baxter,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an online cooperative game in development at Starbreeze</a>&nbsp;(the makers of Payday) and scheduled to launch in 2026.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new game from Invoke</a>, formerly known as Tuque, which made the Dark Alliance game.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The recently announced action/adventure game in development at Giant Skull</a>, the studio founded by Stig Asmussen. Asmussen knew Hight from their time at Sony, before Hight's move to Blizzard, which made the partnership easier.</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, the Wizards of the Coast president also announced hiring a group of former Monolith and Cliffhanger Games developers led by Michael de Plater. That announcement only mentioned this team would incubate a 'cool new game concept' without clarifying whether it would be set in the D&amp;D IP or something new. Wizards isn't putting all its gaming eggs in the same basket, either: they've also funded <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus</a>, the Mass Effect-like RPG in development at Archetype Entertainment, and a GI Joe title in the works at Atomic Arcade.</p>
