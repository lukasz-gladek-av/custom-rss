			<p>NetEase's free-to-play superhero shooter Marvel Rivals continues to perform extremely well. Its launch month <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already great</a>, having registered over 20 million players across all platforms, but the debut of Season 1 has pushed it even further. A few hours ago, the game pulverized its <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prior concurrency record</a> (480K players) on Steam, setting a new peak at 644K online players on Valve's platform, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>The first season began just two days ago with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-begins-january-10-adds-fantastic-four-to-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrival of the Fantastic Four</a>: Mister Fantastic (who has been assigned to the Duelist class in the game), Human Torch (also a Duelist), the Thing (Vanguard), and the Invisible Woman (Strategist). The addition of these highly popular Marvel characters, who are soon getting their own movie in the MCU, is sure to be a big reason for the further surge in popularity.</p>
<p>But there's more. The developers have added an all-new game mode titled Doom Match. Here, 8 to 12 players battle on a single map, each belonging to a different faction, and all factions are hostile to each other. Players earn points by knocking out enemies, and at the end of the match, the top 50% of players by default is considered the winning side.</p>
<p>Season 1 also introduced a seasonal event called Midnight Features. Players can complete the seasonal activities to unlock limited-time rewards, including exclusive galleries, costume, spray, unit, nameplate, and more. Starting yesterday, Twitch users may even unlock exclusive Drop rewards, such as the Hela: Will of Galacta spray, nameplate, and costume, and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/unnamed-1-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Needless to say, Season 1 came with its own Battle Pass, which features more than twice the amount of content of the Season 0 pass, according to NetEase. The so-called Eternal Night Fall Luxury Battle Pass includes 10 costumes and their related content, such as sprays and emotes.&nbsp; The price for the Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass is set at 990 Lattice and players will receive 600 Lattice and 600 Units back by completing it. The good news is that the developers have introduced a mechanism for Battle Pass and Chrono Tokens that ensures that Luxury Battle Passes never expire. Moreover, Tokens purchased with Lattice are retained under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Chinese website Game Look <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an estimate of how much Marvel Rivals might have earned in its first month. They anticipated $54.5 million earned through Steam, $27.2 through PlayStation 5, and $2.7 through Xbox Series S|X. Considering that it's also available on the Epic Games Store and through its own PC client, Game Look believes total earnings outside China were around $100 million. When factoring in the estimated earnings from the Chinese version of the game, the total goes up to $136 million. Should the game keep up this pace, it could turn into a franchise capable of earning over $1 billion per year, although that would be no small feat, since live service games often experience downturns in player interest.</p>
<p>By the way, Marvel Rivals can now be played via NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud platform, and it has been confirmed that support for NVIDIA's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> tech for GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards will be coming soon.</p>

			<p>After the awesome output <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seen in 2024</a>, 2025 is setting out to be yet another great year for action games. While the next 12 months may not see the release of action games of the more straightforward variety, the highly anticipated return of some of video gaming's most celebrated franchises will be sure to provide fans of the genre with plenty of fun.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a></em></p>
<h2>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater (2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Metal-Gear-Solid-Delta-Snake-Eater.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Following Hideo Kojima's departure from Konami, it felt like the Metal Gear Solid series was done, as the Japanese publisher has since only released the multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-survive-more-than-expected/">Metal Gear Survive</a>. With the launch of the first series collection last year, however, Konami made it clear that it was time to bring back Big Boss.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is setting out not only to be an extremely faithful remake, but also a prime example of what a proper remake should be. Leaving the original story untouched, the remake of the third entry in the series, which reveals Big Boss' backstory after having been the series' main villain since its inception, will only feature, besides enhanced visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, quality-of-life improvements that promise to elevate the original stealth gameplay to new heights. If taking down enemies without being seen using everything around you to your advantage is your thing, there will be no better game in 2025 to get than Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<h2>Ghost of Yotei (2025 - PlayStation 5)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ghost-of-yotei-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/">Ghost of Tsushima</a> has been so successful that it was only a matter of time until Sucker Punch Productions brought players back to their beautiful rendition of Feudal Japan. And that time is almost upon us, as Ghost of Yotei will make its debut later this year on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the second entry in the series, but from the game's reveal trailer, it's clear how Sucker Punch will double down on everything that made the original such a great game: amazing atmosphere, tense duels, stealth gameplay, and a guiding wind that will help Yotei reach her next destination. If her final destination will truly be vengeance remains to be seen, but there's no doubt that the journey through Hokkaido will be well worth it and count among the top action games released in 2025.</p>
<h2>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (2025 - Nintendo Switch)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The silence surrounding Metroid Prime 4: Beyond since its announcement has been so deafening that it almost felt like the game would never see the light of day. Thankfully, that was not the case, and the wait for the next first-person adventure of famed bounty hunter Samus Aran is almost over.</p>
<p>Following a development reboot that brought the game back into the hands of series' creator Retro Studios, the fourth entry in the series was finally properly revealed to the world last year with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">short gameplay trailer</a> that showed just enough of what fans of the series expected to see. With an oppressive atmosphere, navigational puzzles, and a combat system that will force players to use every tool at their disposal to survive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond looks like the perfect game to bring Samus back into the spotlight following the release of the excellent Metroid Dread.</p>
<h2>Crimson Desert (Fall 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Crimson-Desert_Key-Art_2-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike every other game on this list, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">Crimson Desert</a> is a bit of an unknown. While developer Pearl Abyss has proven itself in the MMO space with Black Desert: Online, developing an open-world action-adventure game of this scope is a whole different matter, but from what has been shown so far, it looks like the Korean developer is more than up to the challenge.</p>
<p>Controlling Macduff as he traverses the continent of Pywel, which is going through political turmoil following the death of the Unifier of Lands, players will get to explore tons of different locations, ranging from the plains of Akapen to the cold lands of Kweiden, raid castles, enter dungeons to solve puzzles, befriend allies and fight foes and mythical beasts using a variety of weapons and martial arts techniques, including weapons that usually don't see much representation in games with a fantasy setting such as pistols and hand-mounted cannons, weapons that hint at how the world where Macduff will leave his mark is a lot more complex than what it seems at a glance.</p>
<h2>Grand Theft Auto VI (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GTA-VI-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While 2025 will see the release of some hotly anticipated titles, the excitement surrounding them pales in comparison to the anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI. This should be hardly surprising for anyone, as it is predicted to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>.</p>
<p>If it were any other game, however, the anticipation for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games would be completely unjustified, as we have seen very little of the game so far. Still, the return to Vice City together with the criminal duo headed by Lucia promises to be one to remember, as does the parody of contemporary American culture with the dominance of social media and influencer culture, considering what Rockstar Games achieved with its latest open-world game, Red Dead Redemption 2, and how much technology has moved forward since the release of Grand Theft Auto V back in 2013.</p>
