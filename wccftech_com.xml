			<p>Eidos Montréal <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-might-have-canceled-legacy-of-kain-game-new-layoffs-reported/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently made headlines after suffering new layoffs</a>, and information from those who left the game developer revealed that the team had been working on a canceled game set in the Legacy of Kain franchise, among others. </p>



<p>However, renowned leaker Tom Henderson stated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8RcRXnHX8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the latest episode of the Insider Gaming podcast</a> that these layoffs are not directly related to the cancellation of the Legacy of Kain game, which occurred around the same time <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new Deus Ex project was canceled</a>.</p>



<p>The latest round of cuts, according to Henderson, is instead linked to other reasons. Chiefly, despite the many cancellations, Eidos Montréal still has a big game in development that's scheduled to launch next year, which is starting to ramp down as it heads toward the end of production, leading to layoffs.</p>



<p><em>They are working internally on quite a big project. I'm not going to mention the name of it, but basically, this big project is an open world action adventure third-person game which is being created by the same team that did <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-laras-coming-of-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and it's been in development since 2019. It's gone through quite a lot of changes. That game has been in development for six years, and internally it's called P11. [...]</em></p>



<p><em>The layoffs are related to that project in particular because they are starting to ramp down the headcount now. Conceptualization and all of the systems and all that kind of stuff has been complete and they're gearing up for beta and that game is scheduled to release next year. So that's whittling down the headcount of that particular project.</em></p>



<p>If that's the case, we might be getting an announcement at The Game Awards in just a few days. That's just speculation on our part, though.</p>



<p>Other recent cuts at Eidos Montréal were seemingly related to another canceled project, a card game 'with a story spin' based on The Lord of the Rings. To give fans an idea of the number of projects that were discarded internally, according to Henderson, the developer has reached Project 22 while they still have to finish Project 11.</p>



<p>Their last project to launch was Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy in October 2021. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a great game in its own right</a>, it did not sell particularly well. Hopefully, they can secure a win with this P11 title; it would be a shame if another game ended up like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monolith Productions</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tekken Franchise Lead Katsuhiro Harada Will Leave Bandai Namco at the End of 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Katsushiro Harada, a General Manager at Bandai Namco and the man everyone identifies the Tekken series with, is leaving the company at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Truth be told, we already had an inkling earlier this year, when Harada shared on his LinkedIn page that he was 'open to work' and interested in roles such as Executive Producer, Executive Game Director, Vice President, Business Development, Business Development Executive, and Marketing. </p>



<p>When Tekken fans panicked, he <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1881164805060567212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied on X</a> not to worry about it, that he just wanted to 'meet more people' and 'expand his horizons in the future'. Now, though, there's no uncertainty <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403720328897671168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his LinkedIn message</a>:</p>



<p><em>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. [...]</em></p>



<p><em>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. [...] I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything.</em></p>



<p>Katsuhiro Harada has been involved with the Tekken franchise since the beginning of his nearly 32-year career at Bandai Namco. For the first two installments, he was credited as the voice actor for characters Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu; however, he was promoted to Game Director starting with Tekken 3 in 1997.  As he mentioned in the message, he also worked on other games, like SoulCalibur IV, Ace Combat Infinity, and Pokkén Tournament. More recently, he was also listed as a producer for games published by Bandai Namco, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/man-of-medan-rusted-seaworthy-ghost-ship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Arise</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, his final major project was Tekken 8, which received widespread critical acclaim (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earning a 9/10 on Wccftech</a>) and sold exceptionally well. The publisher would later <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-has-sold-2-million-units-in-one-month-says-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce</a> that the game sold two million units in its launch month and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-hits-3-million-sold-year-after-launch-milestone-faster-than-tekken-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached three million units</a> one year after its release, outselling its predecessor in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>As a final parting gift for fans, Harada released an hour-long TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), something he always wanted to do but never got the time for. It is available <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on SoundCloud</a>.</p>



<p>Harada will appear as a guest at the TWT Finals at the end of January 2026, having been invited by Bandai Namco. As for what's next for him, he said he'll let the fans know at a later date.</p>
