			<p>Announced in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829">September Neowsletter</a>, Slay the Spire and Slay the Spire 2 developer Mega Crit has delayed the early access release date for Slay the Spire 2 outside of 2025<em> "to a secret Thursday in March 2026</em>."</p>



<p>When Slay the Spire 2 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/">first revealed in April 2024</a>, Mega Crit had set a 2025 release window for its early access launch. Today, at the top of the newsletter, the studio confirmed that "<em>after a lot of internal discussion</em>," the decision to delay the early access launch of Slay the Spire 2 was made.</p>



<p>"<em>We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear (ourselves included, we're dying to get this into your hands!),</em>" Mega Crit continued. "<em>Originally, we were shooting for late 2025, but turns out we were wrong. We need some more time.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>There's no single dramatic reason. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards.</em>"</p>



<p>Following that opening statement, a FAQ from the studio's community manager answers a few potentially top-of-mind questions players might have after hearing the news, with the top item addressing any speculation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">Slay the Spire 2 is another game that decided to get out of Hollow Knight Silksong's way</a>. Which, according to the Mega Crit, was not the case.</p>



<p>The real answer is a mix of everything Mega Crit mentioned above. Adding new features, characters, general content, and then polishing it all so that it's ready for prime time.</p>



<p>At least in this case, Mega Crit's coy mention that it would be on a Thursday in March gives us a few options as to which one the specific date is. The real date will be revealed closer to release, but for now, you can cast lots between it being Thursday, March 5th, 12th, 19th, or 26th, 2026.</p>

			<p>Borderlands 4 is currently out on PC, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">IGN</a>, it's already become the biggest Borderlands game on Steam ever, an hour after it went live, with a concurrent player count that dwarfs the rest of its predecessors. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/">SteamDB</a>, at the time of this writing, Borderlands 4 has 201,273 players in-game. The next closest concurrent player count for games in the Borderlands series goes to Borderlands 2, which has a max concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/49520/charts/">124,678 players</a>. Borderlands 3 only has a peak concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/397540/charts/">93,820</a>.</p>



<p>Players around the world who are intending to play the game on PC can jump onto Steam or the Epic Games Store and jump into Borderlands 4 right now, while console players will have to wait a few more hours, depending on where you live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As a reminder, Steam is not a full picture of any game's player base, since we never get to see console player concurrent numbers in the same way, and as it currently stands with Borderlands 4, the game isn't even available to some console players across the world.</p>



<p>That said, this is an undeniably strong start for Gearbox's latest entry in the franchise, which is making a return after what many regarded an abysmal previous release with<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/borderlands-3/"> Borderlands 3</a>. </p>
