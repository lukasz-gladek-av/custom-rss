            <title><![CDATA[Oblivion Remastered File Size Is Reportedly Going to Be Massive]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-file-size-massive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-file-size-is-reportedly-going-to-be-massive.1169274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-file-size-massive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered file size is going to be massive, a huge jump over that of the original release and the Definitive Edition, which includes all DLC content.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, X0XLEAK revealed on X that Oblivion Remastered will be 120.94 GB big. While the file size is a huge jump of over 2000% over the original game and the Definitive Edition, it isn't particularly surprising, considering plenty of other games powered by Unreal Engine 5 sport massive file sizes. The leaker also provided proof that this is the correct file size, as it is the size Steam reports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://t.co/aX54ouFIiE">pic.twitter.com/aX54ouFIiE</a></p>
<p>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1914041212744433812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn if Oblivion Remastered will indeed require so much storage space, as one of 2025's worst-kept gaming secrets is apparently releasing<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/"> later today</a>. Even if the game is not launching before the end of the day, its release shouldn't be too far off in the future, as multiple insiders have been suggesting for some time that the highly anticipated remaster of the fourth entry in the series, developed by Bethesda, will make its debut <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">this week</a>. According to other rumors, Oblivion Remastered will also feature all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-all-dlc/">DLC packs</a> released for the original, so the remaster is really setting out to be the best way to experience one of the most beloved role-playing games of all time.</p>
<p>Besides featuring the obvious visual improvements, which have already been showcased in some leaked screenshots <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">last week</a>, Oblivion Remastered will supposedly also feature some<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/"> gameplay enhancements</a>, including an enhanced Stamina system that should make its management less frustrating, and a new blocking system inspired by modern action games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored portable PlayStation 6 will be able to run PlayStation 5 games without developer intervention, although a patch may still be needed for performance.</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-6#post-270341318"> NeoGAF forums</a>, known leaker KeplerL2 revealed today that, as far as they know, the portable system has shader binary compatibility, so it should be able to run previous-generation games without developer intervention. However, performance may not be great if games are left unpatched.</p>
<p>A portable edition of the PlayStation 6 is said to be in the works alongside the standard home variant. While the systems have yet to be officially announced, we already know they will be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">AMD</a>, like their two immediate predecessors, although Intel reportedly bid to produce the system. According to some recent rumors, the portable edition of the next-generation system by Sony will not be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-portable-edition-not-powerful-playstation-5/"> match the current generation base PlayStation 5</a>, but will be<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/"> more powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, and its SoC, which will feature less than 40 CUs, has been designed to run at very low voltages.</p>
<p>The regular edition of the PlayStation 6, on the other hand, hasn't been the subject of too many rumors, but Sony is reportedly planning to make it the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">most powerful system of its console generation</a>, expanding ray tracing and machine learning to offer advanced and innovative gameplay features.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[DOOM: The Dark Ages Just Got Its Second Official Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-just-got-its-second-official-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-just-got-its-second-official-trailer.1169250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-just-got-its-second-official-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Softworks and id Software have published the second official DOOM: The Dark Ages trailer at a rather unusual time and date, late on Sunday night (at Easter, no less). Still, it was a nice surprise for fans, to be sure, and the official YouTube channel already shows half a million views in the span of mere hours.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a cinematic trailer, not a gameplay trailer. It's entirely focused on story bits, which reflects what id Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the press</a> when they first discussed the game a couple of months ago: the plot will be more important than ever in a DOOM game. Of course, there's a lot more to DOOM: The Dark Ages, which they described as the most expansive franchise installment yet:</p>
<p><em><strong>Marty Stratton:&nbsp;</strong>It's definitely not an open world game, but it is the most expansive world we've ever built. You really feel like you're on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear DOOM to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>There's a much greater focus on progression items. We've really streamlined the economy and the currencies. I think that's another thing we learned from DOOM Eternal. If you have too many currencies and skill trees, you confuse the player. But speaking of the level design, we're very proud of it. It's some of the best work we've ever done.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 2 (4K) | Available May 15, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1i3YfGl5ag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last month, Wccftech's Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with the game at a press event</a>, and his take was very positive:</p>
<p><em>This massive battlefield was far more open than what you generally get in a DOOM title. Some trappings remained, in that you have arenas to encounter and loads of secrets to find via some exploration, but it never felt constrained by the usual corridors you come to expect. While still somewhat driven, it offered a bit of an open feel, where you could maybe find yourself at odds in one area, decide to tackle somewhere else and rearm before coming back.</em></p>
<p><em>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will launch on May 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation and path tracing</a>. There are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-phil-spencer-teases-more-multiplatform-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors of a Nintendo Switch 2 version</a>, which wouldn't be at all surprising considering that both previous games were released for the original Switch console.</p>

			<p>We might be mere hours before the announcement and simultaneous release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914036912509407602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Detective Seeds</a> (the post has now been removed <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914046038907772973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at someone's request</a>), the game could launch tomorrow at 12 PM Eastern Time. Meanwhile, the excited community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k3kq3i/page_on_virtuous_website_for_oblivion_remastered/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found traces</a> on the Bing search engine of a dedicated game page on the website of Virtuos, the studio behind the remaster.&nbsp; Whether it's really coming out tomorrow or not, multiple insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concur</a> that Oblivion Remastered should shadow drop sometime in the coming week. Let's recap its history of leaks and rumors, then.</p>
<p>In September 2023, an internal document shared as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft trial <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda planned to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 remaster, which, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-fallout-3-remaster-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is further away from release</a>, according to the latest rumors).</p>
<p>After well over a year of no further info, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report in January 2025</a> (based on the resume of a former Virtuos employee) not only discovered that Oblivion Remastered was indeed coming, but also revealed a lot of its features. It would be powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and it would feature improvements in six key areas: HUD (Heads-Up Display), Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, and Hit Reactions. Earlier this week, the first screenshots were found online on a Virtuos webpage, previewing the massive graphics improvements that players will be able to witness.</p>
<p>Now that the remaster is nearly official, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a comment from Rebelzize</a>, Project Leader of the total conversion mod Skyblivion, also scheduled to launch in 2025 after nearly a decade of work in the team's spare time. Rebelzize maintained a positive outlook, focusing on the experience gained and on the project's uniqueness instead:</p>
<p><em>Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>Are you eager to step back into Cyrodiil once again? If so, do you plan to play the official remaster or the fan-made one? Let us know below!</p>
