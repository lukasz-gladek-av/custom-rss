			<p><strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> has been one of the most controversial topics in the video game industry in recent years, and will likely continue to hold that spot for the foreseeable future. Whether you think GenAI <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">has a place</a> in game development <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">or not</a>, what's clear from game engine makers like <strong>Unity</strong> is that users who want to use it in the process of making their games will have that option.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-">GameDeveloper</a>, in Unity's <a href="https://investors.unity.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx">recent earnings call</a> for its fourth quarter financial report, not only does Unity claim that <strong>"<em>AI-driven authoring</em></strong>" is a "<em>major area of focus</em>" for the company, but it sees the potential of the technology being its ability to "<em>enable developers to <strong>prompt full casual games into existence</strong> with natural language only</em>."</p>



<p>The statement comes from Unity's chief executive officer, <strong>Matt Bromberg</strong>, who has been at the head of the company since taking over for the interim chief executive officer <strong>James M. Whitehurst</strong>, who took over from <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/"><strong>John Riccitiello</strong> after the company's abysmal runtime fee fiasco in 2023.</a></p>



<p>"<em>AI-driven authoring is our second major area of focus for 2026,</em>" says Bromberg. "<em>At the Game Developer Conference in March, we'll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform - so it's simple to move from prototype to finished product</em>."</p>



<p>Bromberg continues, "<em>This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist. We believe together this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone.</em>" </p>



<p>Bromberg would add that he believes the technology will go further in efforts to "<em>democratize</em>" game development, and "<em>remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience</em>."</p>



<p>Unity isn't the only company claiming it has GenAI technology that can make games through prompts. <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-project-genie-causes-video-game-stocks-crash/"><strong>Google's Project Genie</strong></a> (despite being a self-admitted experiment) was enough to send the share prices of major game companies plummeting. While that may have more to do with investors not understanding how video games are made and <a href="https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/">what technology like Project Genie lacks</a>, the idea of games being prompted into existence is already out there.</p>



<p>For it to now come from the company behind one of the most popular game-making engines carries far more weight than it did coming from Google, and it'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how markets react when the new beta branch is revealed at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/">GDC 2026</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Still, regardless of the stock market's reaction, it's unlikely consumers will react positively to a game that a developer admits was made entirely through prompts. Even executives pushing for GenAI technology can <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-ceo-speaks-for-gamers-says-we-dont-want-genai-slop-we-want-ai-tools-that-help-game-devs/">admit that no one wants "<em>GenAI slop</em>."</a> It's difficult to believe that the ability to prompt games into being would lead to anything but more AI-slop on gaming platforms.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that, while some executives in the industry might see GenAI as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-playable-genai-experience-ceo-says-gen-ai-transform-industry-3d/">next-best thing that'll forever change the industry</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gen-ai-had-zero-part-building-grand-theft-auto-6/">biggest video games in the industry are differentiated from the rest of the pack</a> because they are handcrafted experiences. And that's without getting into recent reports that show just how much <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/">disdain developers who are being forced to use GenAI have for the technology</a>. </p>

			<p>There's been a lot of talk lately about <strong>Sony</strong>'s formally unannounced (as of yet) <strong>PlayStation 6</strong> <strong>console</strong>. The most recent report from earlier today <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Sony is even considering <strong>delaying the PS6's tentative 2027 launch</strong> window to <strong>2028</strong> or even <strong>2029</strong>, largely due to the <strong>ongoing RAM and storage crisis</strong> that has driven component prices literally through the roof.</p>



<p>The report came from MST Financial Senior Research Analyst <strong>David Gibson</strong>, who had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> last month that the PlayStation 6 could be delayed beyond previous estimates, thus also <strong>extending the lifecycle of the current PlayStation console, the PS5</strong>.</p>



<p>But the PS6 discussion also includes the early rumors on the console's specs. Those started in earnest a few months ago, when YouTuber <strong>Moore's Law Is Dead</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> estimates from leaked internal AMD presentation slides, revealing that the PlayStation 6 was targeting <strong>34 to 40 teraflops</strong> and a <strong>massive (6x-12x) ray tracing performance uplift</strong>.</p>



<p>A month earlier, AMD leaker <strong>KeplerL2</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-performance-9070-xt-xbox-next-rtx-5080-rdna5-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had compared</a> the upcoming PS6 console with the existing <strong>AMD Radeon 9070XT</strong> graphics card, the current flagship of the so-called Red Team, with one key difference: the 9070XT is powered by <strong>RDNA 4</strong> architecture, while the PS6 would be powered by the upcoming <strong>RDNA 5</strong> architecture, which the leaker said would be <strong>even more feature-rich than NVIDIA's current Blackwell</strong> GPU architecture. </p>



<p>Now, though, KeplerL2 has clarified <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-xbox-magnus-rdna-5-finalized.1693408/post-271268469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a post</a> submitted on the NeoGAF board that the PlayStation 6 <strong>won't actually include the full RDNA 5 feature set</strong>, likely in a bid to keep costs down. KeplerL2 had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-next-gen-rdna-5-gaming-gpus-might-launch-after-nvidia-rtx-60-series-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> AMD <strong>is planning to launch the first RDNA 5 graphics cards in 2027</strong> after NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 60 Series. Up until a few months ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was also confident</a> that the next PlayStation console would launch in 2027, though he added, "<strong>unless unexpected delays happen</strong>."  </p>



<p>The PS6 is already considered to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-and-xbox-magnus-specs-finalized-xbox-performance-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less powerful than the next Xbox console</a></strong>, which <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might very well launch next year</a></strong>. If the PlayStation 6 specs remain the same, without even the full RDNA 5 feature set, and the console gets delayed to 2029, <strong>it could force hardcore users eager for next-gen gaming to switch to Xbox,</strong> and also <strong>require Sony to be very aggressive with pricing</strong> if it really comes in that late to the market. If nothing else, it would throw a little spice in a console war that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemed already done and dusted</a> in favor of Sony</strong>. On the other hand, the specs are only one component of a console war, and <strong>the PS5 also did not include all of the features from the RDNA 2 architecture</strong>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, here's what we do know will probably be in the PlayStation 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after Mark Cerny's tease</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Neural Arrays:</strong> A collection of compute units that are configured to share and process data, working together as if they were a single AI engine.</li>



<li><strong>Radiance Cores:</strong> New, dedicated hardware for ray traversal to deliver high-performance, real-time ray tracing and path tracing.</li>



<li><strong>Universal Compression:</strong> A system that evaluates and compresses all available GPU data to dramatically reduce memory bandwidth usage.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[“No One Is Safe on the Platform”: Developers Call Out Valve’s Lacking Moderation of Abuse and Bigotry on Steam Forums and Reviews]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-lack-of-steam-user-reviews-forums-moderation-called-out-by-developers/</link>

			<p>It's well known that user reviews on <strong>Steam</strong> are a mixed bag, to say the least. You'll get everything from actually thoughtful reviews to snap reactions based on less than an hour spent with the game, and often see a slew of negative reviews that are clearly part of a review-bombing campaign of players complaining about a singular issue, regardless of that issue factoring in on the game's quality.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/feb/16/bigotry-steam-pc-moderation-developers-speak-out">The Guardian</a> delves into another aspect of Steam's user reviews and forums, with developers and even some content creators speaking out about the <strong>abuse</strong> and <strong>bigotry</strong> that <strong>Valve</strong> allows to run rampant on the platform, despite several statements directly violating content guidelines set by Valve.</p>



<p>More than calling out the content itself, the issue developers and creators have is Valve's apparent unwillingness to do anything about it, offering little to no support, even with reviews that violate their own content guidelines. </p>



<p>One example included in the report describes how game designer <strong>Nathalie Lawhead</strong> wasn't able to get reviews with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alienmelon.bsky.social/post/3mbgpbpewsc2i">antisemitic comments that also mocked allegations she made regarding her sexual assault</a>, without using her public following, and ultimately, had to step outside the moderation process by directly asking someone they knew at Valve to remove the reviews.</p>



<p>Valve's moderators had cleared both reviews after Lawhead initially reported them, which prevented Lawhead from reporting them a second time, since developers cannot report a cleared review without the author editing it. The reviews were also cleared despite Valve's <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6862-8119-C23E-EA7B">user-generated content</a> and online <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct">content guides</a> citing "<em>insults or harassment</em>," "<em>discrimination</em>," and "<em>public accusations towards others</em>" as examples of what not to do in user reviews. </p>



<p>Lawhead was able to remove the antisemitic review, while the other, which, like its antisemitic counterpart, accused Lawhead of lying about their sexual assault, cleared moderation even after it had been reported by others. It was then that Lawhead was able to get it removed after speaking with someone they knew at Valve. Before Lawhead took that route, all Valve said in response to their report was "<em>We aren't in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews</em>," with Valve adding, "<em>we don't try to moderate reviews based on accuracy</em>," and claiming it was against removing reviews as it could be seen as "<em>censorship</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Everyone is at one another's throats all the time in reviews</em>," said content creator Bri 'BlondePizza' Moore. "<em>It ensures<strong> no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike</strong></em>." For Lawhead's part, getting the response they got from Valve was "<em>crushing,</em>" adding, "<em>the implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it. I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It's an obvious stance. It's a choice</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews</em>," Lawhead added. "<em>I think this entire process of moderation is <strong>broken</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Another example shared in the report describes how another developer, who did not have the kind of public following Lawhead did to fall back on, was unsuccessful in getting user reviews removed that had nothing to do with their game, and everything to do with whether the developer properly observed the assassination of Charlie Kirk last year.</p>



<p>Their game, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1785940/COVEN/">Coven</a></strong>, is a first-person shooter and action game described as a "<em>hyper-violent retro FPS</em>," and it has also been targeted by a Steam curator, '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45778915">CharlieTweetsDetected,</a>' which recommends games based solely on whether the developer has posted something negative or not about Charlie Kirk's death. The developer, who wished only to be identified as Ethan, said that Steam was not interested or didn't seeminigly care that several of Coven's negative reviews stemmed from the curator list.</p>



<p>"<em>For sure, the 'anti-woke' curators brought insincere negative attention to the game</em>," says <strong>Émi Lefèvre</strong>, a developer behind <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/">Caravan SandWitch</a></strong>, a game that has several negative reviews that call it "<em>too LGBTQ...there is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians</em>."</p>



<p>Lefèvre continues, "<em>Valve's refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalized people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought</em>."</p>



<p>One developer who tried to report transphobic reviews to Steam was told they should "<em>continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed</em>," language that was exactly similar to what Lawhead was told five years prior, showing no change or growth in its process in half a decade.</p>



<p>"<em>To us, it seemed that in Steam's [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse - but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that's welcome speech,</em>" said Phi, who received the above response when trying to remove transphobic reviews from their game. "<em>We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They're still up there today</em>."</p>



<p>Lawhead concluded, "<em>If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse. <strong>This shouldn't be normal.</strong></em><strong>"</strong></p>



<p>Valve's apparent unwillingness to moderate these reviews or even update its moderation process is only compounded as a problem when you consider that Steam is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/">largest digital platform for PC games</a>, one that <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-majority-of-game-developers-believe-steam-has-monopoly-on-pc-game-distribution/">many developers believe to be a monopoly</a>. Beyond the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/">economic issues this causes</a>, developers are forced to choose between publishing their games on platforms where Lawhead admits game publishers "<em>don't take you seriously</em>" because you're not on Steam, or stay on Steam, and endure reams of abuse. </p>
