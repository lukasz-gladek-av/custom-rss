			<p>After a last-minute, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reburn-has-delayed-la-quimera-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight-after-sending-out-review-codes/">quietly confirmed delay</a> on the day of its original intended release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/">La Quimera</a> has launched on PC in early access a week and a half later.</p>
<p>La Quimera was originally scheduled to release on April 25, 2025, and just days before that release, review keys were sent to members of the press, including Wccftech. When the release day came, shortly after reviews went live, the game was quietly delayed, with developer Reburn releasing a statement just to its Discord server on launch day.</p>
<p>The following day, Reburn posted the same statement to La Quimera's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2282350/discussions/0/597399045152010557/">Steam page</a>, and three days after that, the studio released a longer statement about the delay on the game's Steam page. It was at that point that Reburn confirmed La Quimera would be an early access release after it had originally been marketed as a complete game.</p>
<p>In a press release for today's release, chief executive officer of Reburn, Dmytro Lymar, thanked players who had been keen to play La Quimera for their support after the decision to release La Quimera in early access was announced.</p>
<p>"<em>We truly appreciate the support our community has shown since we made the decision to pivot La Quimera into Early Access. Though this wasn't our original plan, as Ukrainian game developers, we're very familiar with perseverance in the face of tough choices and tougher odds.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Our goal is to deliver a new experience that fans of our past work have come to expect now and through future updates. Thank you again to all of our supporters</em>."</p>
<p>According to the game's Steam page, Reburn intends to work on La Quimera in early access for 18 months, with the full version meant to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeper integration between narrative and gameplay in both solo and co-op modes</li>
<li>Expanded NPC involvement in story-driven gameplay situations</li>
<li>Improved pacing and balance between narrative sequences and gameplay encounters</li>
<li>Enhanced level design for combat, ensuring challenges remain engaging for both solo and cooperative players</li>
<li>A large number of levels that complete the game's major story arcs</li>
</ul>
<p>Reburn also clarified that it intends to raise the game's price from its current early access price of $29.99 USD as it adds more content.</p>

<p>I was tasked with playing La Quimera for review, and it was apparent from my time with it that it was an unfinished game. I even commented in my review that if it had been marketed as an early access game from the beginning, I would feel better about its current state. But at the time, it was described as a full release, and was simply a broken game that wasn't worth playing.</p>
<p>Now that it has launched in early access, I can't say that I feel better about its chances. I would love to see it improve over the next 18 months and release as the game Reburn first envisioned, but its issues go beyond the numerous technical problems I faced. So many things about La Quimera need not just to improve, but change completely, to come out the other side of early access as a strong, single-player shooter that can stand out in a crowded genre.</p>
<p>It didn't make a good first impression, but La Quimera has the bones of a game that could grow to be a must-play for shooter fans. This is one case where I hope I'm eating my words and the doubts I have now by the time it hits 1.0.</p>

			<p>While other major publishers across the video game industry are raising the prices of their games, EA currently says it has "<em>no changes</em>" to its pricing strategy.</p>
<p>During its investor call <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-bucks-industry-trend-and-says-it-has-no-plans-to-increase-video-game-prices">yesterday</a>, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">EA reported its fourth quarter earnings</a> and wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year, the question of game pricing was brought to EA's executive leadership. At least for now, there's no indication from chief executive officer Andrew Wilson and chief financial officer Stuart Canfield that EA plans to hike its game prices just yet.</p>
<p>"<em>In terms of pricing power, our business is very different than today than it was even just 10 years ago</em>," Wilson began. "<em>In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves, while that's still a part of our business it's a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to Deluxe Editions and beyond.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>At the end of the day, whether we're doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always delivering incredible quality and exponential value to our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is when we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow.</em>"</p>
<p>Canfield added, "<em>From a games perspective, we have reflected no changes in our current [pricing] strategy at this point</em>."</p>
<p>It's nice to hear from a big publisher like EA that it has no plans to raise prices at the moment, but that doesn't mean a price increase for its games won't happen. Right now, it's an easy win for EA to hold off on raising prices and raise them later when the rest of the industry has done so.</p>
<p>Everyone was worried that Rockstar would be the ones to smash the pricing ceiling with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but it was actually Nintendo to break through first with the price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World</a>. Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">now followed along</a> and will increase the cost of its games starting this holiday season, and even though PlayStation's next major release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, isn't getting a price increase, it wouldn't be a surprise to see their next first-party title cost an extra $10.</p>
<p>EA might not have any plans right now, but remember this in a year's time. You can bet those plans will have changed by then.</p>

			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2's motherboard and SoC has arrived today, thanks to a new video shared online which also provides some very interesting data.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today, 极客湾Geekerwan provided a new look at a real Nintendo Switch 2 motherboard and SoC, which have been removed from a unit sold on the black market before release, essentially confirming earlier rumors that suggested it was possible to get a unit way ahead of launch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-sold-40000/">exorbitant prices</a>.</p>
<p>Besides showing the Nintendo Switch 2 motherboard, 极客湾Geekerwan also conducted an interesting analysis of the SoC, summarized by ResetERA forums member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-teardown-video.1183101/post-139626573">R3ndezvous</a>, confirming that it is not only twice as large as the original Tegra X1 20nm SoC - 207mm² vs. 118mm² - but also larger than the RTX 3050 Ti mobile GPU. Tapeout year of the SoC is 2021, as annotated on the die, which also confirms <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">rumors</a> that suggested the system has been ready for release for a while. Additionally, the chip's process node is not exactly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/">8nm</a>, and in some respects, it is closer to Samsung's 10nm process.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU, 极客湾Geekerwan highlighted how it's clearly an Ampere architecture design, though it seems closer to the Ada Lovelace architecture, with an unusual layout. The YouTuber also confirmed the GPU's 6 TPC, 2SM/TPC, and 1536 CUDA Cores, a typical design for mid-range and mobile Turing and Ampere architectures. What this means for performance remains to be seen, but it's an interesting fact nonetheless that makes it difficult to predict what the console will deliver based only on PC hardware with similar specs.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nathan's preview</a>.</p>
