			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/split-fiction-amazon-mgm-studios-in-talks-acquire-sydney-sweeney-1236420431/">Deadline</a>, Amazon MGM Studios has won the bidding war to make the Split Fiction movie adaptation that is set to star Sydney Sweeney and be directed by Wicked's Jon M. Chu. Deadline reports that the deal with Amazon MGM Studios is currently being finalized, and that the whole deal is coming together for a little over $2 million USD.</p>
<p>Reports of a Split Fiction movie happening first appeared during <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">GDC 2025,</a> where Deadline points out a bidding war had begun between studios, with Sony, Amazon MGM Studios, and others throwing their hat in the ring to try and sign the project. The following month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/">we learned that Sweeney and Chu had joined the project,</a> with Sweeney set to play one of the lead characters, and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine writers, Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, set to pen the script.</p>
<p>Now, Amazon MGM Studios has seemingly come out on top, which means that both adaptations of Hazelight's biggest games, It Takes Two and Split Fiction, are being made under Amazon MGM Studios.</p>
<p>When Sweeney's involvement in the Split Fiction adaptation was announced, it was the second video game-to-film adaptation she was confirmed to be involved in that week. She has also teamed up with Michael Bay to produce a<a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/"> film based on SEGA's Out Run</a>, though as it currently stands, there's no word that she will act in the movie as well.</p>
<p>Split Fiction had a "<em>hugely successful launch</em>" <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">according to EA</a>, having sold nearly 4 million copies from its release in March to the beginning of May. It still has a long way to go to reach It Takes Two's incredible<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fco-op%2Fit-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=ab11413a772246e29f01a48816e64440&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D"> 20 million copies sold milestone</a>, but it's definitely on the path to hitting that same marker, and a film with two of the most popular creatives in Hollywood right now certainly won't hurt its chances of becoming Hazelight's second game to surpass 20 million copies sold.</p>
