			<p>Human staff have been the victim of recent layoffs over at Netflix as they begin to close down some of their game studios. This includes their triple-A development studio in Los Angeles, which was founded by Chacko Sonny, a former Overwatch Executive Producer. However, Netflix has decided to close this studio and has now admitted that the video game division of the company is investing in generative AI. This is supposedly to "accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players." This will come like an extra kick in the teeth for those who were part of the layoffs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/">the studio closure</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on LinkedIn</a>, Mike Verdu, the Vice President at GenAI for Games at Netflix, used the post to announce his new title. "I don't think I've been this excited about an opportunity in this industry since the 90s, when we saw a new game launch every few months that redefined what was possible. It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not quite certain how 'good' the AI is that is being used in game development. When it comes to generative AI that's used in artwork, it's still very obvious when the pictures are AI. Whether it be due to weird hands or same-face syndrome, there's always a level of uncanny valley. Whether this kind of thing will translate over to games as well is something that we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Verdu's statement continues with, "Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games. What you've seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition," he says. Despite that, it doesn't make the fact that a studio has been shuttered and 35 people lost their jobs any better, especially if their plan is to replace their efforts with AI.</p>
<p>At this point it's uncertain what the plan is for the use of generative AI in the video game department over at Netflix. There is a lot of possibility and potential for it, as generative AI game engines are coming out, and the AI can be used to create concept art, voice performances, in-game dialogue and much more.</p>
<p>"I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams," says Verdu.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the use of AI in the games industry? Do you think this move will work out for the Netflix game department? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-trailer-gorgeous-eva/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> won't just look like a modern game, but it will also play as one without taking away what makes the original unique, according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>
<p>Speaking with Play magazine, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-dev-says-that-konami-wants-to-make-the-remake-feel-familiar-but-not-old-our-whole-goal-is-to-make-sure-that-it-still-feels-like-the-game-that-you-played-20-years-ago/">GamesRadar</a>, the series producer commented on the remake, saying that their whole game while remaking the third entry in the popular stealth series was to make sure it still felt like the original game without making it feel like an old game. Modernizing gameplay was also somewhat forced by the improved visuals, as some of the original gameplay elements did not fit well with the remade graphics.</p>
<p>The new control scheme featured in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater plays a rather important role in this regard, giving players the chance to experience the game like never before while allowing users to also experience the remake as if it were the original. Any other change was deemed unnecessary, as it would have taken people out of the original experience. The best outcome for the remake, according to Okamura-san, is for long-time fans to still feel nostalgic while playing it.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is still scheduled for a 2024 release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, although at this point, it's clear the game will not be released this year. We will keep you updated as soon as possible on when the game launches, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
