			<p>Unity surprised everyone this morning during the <a href="https://on.unity.com/Unite2025Live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unite 2025 keynote</a> in Barcelona, Spain, when Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was suddenly called on stage to announce a partnership between the two companies behind the most used third-party game engines in the industry. </p>



<p>Sweeney said he <span>spoke with Matthew Bromberg, president and CEO of Unity (who replaced John Riccitiello after the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/" target="_blank">former CEO's resignation following the runtime fee controversy</a>), about the companies' sh</span>ared objective of supporting open digital platforms. </p>



<p>The first result of this collaboration will be that Unity's brand-new in-app purchase software development kit (SDK) will soon be available to Unreal Engine developers, allowing them to choose this API to handle cross-platform purchases. Sweeney noted that this will become even more important now that Google and Apple are being forced (after Epic's lawsuits) to open up the Android and iOS ecosystems a little.</p>



<p>Arguably, though, the bigger news is that the Fortnite ecosystem, which boasts 500 million registered accounts, is embracing games made in Unity. Sweeney said:</p>



<p><em>Fortnite is a huge game that hit 100 million monthly active users last Holiday. And though it began as a little Battle Royale game that we built, over time, it's evolved into an ecosystem where 40% of playtime is going to third-party content built by independent developers. They're earning hundreds of millions of dollars a year from participating in Fortnite, and now it's going to open up to all Unity games thanks to some really amazing network technology that Unity built that connects other engines into Unity through a networking protocol to make this work. So, starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite's discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines.</em></p>



<p>In somewhat related news, Fortnite recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-island-creators-can-test-selling-items-in-islands-loot-box-style-random-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allowed</a> Island Creators to sell items within their Islands, including random rewards that appear to be functionally similar to lootboxes.</p>

			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally received its biggest update since launch, introducing crucial system improvements, most notably to game performance and power consumption.</p>



<p>The new update, which went live a few hours ago, brings plenty of improvements, including some highly requested community features such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>New CPU P-Core and E-Core settings for the X model</li>



<li>Quick access to the full-screen mode</li>



<li>Adjusted FPS limited option from 45 to 40 FPS to better align with the panel's 120 Hz refresh rate,</li>



<li>Improved power consumption in Modern standby</li>



<li>Improved Game performance with the AMD GPU driver V25.10.27</li>



<li>Improved firmware stability</li>



<li>Overall System Performance Improvement</li>
</ul>



<p>The features above are only the highlights of the biggest ROG Xbox Ally update since the system's launch last month. All the details can be found on the <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/changelogs/changelog-november-2025-rog-ally-ally-x-xbox-ally-xbox-ally-x/ba-p/1124876">official update notes.</a></p>



<p>As battery life is usually a significant pain point for handheld devices such as the ROG Xbox Ally, power consumption improvements are quite welcome, and make the system an even more enticing purchase for those looking to get into PC handheld gaming, despite some lingering issues preventing it from delivering the same hassle-free gaming experience as consoles.

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>

			<p>Half-Life 3 fans were not nearly sated by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware announcements Valve made last week</a> (the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, all due sometime early next year). They believed before those announcements and their faith was renewed when several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> to the game's existence and potential imminent launch. Now, though, more sources have added fuel to the hype, just as the franchise celebrates the 27th anniversary since the release of the original Half-Life.</p>



<ul>
<li>Insider Nate the Hate, who has a solid track record, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990879872751735291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> that his sources also spoke about Half-Life 3. However, he received some conflicting information on the announcement timing; one of the things he heard was that it was going to happen at noon yesterday, which obviously wasn't the case.</li>



<li>Shpeshal_Nick, who has a slightly more checkered track record, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1990890439633682499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>: <em>Last week I got a DM that Valve was showing off hardware “this week” (last week) and software “next week” (this week). This software was allegedly Half-Life 3.</em></li>



<li>The Verge journalist Sean Hollister was among those invited to Valve's headquarters for the aforementioned hardware announcements. In a brief story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the website</a>, he noted that the developer's halls were strangely filled with security guards, which never happened on his previous visits. The story also included a picture of a Steam Machine visually customized with several memes, including a title that starts with H and is 'censored'. Fans took it as a tease from Valve that soon, it might not be censored anymore, at long last.</li>
</ul>



<p>Traces of a game project codenamed HLX were discovered through extensive data mining and references across Source 2 engine updates. Tyler McVicker alleged <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as early as this past May</a> that the project believed to be Half-Life 3 was almost at the end of its development. </p>



<p>Needless to say, an announcement on the anniversary of the debut installment in the franchise would make a lot of sense. Besides, Valve unveiled its upcoming hardware exactly a week ago, so if they did want to space their news evenly, today would be the day for the next announcement.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-even-black-ops-7-on-steam.1357624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has proudly announced that its latest new release, the city building strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, has registered a record launch for the franchise. There have been seven Anno installments released throughout 25 years, but none captivated the audience as much as the title that launched last week.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft Mainz (previously known as Blue Byte), Anno 117: Pax Romana secured the second spot on last week's Steam chart, beating even Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which launched only a day later. You don't have to take the publisher's word for it, as SteamDB <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1990789664811172057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the news with the following Steam Top 5 chart for the week between November 11 and 18:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6 </li>



<li>Steam Deck</li>
</ul>



<p>Granted, Black Ops 7 famously delivered its own records, albeit negative, when it comes to the Call of Duty franchise. On Steam, the game only reached a concurrent player peak of around 100K users, whereas Black Ops 6 peaked at 315K when it launched last year.</p>



<p>That has, however, little to do with Anno 117: Pax Romana, whose developers are right to celebrate. Even critical acclaim is unprecedented so far, with a Metacritic average of 85 and 94% of OpenCritic reviews recommending the game. Perhaps the most important data point is that users are playing it a lot: the average daily playtime is 3,7 hours.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Stéphane Jankowski, Executive Producer on Anno, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana officially sets sail, marking a new chapter for our beloved franchise and for everyone who poured their passion, creativity, and countless hours into it. We are humbled by the incredible response from our player. Our team remains dedicated, continuously listening to feedback and striving to deliver the ambitious Year 1 content expanding our game world to the province of Egypt!</em></p>
