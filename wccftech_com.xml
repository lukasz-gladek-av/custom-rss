			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> has more than 100 notes across all 14 chapters, and it's worth your time to find them all to get the additional story context they provide.</p>
<p>The storytelling in South of Midnight is one of the game's strongest aspects, the notes included. This guide will show you where to find all the notes in Chapter 11.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Chapter 11 is one of the lighter chapters, with only eight notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>An Anguished Cry</strong> - Early on in the chapter as you follow the path, you'll jump to a dock with exploding mushrooms covering the front end of it. Jump over the mushrooms and look to your left to find this note in the form of blue art on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Stowaway's Tin Box</strong> - You can find this note in a room on the second floor of the wrecked ship, after dealing with the Stigma knot with Crouton. Walk into the room where the Stigma knot was, and turn right to find a Floof knot and this note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bill of Fare - </strong>This note can be found on the third floor of the ship, on a table on the left side of the room, where you enter, as Hazel says she remembers the story of the boat disappearing.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Old Pain, New Life</strong> - After viewing the second memory for Ayotunde, you'll find this note as another blue painting on the tree on the left side of the combat arena.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bittersweet Reunion</strong> - After seeing the third memory of Ayotunde's past, this note will appear as blue art on rocks on the left side of the main path as you move to continue the rest of the level.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>False Knowledge</strong> - After avoiding the mud thrown by Altamaha-ha, and Honey helping you back onto the boat, you'll re-enter the boat by blowing through some pieces of wood blocking the path. This note will be on the left side of the room you enter, in the form of blue paint on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Captain's Log</strong> - You'll find this note on the right side of the room you enter after using the elevator, on a desk to the right of the boat's wheel, with a Floof knot in front of the wheel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Final Message</strong> - This last note can be found after the cutscene where Honey and Altamaha-ha meet, once again as a blue painting. It'll be on a large tree on the left side of the main path.</p>
<p>That's where to find all eight notes in Chapter 11. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 82 out of 103 notes. The search is almost over, with only 21 notes left to find.</p>

			<p>The Onimusha series may not be as popular as other CAPCOM franchises, but it remains to this day one of the most unique series ever released by the Japanese publisher. Starting out as a different take on the formula made popular by the Resident Evil series, the franchise evolved considerably until the launch of Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, the latest entry in the series, which plays slightly differently from its predecessor, doing away with the signature fixed camera angles that make the series so different from the vast majority of action-adventure games of the time.</p>
<p>With a new entry in the series called <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> on the way, CAPCOM has decided to bring the second entry in the series, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, to modern gaming platforms with a remaster that aims to faithfully recreate the original game with improved visuals and some small additions which have little impact on the experience. This is, in my opinion, not a bad thing at all, as the game has aged incredibly well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250403123231_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny remaster is so faithful to the original, which I have gone through countless times back in the PlayStation 2 days but never revisited in over 20 years, that it felt instantly familiar. So much so that I could remember how much of the stiff but incredibly charming English language script was delivered by the voice actors, awkward pauses included. I also had no trouble getting used again to some of the game's unique mechanics, which, as mentioned above, have aged so well that I have no doubt even newcomers will have no trouble getting into the game and enjoying it.</p>
<p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, much like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/onimusha-warlords-feudal-japan-evil/">predecessor</a>, is a rather unique action-adventure game that strikes a happy medium between the survival horror experience of the first three entries in the Resident Evil series and the more action-oriented approach of the original Devil May Cry, whose development started back in the day, as a new entry in the Resident Evil series. Employing the same fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds of the older entries in the popular CAPCOM survival horror series, which have been touched up and upscaled like the 3D character models in the remaster, players control Jubei Yagyu as he embarks on a journey to gather the five orbs created to protect humans from demons and defeat Nobunaga Oda, the famous daimyo and one of the three great unifiers of Japan, who has become the lord of the demons following the death of Fortinbras by the hands of Samanosuke Akechi in the original Onimusha. During the course of his journey, Jubei will encounter multiple companions who will help him, depending on his actions, and involve him in their personal stories that will evolve as he continues his war against the demon lord.</p>

<p>The epic journey depicted in Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is extremely enjoyable right from the start. In the first few hours, the game immediately shows its best cards, featuring a combination of simple puzzle solving in the vein of the Resident Evil series and fast and engaging combat against all sorts of enemies, ranging from regular humans to powerful demons, which is made extremely enjoyable by Jubei's mobility and the many techniques he can employ using the currently equipped weapon, which include the thunder katana Buraitou and the ice spear Hyoujin-yari. Unlike the original Devil May Cry, which requires good knowledge of every ability at Dante's disposal, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a little less hardcore, meaning that even newcomers will instantly have fun unleashing elemental magical attacks and avoiding enemy techniques while they get to learn the intricacies of the combat system, which features plenty of advanced techniques, including a satisfying Issen critical attack with a strict timing that can kill enemies in a single blow. The fixed camera angles, sometimes, don't provide the best view in combat, especially against the powerful but incredibly memorable boss encounters, but even this flaw is part of the charm of the experience. Combat in the remaster is greatly enhanced by a new feature that allows Jubei to switch between different weapons on the fly, removing some of the downtime of the original, as weapons could only be swapped via the menu in the PlayStation 2 release.</p>
<p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny couldn't be releasing at a better time. With the next entry in the series still a ways off, this remaster will be an excellent way for veterans to get re-acquainted with the unique quirks of the franchise as well as for newcomers to understand why the series is so beloved. Jubei Yagyu's war against Nobunaga Oda will return on May 23rd on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><em>Tested on PC. Preview access provided by the publisher.</em></p>

			<p>There are more than 100 notes to find in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, and it's worth your time to seek out all of them beyond just doing it to get the achievement.</p>
<p>Arguably, the storytelling in South of Midnight is its strongest aspect, and each note adds strong context to the storytelling that would otherwise be missed. Of course, you can still have a great time with the story if you didn't find all of them, but the experience is so much more enhanced if you do.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find all of the notes hidden in Chapter 10.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Thankfully, it's easy to clear all the notes in Chapter 10 as there are only five to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hope's Crossing Homecoming</strong> - Soon after the first combat encounter of the level, you'll reach a point where you'll see a hole for Crouton to enter to your right. Go left instead, and you'll find this note and a Floof knot waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sleep and Smoke</strong> - After Crouton grabs your first Spindle, grapple across the gap and stick to the right past some exploding mushrooms. This note will be on the wall as blue art in the broken house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Close Call</strong> - After interacting with the first firefly tree, follow the strands left and see a set of echo stairs to enter an old house. Enter the house and you'll find this note on the wall to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Grand Wedding</strong> - From the first firefly tree, go right and turn right again when you reach a bushel of exploding bramble. Directly ahead, you should see a grapple point leading to a broken-down house, where you'll find this note on the wall on the left.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Flower Child</strong> - Once you're inside Honey's home, you'll find this final note on the back wall of his cave.</p>
<p>That's where all five notes are found in Chapter 10. What's especially helpful here is that most of these notes are on the main path anyway; you just have to pay attention to the walls around you as they're all notes in the form of the blue art that's seen throughout South of Midnight.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 74 notes out of 103. Only 29 more to go.</p>

			<p>Astrolabe Interactive announced that the studio's co-op sandbox survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/aloft-by-astrolabe-interactive-scheduled-to-launch-into-early-access-on-january-15th/">Aloft</a> has surpassed 200,000 copies sold in early access since its launch in January 2025.</p>
<p>Astrolabe has partnered with <a href="https://www.coolearth.org/act-now/stream-for-cool-earth/">Cool Earth</a> to celebrate the milestone and will donate 5% of the revenue it earned during the Earth Appreciation Festival on Steam to the Cool Earth Initiative. Astrolabe and Cool Earth are also working with content creators and streamers to stream Aloft today, livestreaming the game in charity streams, and the proceeds will also go to the Cool Earth Initiative.</p>
<p>Cool Earth is an organization working to protect the world's rainforests and support the indigenous peoples who have been living and working with them, instead of against them, for generations.</p>
<p>In a press release, Astrolabe's creative director, Manuel Bergeron, discussed how Cool Earth's work and Earth Day directly relate to what Astrolabe wanted players to learn when playing Aloft.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">One of our goals in Aloft was to offer a chance for players to learn about the fragile balance of ecosystems and have a direct positive impact on their environment</span>. <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">It's our honor to contribute to the environment by giving to the Cool Earth Initiative.</span></em>"</p>
<p>Aloft's first major update in early access, Critters and Wonders, launched this past March. According to the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/543345713449272665?l=english">roadmap</a> for 2025, more major content updates and plenty of feature improvements are planned for the year, though specific release dates or windows around when that'll be have yet to be announced.</p>
