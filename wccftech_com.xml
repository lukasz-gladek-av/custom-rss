			<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> laid off <strong>9,000+</strong> people across the entire company</a>, including its gaming division. The layoffs saw studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>The Initiative</strong> entirely shut down</a>, while others like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">King</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare</a></strong> were hit by major cuts and project cancellations. At the time of the layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">former and current ZeniMax workers aptly called the cuts "<em>inhumane</em>" and "<em>disgusting</em>,"</a> so it's uplifting to see yet another studio rise up out of these cuts, as former ZeniMax developers have come together to form a new studio, <strong><a href="https://ironrootgames.com/">Ironroot Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Ironroot Games is the second studio to specifically come from former ZeniMax Online workers, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/"><strong>Sackbird Studios</strong> was formed in October 2025</a>. The news of the new team comes from an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-zenimax-online-devs-form-ironroot-games-following-traumatising-layoffs">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, where Ironroot Games' chief executive officer and creative director, <strong>Quentin Cobb</strong>, says he is still trying to work through what happened at ZeniMax Online, where he was the studio's principal gameplay designer. Cobb also goes as far as to add the word "<em>traumatic</em>"  to the list of ways to describe the cuts at ZeniMax and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a>.</p>



<p>"<em>I thought it was going well, personally, and it was shaping up,</em>" said Cobb. "<em>A thing that I struggle with is you wrap your identity up into your work. It's tough for that to get flushed down the toilet. I was there for almost five years. It's gone. All gone. It was a shock, and, to be honest, extremely traumatic</em>. <em>There are a lot of people still struggling with the ramifications of what happened that day. Blindsided is an understatement, that's for sure. It was a tough day, something that I'll never forget.</em>"</p>



<p>It's then no surprise that, after an experience like that, Cobb and fellow founding member, <strong>Elaine Gómez</strong>, who also acts as Ironroot Games' principal gameplay designer and studio culture leader, wanted to create their own space to try and avoid going through something like that again. Gómez is one of the few members of Ironroot who doesn't come from ZeniMax layoffs, but instead has their own self-described "<em>traumatizing</em>" triple-A layoff story from their time at <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/">former NetEase-backed studio, <strong>Worlds Untold</strong></a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We didn't see it coming,</em>" Gómez begins. "<em>We were told we were fully funded for the entirety of the number of years that this project was going to be on.</em> <em>We were doing great. We passed our prototype flags with flying colours. Everybody was happy with our work. And then all of a sudden it was like, right before Thanksgiving, 2024, 'Hey, everybody, we're just gonna rip the band-aid off</em>."</p>



<p>Moving forward, part of how Cobb and Gómez are trying to build a better future for themselves and their coworkers starts with Ironroot's foundation as a <strong>developer-owned</strong>, "<em><strong>people-first</strong>"</em> studio. "<em>You're not just a cog in a machine</em>," Gómez says. </p>



<p>"<em>The CEO or the top few people in the team taking a gigantic portion of the revenue, and the team getting scraps, is common practice in corporate America and it's disheartening</em>," Cobb said when discussing how he intends to be incredibly transparent when it comes to how the team is paid and the studio's revenue-sharing structure. "<em>I really feel very strongly that the people who make the game should earn the money that the game makes, period</em>."</p>



<p>As for what the studio is working on, Cobb and Gómez are keeping that under wraps for now. "<em>I'm dying to talk about it,</em>" said Cobb. "<em>But it's just so early now that I don't want to put too many details out there and then have to backtrack or change things.</em>" What they would say is that it is a "<em>personal</em>" game with a small budget.</p>



<p>While work on that first project may be a bit slower due to the studio being a small team and starting with some of its members, like Gómez, only working part-time to begin, it is heartening to see another team come up out of the mass layoffs that have plagued the industry over the last few years. Hopefully, studios like Ironroot Games and Sackbird Studios can help create a better future for the industry.</p>

			<p>Today, <strong>Loric Games</strong> announced the new early access launch date for its upcoming airship-themed cooperative survival RPG, <strong>Echoes of Elysium</strong>. As you might recall, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-early-access-release-date-loric-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to be released on December 4</a>, but there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-gets-last-minute-early-access-delay-to-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last-minute delay to January 2026</a>. The new date has now been set for <strong>January 27</strong>, although there's been no info yet on pricing.</p>



<p>Brian Johnson, the CEO and Co-Founder of Loric Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’re taking Echoes of Elysium to Early Access because we want to build this game with our community. Too often, games are built in a vacuum - developers spend years creating something in isolation, only to find the world doesn’t connect with it. We’re a small team, and rather than disappear for years and release something fully formed without player input, we want to build openly alongside our players. Early Access lets us shape Echoes of Elysium together - a survival RPG where the airship truly is your home, and where you survive and thrive in the skies. We know players joining early may encounter bugs as we continue to improve the game, and we want to reward that trust. This is about creating something together.</em></p>

<p>In a recent blog post published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2644050/view/526490645242578962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the game's Steam page</a>, Loric Games noted that early access is being chosen to make the game alongside the community. As such, systems and features will evolve over time based on the fans' feedback. They also showed some improvements to the animations and combat of Echoes of Elysium. Animations have been smoothed out, and physics are now integrated across all player outfits, constructs, and flying constructs, allowing details such as skirts and capes to trail naturally. The result is a more fluid and dynamic movement for both players and enemies. Thanks to an animation import tool, they also added new wrench attack animations. </p>

			<p><strong>Update 14/01/2026:</strong> Following the publishing of this article, a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-confirms-29-jobs-lost-at-abu-dhabi-mobile-studio">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> confirmed that Ubisoft has laid off <strong>29 developers</strong> from its Ubisoft Abu Dhabi studio.</p>



<p>"<em>In November, Ubisoft made the difficult decision to restructure its Abu Dhabi mobile studio, discontinuing some projects in order to focus on Growtopia</em>," the statement begins. "<em>As a result, this change impacted 29 team members. We remain deeply grateful for their contributions and are providing support to them throughout the transition.</em>"</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> is starting 2026 in a similar fashion to how it started 2025. The Assassin's Creed company shut down its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">Leamington-based studio in January 2025, laying off <strong>185 people</strong></a>. To start 2026, between the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">shuttering of <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong></a> and yesterday's layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/"><strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong></a>, Ubisoft has already laid off an estimated <strong>126 developers</strong>. Now, that number is definitely a little higher, as a new report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio">Game Developer</a> reveals layoffs have continued at <strong>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the report, cuts at the Abu Dhabi studio began back in December 2025 and have continued into the new year, with some staff, like former art director <strong>Daniel Kovacs</strong>, sharing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-kovacs-206b2316a_i-took-some-time-to-reflect-after-being-impacted-activity-7401147823175639040-t3WE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">his personal LinkedIn page last month that he had been laid off</a>. "<em>I took some time to reflect after being impacted by the recent layoffs at Ubisoft Abu Dhabi, and at the risk of sounding a bit sentimental, I just want to say how grateful I am for these three and a half years</em>," wrote Kovacs.</p>



<p>"<em>Signing off as Ubisoft Abu Dhabi's social media manager as I've been affected by the recent layoffs</em>," added <strong>Raiza</strong> <strong>Veridiano</strong>, who also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7400125428398485507-ZyjH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared the news that they had been laid off last month</a>. "<em>I’m incredibly grateful for the 4 years and 9 months I’ve spent here.</em>"</p>



<p>Other former staff, like game support specialist <strong>Zohaib Shafiq</strong>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zshafiq_opentowork-opentowork-ubisoft-activity-7416772579723665409-Xgp6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared the news only yesterday,</a> indicating that the cuts have continued into 2026. "<em>Due to recent restructuring, my journey at</em> <em>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi is coming to an end after an amazing 4.5 years. It’s been a chapter full of learning, collaboration, and growth; I am incredibly grateful for the experiences, challenges, and people that made this chapter so meaningful.</em>"</p>



<p>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi has a team of 60 people, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/locations/abu-dhabi">according to its website</a>, which also calls the studio "<em>Ubisoft’s Regional Hub for games development</em>" in the area. The Abu Dhabi team is responsible for titles like Growtopia and CSI: Hidden Crimes.</p>



<p>According to Ubisoft, these cuts are part of  "<em></em><em>company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>." Last year, the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">established a new branch with <strong>Tencent</strong> called <strong>Vantage Studios</strong></a>, which is now the home to the company's most significant IPs, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>
