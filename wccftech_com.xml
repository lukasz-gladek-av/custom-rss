			<p>Unreal Engine 5 adds complexity in some interesting ways that allow the development of games that may not have been possible before but at a cost on PC that will likely only get mitigated in the future by brute forcing better performance.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broke Silicon podcast, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk discussed Unreal Engine 5 at length, highlighting the many issues developers face with the engine but also how it adds complexity in ways that is allowing them to do things that maybe couldn't be done before, but with a base cost that was, at launch, two GPU generations behind in terms of performance, a really unsurprising statement considering we have seen, time and time again, how Unreal Engine 5-powered games don't seem to run well even on top-end hardware. On consoles, things are quite different, according to the developer, as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S have dedicated hardware, such as their IO controllers, that handle data compression and decompression. On PC, on the other hand, there are a lot of data bottlenecks that prevent the process from being smooth, and, as of now, it seems like performance will only get better with the faster interface and CPUs, essentially brute forcing through the issues, getting to the point where latency will be so low and the interface speed so fast that things will get better at least until the next generation of consoles. As such, it may be until the RTX 6000 series when Unreal Engine 5 will run as it should on PC.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine 5 creator Epic is well aware of the performance issues in games powered by their engine and has recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-shader-compilation-systems-prevent-stuttering-not-work-properly/"> outlined</a> what the engine features to mitigate the issues and what they are currently working on to further improve the situation. Some of these systems, however, don't seem to be working properly out-of-the-box, and require developer intervention, so there's definitely more work to be done until shader compilation and other performance issues become a thing of the past in UE5 games.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5. You can learn more about some of the features it introduces, including the Nanite of lights, MegaLights, by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">here</a>.</p>

			<p>The official PC system requirements for Lost Soul Aside have been revealed, confirming the system configurations that can run the game at different quality settings and with ray tracing.</p>
<p>The system requirements for running the game without ray tracing look reasonable enough for a game launching this year, as players will need either an Intel i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU and either an RTX 3070 or RX 6800 XT to run the game at the high preset, although with an unknown target resolution and framerate. The requirements unsurprisingly become more demanding with ray tracing, as an RTX 5070 Ti GPU will be required for the Ultra Ray Tracing preset.</p>

<p>In addition to confirming the game's system requirements, the Lost Soul Aside PC page on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-soul-aside/lost-soul-aside-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official PlayStation website</a> also confirmed that the game will support performance-boosting technologies, such as NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR, DualSense controller, and HDR support.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/">May 30th</a>. Unfortunately, the game won't be available on PC in <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-is-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam-despite-playstation-network-account-sign-in-no-longer-being-mandatory/">countries where the PlayStation Network is not available</a>, despite PSN account log-in being no longer mandatory.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-remasters-could-be-announced-on-the-franchises-20th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We first <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-rumored-to-be-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> rumors about the God of War Greek saga remaster plan in October 2024. That rumor suggested Sony Santa Monica would be working with Nixxes Software to enhance the beloved original trilogy for modern hardware.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckoned</a> the announcement would come at the February State of Play, but that turned out to be incorrect. Now, insider Jeff Grubb has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bdacp2cmuuyawx553cv2spdy/post/3liqdacmdnc23?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the news could be officially confirmed in time for the franchise's 20th anniversary. This would land on March 22, which marked the original game's debut in North America (Europe, as was customary back then, had to wait until July 7).</p>
<p>We don't have any details on what would be included. However, we can guess there would be significant graphical improvements over the previous remasters (the first two games were remastered for PlayStation 3, and the last one for PlayStation 4), as well as possibly some quality-of-life enhancements. It is highly unlikely that it would be anything more than that, as that'd make it more of a remake than a remaster, and the scope of a full-fledged remake of the God of War trilogy would be massive.</p>
<p>It's interesting that Sony would be willing to bring those games back to the market once again. While they do serve as a backstory for Kratos as we've seen him in the Norse mythology continuation, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV series adaptation in the making at Amazon Prime Video</a> will be based on the latter, not on the Greek saga. As a reminder, the adaptation was originally meant to be led by Rafe Judkins, but the showrunner left the project and was replaced in late 2024 by Ronald D. Moore, who is known for his work on acclaimed TV shows like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, and For All Mankind.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful launch of Avowed</a>, Pillars of Eternity creator Josh Sawyer did an LA Wild Fire Relief Stream yesterday <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2388422071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Obsidian's Twitch channel</a>. During the lengthy stream, he played the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released game</a> and talked about various topics.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sawyer revealed that there's quite a lot of interest within the team to make a 'Pillars Tactics' game, although there is uncertainty about its commercial success.</p>
<p><em>Pillars Tactics is a thing that a lot of people at the studio would like to work on, and there are a lot of people who like tactics games. Figuring out a scope for it is tricky. A scope of development where it feels like it could actually make money, because tactics games have a very enthusiastic fan base, but the fan base is not humongous. It's sort of like that floor is high - like, if you make a decent tactics game, those people are going to buy it. But if all of them buy it, that's still not that many people.</em></p>
<p>Over a year ago, following the incredible success of Baldur's Gate 3, Sawyer <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> he'd love to do a more tactical, turn-based Pillars of Eternity 3 if Microsoft would only provide the triple-A budget for it.</p>
<p><em>I think that would be a lot of fun to do, to do like a high production value party based fantasy RPG. Iâ€™m pretty happy with Pillars and Deadfire, but I do think that if it were not crowdfunded, I would probably make it turn based. Iâ€™m not saying to not have a real time with pause system, but I do think that the Deadfire turn based system which I canâ€™t take credit for, that Nick Carver and Brian MacIntosh did, was really cool. But, the game wasnâ€™t designed for it, so actually designing the game for turn based, fewer encounters, smaller encounters, but much more tactical, I think that would be a lot of fun, and having awesome cinematics and all that stuff.</em></p>
<p>Still, as things stand, it seems more likely that Obsidian will continue making first-person action RPGs like Avowed and the upcoming The Outer Worlds 2, which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch sometime this year</a>.</p>
