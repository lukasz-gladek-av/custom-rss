			<p>If you were unaware, <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award">Gamescom</a> has its own set of awards given out at the annual event that are voted on by members of an independent jury, with the purpose of the awards being "<em>to honor outstanding games, extensions, exhibitors, booths, merch, as well as announcements and trailers</em>," per the <a href="https://media.koelnmesse.io/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/gamescom-award/regulations.pdf">awards regulations</a>. For <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, there was a clear winner, with Capcom and Resident Evil Requiem hogging the spotlight and being one of three games to take home multiple awards.  </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem took home wins for Best Visuals, Best Audio, the Most Epic Game, and the Best Sony PlayStation Game at this year's show. The only other titles to grab multiple awards were Hela, an indie game that won Most Entertaining and Most Wholesome, and Anno 117: Pax Romana, which won Best PC Game and Best Booth, though technically that last one goes to Ubisoft for the Anno 117: Pax Romana booth.</p>



<p>The other notable win in this year's awards was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> taking home the prize for Best Trailer, which was one of the few awards not voted on by the pre-selected jury, but by the general public.</p>

			<p>First-person survival horror game Stygian: Outer Gods, which launched in early access this past April, has just received its first major content update in its early access journey titled Souls of the Silent Tide. </p>



<p>The new update was released alongside a new trailer, showcasing the introduction of the House of Mists and some of the new horrors that players will experience in Souls of the Silent Tide.</p>



<p>Souls of the Silent Tide will have you carefully treading through the ritual site of head witch Agata, though there's also a secret area that you'll have to explore to find, as developer Misterial Games doesn't want to spoil that surprise.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You'll also meet new characters, and face a few new enemies to defeat, alongside some you're already familiar with that have been given a bit of an updated moveset.</p>



<p>Souls of the Silent Tide also includes a new weapon for players to stand against these horrors with, and the update includes the first boss fight that's been added to the game.</p>



<p>If you've not yet checked out Stygian: Outer Gods, this update is a good time to check it out, not just because you'll have what was available at launch, plus this new chunk of content to play through, but because as part of the update's arrival, Misterial Games is discounting Stygian: Outer Gods for a limited time with a 20% discount.</p>



<p>After the sale however, Misterial Games and publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-smoke-and-mirrors-update-july-17/">Fulqrum Publishing</a> confirm that the price of the early access release will actually increase to $24.99 USD / 24.99 EUR / 20.99 GBP. </p>
