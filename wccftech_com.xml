<p>Mortal Kombat 1 was reviewed well among critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mortal-kombat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it got an 8.5/10 here on Wccftech</a>), though it is noticeably slower in sales than its predecessor, Mortal Kombat 11, which reached the remarkable milestone of 15 million units in October 2022, roughly three and a half years after its debut. MK1 still has a year and a half to go, but it seems unlikely it could sell another 8.8 million units, even with deep discounts. </p>
