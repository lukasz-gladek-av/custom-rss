			<p>Finally, during last night's busy The Game Awards 2024 show, Pearl Abyss announced the release window for Crimson Desert. We first&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard </a>about the game at G-Star 2019, when it was presented as a spiritual sequel to the studio's Black Desert featuring similar MMO elements.</p>
<p>The following year, the South Korean developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a switch from MMO to open world action/adventure while also sharing a preliminary Winter 2021 target window. Needless to say, that did not pan out, and Pearl Abyss actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> Crimson Desert indefinitely. It wasn't until Gamescom 2023 that the game re-<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerged</a> with a new trailer. In late 2023, Korean media <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a new Q2 2025 launch window.</p>
<p>That prediction wasn't far off, as Crimson Desert is now officially set to launch in Fall 2025 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/CRIMSON_DESERT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> (including Mac, according to the press release), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/crimson-desert/9ng592g0w474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is now available on all platforms.</p>

<p>Pearl Abyss also shared a bit more about the game's features. Players take the role of Kliff, leader of the Greymanes, a band of battle-hardened mercenaries who fight to save the land of Pywel from impending disaster. As they explore the vast landscapes, players will engage in intense battles, defeat formidable monsters, collect valuable loot, and follow the story of the Greymanes' journey.</p>
<p>The developers are promising a strategically rich combat experience, whether you're fighting an intense one-on-one duel or battling through massive hordes of foes. Crimson Desert will feature 'monumental boss fights' that, once complete, unlock unique weapons and armor or even new abilities. Kliff can also soar through the skies by commanding, riding, and controlling wyverns for thrilling aerial combat.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert is powered by the next-generation BlackSpace Engine, featuring dynamic weather, time, and environmental changes. From a gameplay standpoint, players will be able to enjoy rock climbing, gliding, fishing, cooking, and so much more. They will encounter mechanized villages, intricate puzzles, and interactive aerial Abysses that promise 'endless discovery'.</p>
<p>The Steam page also listed the minimum and recommended system requirements, which we've added below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dog%E2%80%99s-new-sci-fi-ip-coming-to-ps5.1060458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Every edition of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> needs a headliner announcement, and this year, it was Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Don’t recognize that name? You shouldn’t, it’s a new IP, but you will recognize the developer – <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naughty Dog</a>.</p>
<p>The first teaser trailer for Intergalactic is light on details, but we are introduced to Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who’s tracking a quarry to the dangerous planet of Sempiria. Most of the trailer is focused on showing off Jordan and Naughty Dog’s always-cutting-edge facial animation tech, but we do get a hint of what gameplay might be like at the end of the video as we see our hero taking on a robotic enemy with a laser sword. So, it looks like the focus is on melee combat and the inhospitable planet hints at perhaps survival elements. But enough of my preamble, take a look at Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Consider me intrigued! We’ve known for a while that The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann’s next thing would be a new sci-fi IP, and this is obviously it. We don’t know yet if Druckmann is actually writing and/or directing Intergalactic but his name is attached to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/12/announcing-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-a-new-franchise-from-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a> that reveals a bit more info about the game…</p>
<p><em>“Intergalactic stars our newest protagonist, Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. In fact, anyone who’s flown to it hoping to unravel its mysterious past was never heard from again. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, we’re keeping everything about the story under wraps – at least for now. What we can tell you is that this game lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey. Our narrative goals are rivaled only by our gameplay ambitions. This will be the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history, taking our learnings from our previous franchises and pushing them beyond anything we’ve ever done before.</em></p>
<p><em>Jordan is played by the talented Tati Gabrielle, who leads a stellar cast (pun intended!). Eagle-eyed players might spot some of the other cast members in the trailer. We’ll reveal more of our ensemble down the line. Our incredible voyage into the cosmos also needs an equally incredible soundtrack. As tremendous fans of their work, I’m excited to announce our collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who’ll be scoring Intergalactic! The guys are cooking, and the trailer is just a small tease of their work for the game.”</em></p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet has been announced for PS5. A release window has yet to be revealed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/okami-is-getting-a-sequel-with-hideki-kamiya-once-again-taking-the-reigns.1060398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Late last year, Devil May Cry and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya made the surprising announcement that he was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving the studio he co-founded, PlatinumGames</a>. At the time, we didn’t know what Kamiya’s next step might be, but now we do. Tonight at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards</a> we got a first peek at a revival of another beloved Kamiya creation – Okami.</p>
<p>At present, the new game doesn’t have an official title, it’s simply being referred to as “Okami Sequel.” The brief teaser trailer shows Amaterasu running across a large open field, perhaps implying the new game’s world will be expanded compared to the original. While the visual style of the game has been updated somewhat, it still definitely has a “painted” look. And yes, at the end we get the words “Game Director Hideki Kamiya” so now we know why he left Platinum. The new game will be produced at Kamiya’s new studio Clovers, a revival of sort of Clover Studio, which created the original Okami. But enough of my preamble, check out the teaser for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Okami sequel - Project Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSoZgCCxyQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like most folks with good taste, I enjoyed Okami a lot, so I’m definitely excited to see a new one. Here’s hoping Kamiya has another classic in him. Here's a bit more information about the project, directly from Capcom...</p>
<p><em>"The Okami sequel project is underway!! Okami is a game critically acclaimed for its unique world, heartwarming story, and exciting adventures. Now, a new adventure in the same vein as Okami has been set in motion.</em></p>
<p><em>Hideki Kamiya, director of the original Okami, will be the director of this project, which is being co-developed between studios that include various staff members of the original Okami: M-TWO Inc., Machine Head Works Inc., and CLOVERS Inc., which Hideki Kamiya is a member of.</em></p>
<p><em>What will the new adventures of Amaterasu and company be like? It will be some time before we greet you again, but we really hope you look forward to this project."</em></p>
<p>Platforms and a release date for the Okami Sequel have yet to be announced. What do you think? Excited to break out the paintbrush again?</p>
