			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-reclaims-no1-as-ea">The Game Business</a>, backed by <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD data</a> shows that for last week's EU video game sales (October 19-26), Battlefield 6 has taken back the top spot after Pokémon Legends Z-A <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">had it for its launch week.</a> Legends Z-A drops to third, with EA Sports FC 26 keeping its top-three spot on both the units sold and revenue earned sales charts.</p>



<p>After Pokémon Legends Z-A took the top spot for its launch week, with Battlefield 6 in second and EA Sports FC 26 in third, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-eu-launch-sales/">Battlefield 6 is back on top</a> with EA Sports FC 26 in second, and Pokémon in third, with regard to units sold. However, this is the point where it should be noted that Nintendo does not share digital sales data, and that the numbers GSD uses are only based on physical sales.</p>



<p>Every other entry on the top ten list for revenue and units sold that's not a Nintendo game is based on both digital and physical sales, so while it's possible that Pokémon Legends Z-A could remain in third place if we had a complete picture, it's also a safe bet that Legends Z-A has in fact remained at the top spot in the charts when including digital sales.</p>



<p>But we don't have the digital sales data, so as it stands, the top three are the same for the revenue earned charts. Beyond the top three, both charts start to show discrepancies, some more significant than others.</p>



<p>Like how on the units sold charts, Ninja Gaiden 4, one of the many major releases in October, is nowhere to be found. The same goes for The Outer Worlds 2; however, both games earned a spot in the top ten for revenue earned, with Ninja Gaiden 4 making the list in the number six spot and The Outer Worlds 2 squeezing in at the number nine spot.</p>



<p>There are also three games on the units sold charts that don't make the revenue charts, and only one of them is a new release. That marker goes to Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted, which makes the units sold top-ten at number six and then just below Grand Theft Auto V, in the number eight spot is Titanfall 2, which jumps up 3,688% compared to where it was on the charts a week prior.</p>



<p>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is another that made huge leaps to make it into the top ten at the number ten spot on the units sold charts. Both leaps are impressive on the face of it, though slightly less impressive when checking their price history via SteamDB, which shows that both <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237970/">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1328670/">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> are coming off a major sale where they were both 90% off, making the cost for one of the best shooters of all time and one of the best RPG trilogies of all time the price of a coffee to pick up, if you didn't already own them.</p>

			<p>At the time of this writing, Heart Machine, the studio behind games like Hyper Light Drifter, Solar Ash, and more recently, Hyper Light Breaker, is less than two weeks from releasing its next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-next-game-possessors-release-date-november-pc-ps5/">Possessor(s)</a>. It's also reportedly just had its second wave of layoffs in less than a month.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">Game Developer</a>, after the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-layoffs-hyper-light-breaker-development-ending/">confirmed a wave of layoffs at the beginning of October</a>, along with halting further development on Hyper Light Breaker, more former developers from Heart Machine have taken to social media to confirm that they've been laid off in a second wave this month.</p>



<p>At least four now former Heart Machine developers took to Bluesky to confirm they have been laid off, with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yiyiwzhang.bsky.social/post/3m4dxhba5ds2x">one even posting a video</a> where they paint a particularly dark picture of the shape the studio is in, saying, "<em>Heart Machine has just laid off a bunch more people, effective immediately. By the time Possessor(s) comes out on November 11th, I don't know if anyone who worked on the game will even be at the company anymore</em>.<em> That's game dev.</em>" The post captions the video "<em>Layoffs at Launch: that's game dev</em>."</p>







<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mllepilgrim.bsky.social/post/3m4c2kazjfk2n">Another post reads</a>, "<em>My heart is heavy and I might have more to say on that later, but I've got news today that my time at Heart Machine will come to an end after Possessor(s) ships. I'm honestly too busy...literally shipping the game to start actively looking for work, but I'll be looking for my next gig in December</em>."</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/virum.bsky.social/post/3m4dmk3tgqs2w">One of the developers impacted by the layoffs</a> had been with Heart Machine for nearly six years before being cut this month. Beyond those who've posted, it is unclear how many developers have been impacted in this round. The studio has yet to make a formal statement akin to the one it made earlier this month, although with the launch of Possessor(s) so close, the studio may just be waiting until after the game has launched to comment further on its status.</p>



<p>Game Developer also pointed out that this isn't just the studio's second layoff in less than a month, but also <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">its third layoff in less than a year</a>.</p>



<p>To call these layoffs 'unfortunate' barely covers it. Heart Machine is a rarity in the modern industry as an indie studio that has stuck around for over a decade, with Hyper Light Drifter being one of the more beloved indie games in the last fifteen years. Now, it seems to be barely getting Possessor(s) out the door; its follow-up to the indie game that put the studio on everyone's radar will never really leave early access, and it doesn't feel unrealistic to say the studio might not make it to the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Hopefully, of course, that's not the case and the studio can find a path to survival once Possessor(s) has launched.</p>
