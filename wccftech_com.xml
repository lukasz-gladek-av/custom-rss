			<p>At the beginning of the month, Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/">announced</a> that Druckmann would be stepping away from his role with HBO's The Last of Us, to put his full efforts back to his day job, being the studio head of Naughty Dog and working on their next project, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-casey-bloys-the-penguin-season-2-the-last-of-us-future-1236461127/">Variety</a>, HBO chairman and chief executive officer Casey Bloys spoke about what Druckmann's departure means for the show from their perspective, and for Bloys, Druckmann leaving the show doesn't seem to be a huge concern. </p>



<p><em>"Obviously it was great to have Neil involved in the beginning</em>," Bloys began. "<em>The whole reason that I wanted to do 'Last of Us' is after 'Chernobyl,' I said to Craig [Mazin], 'What do you want to do next?' And 'Last of Us' was what he wanted to do. That's what was most important to me, Craig's creative excitement about the show. It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don't realize that Neil has a full time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. It's a really big job that he's got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that. But I believe he's given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we'll be in excellent shape. I'm not worried at all.</em>"</p>



<p>Bloys continued to say that season 3 of the show is slated to arrive in 2027, and whether there will be a fourth season is up to showrunner Craig Mazin. "<em>I'm following Craig's lead on that</em>," Bloys said.</p>



<p>Druckmann's departure might be cause for concern for some viewers, but it's not surprising that Bloys isn't outwardly concerned, especially since the show was just<a href="https://www.televisionacademy.com/files/assets/Downloads/77thnominations-list-v1.pdf"> nominated for 16 Emmy Awards</a>, bringing the series total up to 40 nominations between two seasons.</p>



<p>Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal both picked up Emmy nominations for lead actress and actor in a drama series, respectively. Kaitlyn Dever also picked up a nomination for outstanding guest actress in a drama series, while the overall show was nominated for outstanding drama.  Other notable nominations among the 16 include nominations for prosthetics and makeup, special effects, and Catherine O'Hara also getting a nomination for her guest role in the show. </p>



<p>Any major production is a team effort, and while Druckmann's involvement was clearly an important part of the show's first two seasons, it's not like it earned 40 Emmy nominations based on Druckmann's efforts alone. There's a whole team of people who are making this show, and it'll be interesting to see how Mazin continues the story, without Druckmann leaning over his shoulder and weighing in on the details as much as he might've been for the first two seasons.</p>



<p>And players can rejoice over the fact that, hopefully, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will arrive on time in its current release window slated for 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a little less than two years at the time of this writing since Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/">confirmed</a> that it was making a movie adaptation of The Legend of Zelda, which means nearly two years of fans around the world discussing who they'd pick to play the titular Zelda, and everyone's favorite mute protagonist, Link. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, we learned when the movie would be out in theatres, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-live-action-movie-slated-for-march-26-2027/">initially pinned</a> with a March 26, 2027, release date. Last month, however, Nintendo announced that it would no longer be out in March 2027, and shifted the date a few weeks into May, with the new date set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-the-live-action-zelda-movie-release-has-been-delayed-a-few-weeks-from-march-2027-to-may-2027/">May 7, 2027</a>. </p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335">statement</a> from Nintendo president Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo has announced who will be playing Zelda and Link in the live-action adaptation. For Zelda, it'll be 21-year-old Bo Bragason, while 16-year-old Benjamin Evan Ainsworth is stepping into the tunic of Link.</p>



<p> "<em>This is Miyamoto</em>," the statement began. "<em>I am pleased to announce that for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, Zelda will be played by Bo Bragason-san, and Link by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san. I am very much looking forward to seeing both of them on the big screen</em>."</p>

<p>The images shared already appear to be showing them as their characters, with Bragason in a blue top reminiscent of Zelda's classic blue dress, and Ainsworth in a dark tunic, though it's not necessarily the bright green that players would recognize as distinctly part of Link's costume. </p>



<p>As a fact of their age and the number of credits listed on each of their IMDB pages, both actors are early in their careers, making the roles they'll play in this film the most prominent parts they've had so far. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the cast is developed around them, and the direction Nintendo takes with this film, the more we learn about it.</p>
