			<p><strong>FYQD</strong>, the one-man studio led by <strong>Zeng Xiancheng</strong> and known for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bright-memory-infinite-interview-zeng-on-raytracing-next-gen-and-december-target-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bright Memory Infinite</a></strong>, has announced a new game. In a tweet <a href="https://x.com/FYQD_Studio/status/2006553505306489063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on X</a>, he said the currently untitled project is a third-person action shooter game set during the historical period of the <strong>Republic of China</strong>, 'amidst a time of turmoil and collapsing order, rival gangs clash in the shadows, as violence and conspiracy quietly spread through the streets.'</p>



<p>The Republic of China was formally established at the beginning of <strong>1912</strong>, following the <strong>Xinhai Revolution</strong> that ended <strong>over two thousand years of imperial history</strong>. It lasted until <strong>1949</strong>, when the Kuomintang-led government was ultimately defeated in the <strong>Chinese Civil War</strong> and forced to retreat to <strong>Taiwan</strong>, while the <strong>Chinese Communist Party</strong> assumed control of the mainland and founded the <strong>People's Republic of China</strong>.</p>



<p>It is certainly a unique setting for a videogame. Most titles set in China are based on much earlier eras, such as the <strong>Three Kingdoms (AD 220–280)</strong> (by far <a href="https://wccftech.com/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-to-launch-on-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most used setting in games</a>), the <strong>Tang Dynasty (618–907)</strong>, and the <strong>Ming Dynasty (1368–1644)</strong>. Indeed, when FYQD shared the news on the Chinese social network <strong>Bilibili</strong>, a user advised him 'not to touch' the subject matter, as 'getting involved with real history is never a good thing'. The Bright Memory Infinite developer replied:</p>



<p><em>The story and all aspects of this work are fictional and have no connection or association with actual historical events. It merely uses the Republican era as a background setting. The focus of the game is on third-person action shooting.</em></p>



<p>Depending on the story's depiction, it could indeed attract scrutiny from the Chinese government. However, FYQD is undoubtedly aware of that, and it does not sound like he's planning to make the game controversial.</p>

<p>The developer also posted a few gorgeous in-game screenshots of the game on social media. That's not much of a surprise, though, as his graphical skills were already shown in Bright Memory Infinite. Be prepared for a long wait, though: this seems to be a way more complex project.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the studio's previous game is now <strong>50% off on Steam</strong> and <strong>30% off on the PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo stores</strong>. Over 90% of the global Steam user reviews are positive, and sales estimates based on SteamDB project a range between 1.18 million units and 2.32 million units sold on Valve's platform.</p>
