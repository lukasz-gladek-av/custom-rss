			<p>Amazon's Fallout TV show was praised for a number of things, one of them being how well the creative team behind the show was able to recreate the world of Fallout for the small screen. Beyond the performances and the characters, it was a huge boon to see how much everything looked and felt like it was right out of the game, and thanks to some eagle-eyed fans, we know that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/">Mass Effect</a> show could look just as good. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Eurogamer</a>, writer <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">Daniel Casey,</a> who is penning the scripts for the Mass Effect adaptation and operating as an executive producer on the show, shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCIXbiuSR5R/?igsh=a2IydzBvYmVwNGFp">last November in an Instagram post</a>, that the majority of the production team behind Fallout, will be working with him on Mass Effect. </p>



<p>"<em>I'm working on a Mass Effect show for Amazon</em>," Casey wrote. "<em>We're greenlit to start our writer's room at the top of 2025. Doing this right is and has been top priority for nearly two years now (though we paused for the strike last year). We have a great pilot script and series outline, the team that Amazon has in place (same team as Fallout including the fantastic Scott Farris) is incredible. Standby for further updates. This is gonna be the next year/two years of my life. And it'll be special</em>."</p>



<p>This doesn't ensure that the Mass Effect TV show will have the entire right look and feel, or that the characters will be stellar, or that the show will be a hit overall, but it does give the show a big leg-up. Mass Effect and Fallout are similar in that they both exist within expansive worlds, where multiply stories can be told without ever treading on the same ground the game's have already walked on. </p>



<p>It's a boon to see that many of the same people who understood the asssignment in adapting Fallout are also going to be working on Mass Effect. Hopefully, we'll learn more about the series soon.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-tease-horror-game-hellraiser/">Last week,</a> Saber Interactive teased a new horror game that was set to be revealed this morning, and almost immediately, players picked up on it potentially being a Hellraiser game. Well, today we found out that those suspicions were correct, as Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games announced a survival horror Hellraiser game, called Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival.</p>



<p>In an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/22/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival/"> Xbox Wire</a> post, executive producer on Hellraiser: Revival, Nenad Tomic, describes the game as "<em>single-player, survival horror action game</em>," and as a "<em>story-driven</em>" game where players will step into the role of Aidan. As the trailer teases at the start, when a mysterious puzzle box, the Genesis Configuration, pulls his girlfriend Sunny into the hands of Pinhead, it's Aidan's job to save her, using the box to pull her out of the Labyrinth and bring her home. Presumably so they can continue where they're interrupted in the trailer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Clive Barker, who fans will recognize as the writer behind The Hellbound Heart, the book that he eventually adapted to the first Hellraiser film, has "<em>been deeply involved with the game from the very beginning</em>," according to Tomic, as Barker has been helping guide Saber's hand "<em>from the visual style and story motifs to the lore and the character personalities, his creative input has ensured that the game remains authentic to the spirit of Hellraiser</em>."</p>



<p>In a press release for the game's reveal, Barker added, "<em>Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings. The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding Hellraiser lore, Tomic continues that this game borrows from the first two Hellraiser films, but is a new story in the world of Hellraiser, and does not have a direct narrative connection to the films. Fans of the series will however recognize elements of the Hellraiser world, including of course the Genesis Configuration, and the Cenobites.</p>

<p>While Tomic stops short of saying when Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival will be out on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, he does say that "<em>it's closer than you think</em>," and adds that more of the game will be shown later this year. Which means we could be looking at a late-2025 release, and since it's a horror game, there's always the possibility that it is aiming to be out sometime in October. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 577.00) optimized for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers</a> and Killing Floor 3. Both PC games are scheduled to launch on July 24.</p>



<p>The first one, developed by Leenzee and published by 505 Games, is a soulslike action roleplaying game set in the land of Shu during a fantasy rendition of the late Ming dynasty (seventeenth century). In WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, the land is plagued by warring factions and a mysterious illness that spawns monstrous creatures. Players take the role of the titular Wuchang, a skilled pirate warrior afflicted with amnesia and the aforementioned horrific Feathering disease, who must navigate the uncertainties of her mysterious past. </p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers features day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA Reflex. According to NVIDIA, at 4K resolution and max settings, DLSS can boost performance by an average of 5.9X on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, which can enable all of those technologies. More specifically, the RTX 5090 averages 312 frames per second, the RTX 5080 211 FPS, and the RTX 5070 Ti 185 FPS. Stay tuned on Wccftech to read our full review of this new Soulslike game.</p>

<p>On the same day, Tripwire Interactive is releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a>, the latest chapter in the cooperative zombie-killing shooter series. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game allows GeForce RTX owners to accelerate performance by activating NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, and DLSS Super Resolution. Those with high enough frame rates can ditch the latter for improved image quality with DLAA. Of course, NVIDIA Reflex is also available to improve responsiveness.</p>

<p>Another Unreal Engine 5 game, the free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter The First Descendant, is receiving an update on July 24 to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already supported</a> Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and several ray traced effects.</p>



<p>Today marks the debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-qa-were-definitely-thinking-about-joining-game-pass-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wildgate</a>, Moonshot Games and Dreamhaven's player-versus-player shooter game, which features built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution with the latest transformer model. Lastly, next week Riot Games will upgrade Valorant to Unreal Engine 5, retaining the existing support for NVIDIA Reflex.</p>
