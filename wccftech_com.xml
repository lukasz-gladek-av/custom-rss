			<p>2025 was <strong>an explosive year for shooter games</strong>. The schedule of the new year is also quite juicy, mostly thanks to <strong>Xbox Studios</strong> releasing two games based on its heavy-hitting shooter franchises in the same year: Halo Campaign Evolved and Gears of War E-Day. <span>Those two, plus Bungie's Marathon, are arguably the&nbsp;<strong>most anticipated shooter games of 2026</strong>&nbsp;based on what we currently know, but history has shown there can always be interesting surprises throughout the year.</span> Scroll down below to read our full shortlist and the honorable mentions, too.</p>

<h2 id="h-highguard-january-26-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Highguard (January 26, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS/XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Highguard-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Out of all the shooter games on this list, <strong>Highguard</strong> was the one <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced most recently</a>, and yet it is also going to be the first to hit the market. It was the final reveal at <strong>Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025</strong> event, and that didn't do it any favors, as many viewers complained the show should have ended on a higher note.</p>



<p>Still, that doesn't mean Highguard won't be fun. The game is being developed by a new studio called <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, a remote-first company founded by former developers who worked on <strong>Apex Legends</strong>, <strong>Titanfall</strong>, and <strong>Call of Duty</strong>. The game is a competitive 'raid shooter' where the player characters, called <strong>Wardens</strong>, who are arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Players will fight rival Warden crews for control of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure victory. The gameplay footage demonstrated fairly large maps where players will also ride mounts like horses, panthers, and bears. There's definitely a bit of a fantasy vibe, with several characters showcasing magic skills. Whether that will be enough to make it unique remains to be seen.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-march-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Marathon (March 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS/XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Marathon-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Bungie</strong>'s first new project since 2014's <strong>Destiny</strong> uses one of its historical franchises, <strong>Marathon</strong>. The upcoming installment launches thirty years after the previous entry, <strong>Marathon Infinity</strong>. This new game is fundamentally different, though: it's modeled after the increasingly popular <strong>extraction shooter</strong>. </p>



<p>Bungie plans to differentiate Marathon from existing extraction shooters by replacing generic characters with the so-called <strong>Runner Shells</strong>, bio-cybernetic hero archetypes like <strong>Stealth,</strong> <strong>Medic</strong>, and <strong>Destroyer</strong>, each possessing unique tactical abilities. The gameplay loop incorporates high-stakes, "raid-like" endgame scenarios on the <strong>UESC Marathon ship</strong>, where players must navigate security measures to claim high-tier artifacts.</p>



<p>The title emphasizes a persistent narrative through seasonal faction progression and <strong>The Codex</strong>, a system that tracks player achievements and non-linear story discoveries. There's also a dedicated <strong>Rook</strong> mode for solo players to scavenge in matches already in progress. Bungie also promised a player-friendly live-service model featuring <strong>non-expiring battle passes</strong> and a <strong>$39.99</strong> price point. </p>



<p>After several delays, we are now only around two months away from the game's launch. You can learn more about it <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our report based on the latest official ViDoc</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-tba-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Halo: Campaign Evolved (TBA 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS, XSX)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Halo_CampaignEvolved_Wallpaper-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>While Bungie, the original creator of the <strong>Halo </strong>series, readies its new Marathon game, the current caretakers of the Halo IP are remaking the game that made Bungie popular in the first place. Originally known as <strong>Halo: Combat Evolved</strong>, the 2001 release was the killer application of the first Xbox platform, as well as the first-person shooter that revolutionized the genre on consoles.</p>



<p>Following several rumors, <strong>Halo Studios</strong> (formerly known as <strong>343 Industries</strong>) has <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the existence of <strong>Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong>, a remake that focuses exclusively on the story mode, eliminating the multiplayer modes. Just like Oblivion Remastered, the game's visuals will run on Unreal Engine 5<span>, while the original engine (<strong>Blam</strong>) will</span> handle the rest. Several changes have been confirmed, including the addition of vehicle hijacking, weapon zooming, a redesigned 4-man Warthog, the optional addition of sprinting, and several level design changes that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original level designer didn't take kindly to</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Still, Halo: Campaign Evolved <strong>will introduce the series to PlayStation users for the first time</strong>. It could be a way to revive its popularity after several games in a row that received mixed reactions from the gaming community.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day-tba-2026-pc-xbox-series-s-and-x">Gears of War: E-Day (TBA 2026 - PC, Xbox Series S and X)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gears-of-war-e-day-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Apart from last year's <strong>Gears of War: Reloaded</strong>, fans of the third-person shooter franchise originally created by <strong>Epic Games</strong> haven't received a new mainline installment since <strong>2019's Gears 5</strong>. With <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, though, developer <strong>The Coalition</strong> (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborating with <strong>People Can Fly</strong></a>, a studio that previously worked on <strong>Gears of War Judgment</strong>, on this project) is ditching the semi-open world elements to tell a linear story once again.</p>



<p>Even so, the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasted</a> that this one will be <strong>their most ambitious game yet</strong>. E-Day, as the title itself confirms, is set <strong>fourteen years before the events seen in the first Gears of War</strong>, on the day that the <strong>Locust Horde</strong> emerged on the surface of the planet <strong>Sera</strong>. The story will feature the two young COG soldiers, <strong>Marcus Fenix</strong> and <strong>Dom Santiago</strong>, as they attempt to survive the invasion in the city of Kalona (a brand new location never before seen in previous games).</p>



<h2 id="h-witchfire-tba-2026-pc">Witchfire (TBA 2026 - PC)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WITCHFIRE_KEY_ART_17_Cut_withLogo_4K-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Polish indie developer <strong>The Astronauts</strong> is taking a very, very long time to make <strong>Witchfire</strong>. The studio's previous game, <strong>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter</strong>, was released in 2014, and their new project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-dark-fantasy-fps-astronauts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> over eight years ago at <strong>The Game Awards 2017</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, The Astronauts is a very small team, and Witchfire is a lot more ambitious than their previous adventure game. A dark fantasy shooter with <strong>roguelite</strong> elements, the game delayed its early access debut to <strong>September 2023</strong> to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-dark-fantasy-fps-is-delayed-to-2023-to-add-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world maps</a>. The game was initially available only on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> due to <strong>a timed exclusivity deal</strong> signed with Epic; the <strong>Steam</strong> early access version <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was launched exactly one year later</a>. Recently, the development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-surpasses-500k-units-sold-gets-reckoning-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a major update</a> called '<strong>The Reckoning</strong>' and confirmed that the game has surpassed <strong>500K units sold</strong>. However, as with most early access games, the vast majority of gamers are still waiting for the final version, slated to launch in 2026, to play.</p>

			<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong> is set to launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/"> January 30, 2026</a></strong>, but you can start playing it a week early when the Character Creator Demo launches on January 23, 2026. The news of the demo arrived alongside a new eight-minute gameplay walkthrough trailer and the release of several previews for the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">including one from Wccftech</a>. </p>



<p>The gameplay walkthrough trailer is a solid showcase of what to expect when Code Vein II <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/">arrives at the end of the month</a>. It goes through new elements of the combat, like the new dual blades, allowing for agile and deadly combos, or the tried-and-true halbred making its Code Vein debut. </p>



<p>It also shows off Sunken Pylon, a new area in Code Vein II that players will explore as they search for the key to purifying the Sunken City. The trailer also introduces another new combat mechanic for Code Vein II, Forma. These new special skills are broken down into three categories: weapons, defensive, and bequeathed, which consume a resource called Icor.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CODE VEIN II - Walkthrough Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/11mZY1UAqLo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll gain Icor when attacking enemies, and when you have enough, you can use one of your Forma skills to unleash fatal and devastating attacks. The trailer also shows how you can switch between summoning and assimilation. Summoning allows your partner to fight alongside you, while assimilation fuses them to you and boosts your own health and stats. </p>



<p>The whole video is a good breakdown of what to expect in Code Vein II, but if you want to hear more about the game, then you should <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/">check out Kai Tatsumoto's preview</a>, where they talked about several aspects of the game, including its combat, saying, "<em>Defensive tech works a bit differently in Code Vein II than what players might expect. It all comes down to the defensive forma that players equip and set to the L1 button. One allows for blocking, another allows for timed parries. They’re each situational, but with enemy attacks being well telegraphed, the parry forma should be the perfect fit for Soulslike veterans</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>On the other hand, combat skills and weapon forma are much like their counterparts from the first game. Players can set a palette of four different weapon skills between active attacks and passive temporary boosts, each with their own resource cost. Attacking and using a special drain attack both recharge this resource, allowing players to pull off vicious combos if they’ve accumulated enough stocked resources.</em>"</p>



<p>And of course, if you're keen to dive in, then be sure to download the demo when it arrives on January 23, 2026. The character you create can be transferred into the full game, meaning you can get a head start on your playthrough and start getting a feel for the game a week ahead of launch.</p>
