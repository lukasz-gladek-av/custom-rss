			<p>Today, Activision has confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remaster-supposedly-being-shadow-dropped-at-xbox-game-showcase-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier rumors</a> that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is indeed in development and will be released on July 11 on all leading gaming platforms, including PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. Truth be told, leakier extas1s said it would be shadow-dropped during Microsoft's Xbox Game Showcase in June, but July certainly isn't too far off that mark.</p>
<p>Anyway, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is coming, which is the most important thing for fans after the skater himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a false start a while ago when Vicarious Visions got merged with Blizzard. This time, the remake is being made by Iron Galaxy, the developer that was behind the PC port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> and also the studio picked by Naughty Dog to port both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II to the PC platform.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 includes everything in the original, plus new skaters and parks, extra tricks, and new tracks to crank up. Iron Galaxy says that the parks from both games have been authentically recreated with streamlined goals in a two-minute format. New parks include the so-called Waterpark with its grindable slides and a drained lazy river that's tailor-made for vert trick combos.</p>
<p>Through in-game challenges, players will earn in-game cash and access new gear, including new decks, grip tapes and wheels for their boards, and extra apparel for their skaters. Cross-platform online multiplayer supports up to eight skaters at a time. Iron Galaxy also added a New Game+ mode where players can retain the stats they had previously earned in their first playthrough.</p>
<p>Newcomers should have an easier way in thanks to an in-game tutorial led by Tony Hawk himself, featuring lessons on the all-important Ollie, kick flips, vert tricks, grinds, reverts, manuals, special tricks, and more. Last but not least, the original soundtrack has been expanded with new music.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 on all platforms except Nintendo Switch will provide access to the Foundry Demo due to launch in June, including two playable skaters, two parks, and a selection of songs. Players who pre-order the game will also gain instant access to the in-game Wireframe Tony Shader at launch.</p>
<p>As offered by pretty much all games nowadays, the Digital Deluxe Edition lets players in before the official July 11 launch date. That's on top of the following in-game bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Doom Slayer:&nbsp;</b>Play as Doom Slayer, featuring a Standard and Retro outfit plus two unique special tricks and the Unmaykr Hoverboard.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Revenant:</b>&nbsp;Get evil with the Revenant, including two unique special tricks.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Additional Music:</b>&nbsp;Headbang to a selection of classic and modern music tracks added to the in-game soundtrack.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Skate Decks:&nbsp;</b>Access additional skate decks including Doom Slayer and Revenant themed designs.</sub></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><sub><b>Create-A-Skater Items:&nbsp;</b>Kit out your skater with additional apparel items, including a baseball cap, two sweatshirts, and two t-shirts.</sub></li>
</ul>

			<p>Firaxis has launched the next update for Civilization VII, which has made some of the changes listed from the content roadmap that they released. Most of the content from the update are updates and suggestions that have been left by the community and the feedback provided. Below are some of the highlights of the update.</p>
<p>First is the new Natural Wonder that all players will be able to discover for free, which is the Bermuda Triangle. Cross-play between PC and consoles will also be re-enabled when this update releases. The update includes UI adjustments and addressing reported issues from the dedicated community.</p>
<p>For those that manage to make it to the Modern Age, there have now been some major changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory, as AI leaders have now been given a better opportunity at completing a Cultural Victory. This means that players can expect to see fewer Explorer Unit stacks scattered across the map.</p>
<p>Those going for a Religious Victory will now be able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. When players create their own Missionary Units, they will automatically follow the player's chosen Religion.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-disperse-an-independent-power-in-civilization-7/">Dispersing Independent Powers</a> is a large part of Civilization VII, and previously, land units were the only ones able to disperse them. Now, Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers, which can be incredibly helpful if you don't have units in that area.</p>
<p>Along with this update, it's announced that the first in-game event that was planned for Civilization VII will instead be postponed to a later update. This includes future events as well, with them all taking a backseat so that the developers can focus on prioritizing quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide.</p>
<p>After today's update, there will then be another major update taking place this month, with Update 1.1.1 of Civilization VII slated for March 25 (subject to change). This will add in the Quick Move functionality, as well as the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities and a new Natural Wonder, which is available to all players.</p>
<p>Looking even further into the future, the developers are planning on adding new map sizes for all platforms except Nintendo Switch, mod tools and Steam Workshop support, and further customizations that can be made to a player's game.</p>
<p>If you want the nitty-gritty of each change made in today's update to Civilization VII, or any future updates, you can find the information on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Civilization VII website</a>.</p>
