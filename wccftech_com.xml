			<p>Lossless Scaling's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/adaptive-frame-generation-is-lossless-scalings-latest-feature/">adaptive frame generation</a> is a great proof of concept that can deliver consistently smooth output with low base framerates even on mid-range system configurations.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a quick look at the new feature introduced to the upscaler earlier this month, highlighting how, even on a mid-range system powered by a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and an RTX 4060 GPU, the feature is capable of delivering consistently smooth 120 FPS output with low base framerates, high settings and even ray tracing at 1440p resolution in Control, and at native 4K resolution in Starfield. While the experience is far from perfect due to visual artifacts and the massive latency caused by the low base framerates, which is only partially alleviated by tech like NVIDIA Reflex, the new Lossless Scaling feature is an amazing proof of concept, also considering how it does not rely on any specific hardware technology.</p>

<p>Everything that Lossless Scaling offers is great for games that do not support upscalers from major vendors, but DLSS, FSR, and Intel XeSS will continue to be the better options for games with official support. AMD's upscaler, in particular, has made some impressive steps forward with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/">latest version</a>, delivering an image quality that is on par with the previous version of DLSS, which still retains the crown of the best upscaler currently available thanks to the introduction of the superior Transformer model which can deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-super-resolution-performance-better-dlss-3-8-quality/">impressive image quality with lower input resolution</a> than the previous CNN model.</p>

			<p>Control 2 has entered full production and is now Remedy's third game in full production, the company confirmed in a new update shared today.</p>
<p>In Remedy's <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/app/uploads/2025/03/remedy-annual-report-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual report</a>, the Finnish company confirmed that the full-blown sequel to the action-adventure game released back in 2020 is now in full production, besides<a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/"> FBC: Firebreak</a>, the co-op game set in the Control universe previously known as Project Condor, and the Max Payne 1&amp;2 remake, which entered full production <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/">last August</a>. Besides confirming the change of development state for the game, the new update doesn't provide any new information on the game, which will be powered by the studio's proprietary Northlight engine and will push the boundaries of action and storytelling, which Remedy has been successfully doing for years.</p>
<p>In proper Remedy fashion, Control 2 was teased in the Alan Wake 2 - The Lake House DLC expansion released last year. While it does a great job offering more of what the base offers, the expansion is a must-play only for die-hard fans of the base game and the Remedy Connected Universe, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With its great atmosphere and tight story pacing, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House retains the same elements that made the base game so engaging. The lack of significant new mechanics and its very short length, however, make it a worthwhile purchase only for the most die-hard fans of Alan Wake 2 and the Remedy Connected Universe.</em></p>
<p>Control 2 is now in development for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>
