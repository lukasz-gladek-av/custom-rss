			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 just got another major update recently, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">Patch 2.3 going live this past week</a>, and among the new features added was one that caught the eye of the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-cyberpunk-2077s-vrr-upgrade-sees-some-impressive-boosts-for-ps5-pro">Digital Foundry</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 now supports VRR on consoles, including PS5 Pro, and while CD Projekt RED has yet to put out an official PS5 Pro patch, the results of adding VRR support are about "<em>the closest we'll get</em>" according to DF.</p>



<p>The last time CD Projekt RED spoke on an official PS5 Pro update for Cyberpunk 2077, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-getting-a-ps5-pro-patch-anytime-soon/">claimed that there were "<em>no plans</em>"</a> to develop one, but then again, CD Projekt RED has also stated that it was done updating Cyberpunk 2077. Only to later release a new update for Cyberpunk 2077. So take that previous statement with a grain of salt for now, since it could just be that the studio is working up to it with updates like last week's adding VRR support.</p>



<p>As for what VRR support does for PS5 Pro owners today, Digital Foundry's testing found that unlocking the framerate can get players on PS5 Pro playing the game at 80 FPS+ on the Performance graphics mode. As Digital Foundry's John Linneman put it in today's DF Direct Weekly video, "<em>It's significantly better overall..averaging around 80 to 90 FPS, you can feel that. That is a significant upgrade.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Base-PS5 players have much less to be excited about, since DF found that playing with the new VRR modes on a base PS5 still has you hovering around 60 FPS, which is where the regular performance mode already stood. The same goes for the quality mode, which keeps players at the same previous marker of 30 FPS. PS5 Pro players get their framerate bumped up to 40 FPS when playing on the quality mode with ray tracing on.</p>



<p>Digital Foundry points out that there's still room for CD Projekt RED to improve Cyberpunk's performance on the PS5 Pro in both the performance and quality modes, such as improvements to ray-tracing, and to the framerate for other areas of Cyberpunk that, even with VRR on, still barely manage to hit 60 FPS on a PS5 Pro. </p>



<p>Still, if you shelled out the cash for a PS5 Pro, seeing a 20 FPS bump compared to the base PS5 on games like Cyberpunk 2077 is realistically the kind of improvement you paid for. It's good to see PS5 Pro players reaping the benefits of their upgrade, and hopefully, CD Projekt RED will one day release a proper, official PS5 Pro patch that improves elements of performance and graphical fidelity in the game across the board.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-third-person-new-game-plus/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-is-getting-third-person-view-and-new-game-on-its-3rd-anniversary.1248924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Ubisoft Massive announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> will receive a major update on December 5, its third anniversary. The date has also been chosen because it is exactly two weeks before the theatrical release of Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third movie in the franchise. </p>



<p>The update's main highlight is the addition of a full-fledged third-person camera. As you might recall, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was first-person only, which certainly turned at least a few gamers away for various reasons (motion sickness being one of the most obvious). </p>



<p>With third-person mode, players will be able to experience Pandora from a whole new perspective at the push of a button. Whether they're exploring, fighting, or simply taking in the view, the third-person mode brings a new sense of scale, freedom, and immersion. Ubisoft Massive reworked the animations, controls, audio, and camera systems to make the experience seamless and intuitive.</p>



<p>The upcoming update will also add another highly requested feature, New Game+, which allows players to replay the story while keeping their inventory and skills. They will face tougher enemies and unlock a brand-new skill tree and more powerful gear. It's a fresh challenge for seasoned players looking to delve deeper into the world of Pandora.</p>

<p>Omar Bouali, Creative Director at Massive, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’ve always envisioned Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora as a living world that evolves with our players. This update is a celebration of our community’s passion and we’re thankful to our players for their support—it means the world to our team.</em></p>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is also having a limited-time sale on various platforms. For example, on Steam, you can get any version of the game at 70% off through July 31. The Gold and Ultimate Edition provide access to the two story DLC packs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sky Breaker</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secrets of the Spires</a>.</p>

			<p>Developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots have shadowdropped Descenders Next on Steam in Early Access, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and it's available through Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Announced in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/4362384060822219438?l=english">August 2024</a>, Descenders Next is RageSquid's follow-up to Descenders, which launched in early access a little more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/most-anticipated-sports-racing-2019/">seven years ago</a>, and reached more than 35 million players across consoles and PC. Descenders Next moves the series beyond extreme mountainbiking, with snowboarding and mountainboarding as the next frontier for players to conquer. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>RageSquid boasts that Descenders Next "<em>already features as much content as the original Descenders, with full online multiplayer action, tons of tricks and grinds to pull off, and multiple huge biomes to explore."</em> If you're not playing it on Xbox Game Pass, then you can grab Descenders Next for $29.99 / £24.99 / 28.99 euros on Steam and Xbox. </p>

<p>The studio also says that the game will feature "<em>a more natural experience</em>," with procedurally-generated "<em>off-piste</em>" mountains that will be tied together by parks made by the development team, rather than having procedurally generated tracks or hand-crafted ones, as was the case in Descenders.</p>



<p>RageSquid is also determined to make Descenders Next the last word in extreme sports games, "<em>slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time."</em> What those sports will be and when they'll be added remains to be seen.</p>



<p>No More Robots and RageSquid did not provide an update as to when Descenders Next will arrive on PlayStation or Nintendo consoles, though <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/descenders-next-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc">when it was announced last August</a>, the studio did say that it was "<em>likely</em>" to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2, and that it would be coming to PlayStation "<em>at a later date</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-of-the-colossus-director-fumito-ueda-is-convinced-%E2%80%9Cthe-age-of-game-mechanics-is-over%E2%80%9D.1248855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game mechanics are the things players are usually talking about when they talk about the gameplay in a video game. Finding fluidity to the mechanics, even introducing new ones, can make a game stand out among the hundreds of games released each year. However, for iconic game director Fumito Ueda, the director behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-still-on-the-way-though-financing-isnt-secured-yet/">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, Ico, and The Last Guardian, game mechanics, or new ones, at least, are part of a bygone era of video games.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-age-of-game-mechanics-is-over-claims-shadow-of-the-colossus-director-ueda/">VGC</a>, in an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a">DefamicoGamer</a>, Ueda made the comment while talking about Katamari creator Keita Takahashi's latest game, To a T. "<em>I don’t remember exactly why I replied with a ‘like’ at the time, but I was probably thinking, ‘the era of game mechanics is over. I wonder if we are no longer in the era where we need to provide new devices or new game mechanics every single game."</em> Per VGC, Takahashi claims that Ueda has been spreading this particular gospel for years, specifically since Thatgamecompany's Journey released in 2012.</p>



<p>Ueda added, "<em>Even if the mechanics are not new, you can focus on the feel and art. Whether you like it or not, it’s better to sharpen the existing mechanics."</em> </p>



<p>What qualifies as a 'new' game mechanic is ultimately going to be subjective for players and game developers, but it's difficult not to see Ueda's point when you consider how difficult it can be to introduce something truly new to modern players. Art style, game feel, game narrative, and how fluidly all those elements are woven together are what can make games feel new, even if nothing about the individual parts is new. </p>



<p>Lies of P, for example, is a game that borrows plenty from other games. Customizing weapons isn't a new game mechanic, but how its weapon customization weaves into the rest of the game, in terms of its art, combat, and narrative, all help make the way Lies of P does weapon customization feel new for players.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most significant element of this insight into Ueda's view of modern video games and game making is the fact that we know he's working on a new project. Announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/">The Game Awards</a> last year with an intriguing trailer, this unnamed project already felt like a callback to Shadow of the Colossus, and it'll be interesting to see where else those similarities lie, and how Ueda chooses to sharpen game mechanics in his next game.</p>
