			<p>For those who love a gacha game or like the idea of collecting outfits and customizing your character to look how you want them to, then Infinity Nikki is certainly a great game for that. Infinity Nikki has been taking the world by storm since its release, and version 1.2 is set to release very soon. This is the second major update for Infinity Nikki, the hit title by Infold Games. To celebrate the upcoming launch of the update, <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infold Games</a> has officially released a trailer to showcase the magic of Firework Season.</p>
<p>Version 1.2 will be available in Infinity Nikki on PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android on January 24, where you can step into the New Bloom Festival and travel to a brand-new location called the Firework Isles, which is a collection of islands with panoramic views, serene areas to take pictures in, a natural cave and Camp Kaboom. If you want to see what you can get up to in Infinity Nikki's upcoming update, make sure to check out the brand-new trailer below for glimpses into the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki Version 1.2 [Firework Season] Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VZjad44Bpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to these new locations, Nikki and Momo will be able to undertake a new storyline called Glowing Fireworks, which will take you to the Firework Isles to prepare for the Carnival of Fireworks. Of course, it doesn't all go to plan and there will be trouble along the way for Nikki and Momo to resolve together.</p>
<p>With this new update comes new outfits, with both free and paid options, as well as new mini-games to participate in and new activities to get stuck into. The main feature of this new Infinity Nikki update is the New Bloom Festival, which sees the Linlang Empire's traditions come to Florawish, where players will get to have fun with music, lanterns, and firecrackers for the festive season. This whole season will run from January 23 to February 25.</p>
<p>As a reward for participating in the season's events, players will be able to get their hands on rewards such as 20 free pulls, 3,500 diamonds, and two exclusive outfits. There will also be nine free outfits to get from the Heartfelt Gifts Store.</p>
<p>For a game that was released at the end of 2024, it has already done incredibly well, with the game being downloaded well over 20 million times and receiving critical acclaim across the globe. <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikkis-shooting-star-season-update-releases-december-30/">Continuous updates</a> are being released to make the game a smoother, more accessible experience.</p>
<p>Will you be playing the upcoming update for Infinity Nikki?</p>

			<p>A lot seems to be riding on Grand Theft Auto 6, as the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games is considered to be among the growth engines for the entire game industry this year.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive State of Video Gaming in 2025 presentation</a> by CEO of Epyllion Matthew Ball, the new entry in the Rockstar Games series is among the potential growth engines for the industry this year together with the Nintendo Switch 2, other handhelds, non-core markets and more, which could help pull the industry from the cycle it has been in for a while. Specifically speaking about Grand Theft Auto 6, it is highlighted in the presentation how the game's release this year will have a mixed impact on the industry due to how the game will only be released on consoles and will severely cannibalize hours and spend in other titles, but some publishers hope the game's pricing will break the $70 barrier, and re-establish packaged game pricing after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about the potential impact Grand Theft Auto 6 will likely have on the entire video game industry. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/">Last month</a>, we learned that some publishers have yet to commit to Fall 2025 release dates for their games to be sure to launch their games as far away as possible from Rockstar Games' open-world game. Unfortunately, all of this planning could be for naught, as there's still the concrete possibility the game will be delayed to 2026, which wouldn't be very surprising, considering we have seen nothing of the game since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/">first trailer</a> released in late 2023.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2 Console Players Will Get Option to Disable Cross-Play in Season 2 Ranked Play]]></title>

			<p>Season 2 will begin next week for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone 2 with some <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big tweaks and new features</a>. For example, console users will get the long-requested option to disable cross-play functionality in Ranked Play. To clarify, this will only disable matchmaking against PC users, who may have unfair advantages due to their hardware configuration; players will still be matchmade against players from another console.</p>
<p>Ranked Play mode will also see the addition of a 'Vote to Forfeit' feature, allowing players to vote for their team to forfeit a match if they're about to be eliminated or have lost a teammate. Forfeited matches will count as a standard loss and won't result in SR penalties or suspensions. Later in Season 2, players will also be able to rejoin a Ranked Play match if they suffered from a temporary connection issue. The developers believe this should help maintain fuller matches.</p>
<p>For Season 2, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Zombies is getting a new map called Into The Tomb. Further quality-of-life updates coming later to this mode include the ability for the host to pause the game (only if everyone is in the same party) and restoring a player's loadout, Essence, and Salvage when they rejoin a match they were kicked from due to going AFK.</p>
<p>There will be a slew of gameplay improvements coming to all modes, like reduced collisions with teammates for improved maneuverability, bullet penetration updates, a weapon balance pass, reduced weapon movement when jumping, sliding, and diving with the Dexterity perk equipped, and improved player visibility in Kill Confirmed by reducing the height of dog tags. Later in Season 2, players with the War Cry perk active will be tagged with an icon over their heads so others know they are receiving faster health regeneration.</p>
<p>When it comes to Call of Duty Warzone 2, the new Season is set to bring several gameplay tweaks, such as faster reload speeds, reduced penalty when sprint-to-fire jumping, increased weapon swap speed, increased jump speed and successive jump height with one unmodified successive jump. Parachuting will also get quicker thanks to a faster parachute cut animation and increased player velocity when landing from a cut parachute.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Treyarch continues the fight against cheaters with improved client and server-side detections and systems, a major kernel-level driver update, driver security enhancement, an enhanced encryption process, and a brand-new tamper detection system.</p>
