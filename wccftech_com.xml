			<p>It seems like the Battlefield 6 reveal event may be very close, at last. Content creator Doom49 reported (as screengrabbed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-reveal-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Insider Gaming</a>) having received a promotional package this week, and rivaLxfactor <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946400245388038395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> a few more details:</p>



<p><em>I have confirmed with another person that there is a 3 day event at the end of July for EA which will include the live reveal of Battlefield 6. It will be much like the BF1 event, with players getting a live round in after the devs speak and video is showcased.</em></p>



<p>This is, perhaps, why EA Games won't be at Gamescom 2025, as their PR agency confirmed to Wccftech. They're going to have their own event, possibly on Tuesday, July 29, and, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/datamine-leak-ea-battlefield-6-open-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by a datamined leak</a>, there might be a public open beta not too long afterward.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has been in development for several years, with four studios contributing to the project:</p>



<ul>
<li>Franchise creator and caretaker DICE</li>



<li>Motive Studios (Star Wars: Squadrons, Dead Space Remake), which is working on the single player campaign</li>



<li>Criterion Games, which is working on both single player and multiplayer</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-dev-dice-la-rebrands-ripple-effect-studios-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple Effect Studios</a>, which worked on Battlefield 2042's Community Portal</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to a report</a> from early July, Electronic Arts has lofty goals for Battlefield 6: it seeks to reach a hundred million players, which would be by far the franchise record. The report also hinted at a $400 million budget, one of the largest in the history of gaming, and various development troubles. </p>



<p>One thing is for sure: Battlefield 6 cannot fail like 2042 and, to a lesser extent, Battlefield V did. To that end, EA should ensure that the game is polished enough before making it to launch. Officially, we only know that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released before the end of EA's fiscal year</a>, which is to say before the end of April 2026.</p>
