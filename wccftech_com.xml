			<p>The Epic Games Store is continuing its annual tradition of giving away one game each day over the holiday period, and on the night before Christmas, it's Striking Distance Studio's maligned spiritual successor to Dead Space: <strong>The Callisto Protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>Epic kicked off this year's barrage of free games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/">with Hogwarts Legacy</a> the night of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025,</a> which was free from the night of the show, December 11, until December 18. Following that, on December 18, Epic began giving away one free game a day. So far, the store has given away:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Dec. 11-18)</li>



<li>Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel (Dec. 18)</li>



<li>Eternights (Dec. 19)</li>



<li>Blood West (Dec. 20)</li>



<li>Sorry We're Closed (Dec. 21)</li>



<li>Paradise Killer (Dec. 22) </li>



<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Dec. 23)</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol (Dec. 24)</li>
</ul>



<p>The Callisto Protocol is arguably the biggest game to be given away since Hogwarts Legacy kicked things off, though, as a Christmas Eve giveaway, it is a tad disappointing considering it has previously been a free giveaway game on the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>Tomorrow's giveaway for Christmas Day, and the final game that will be given away on January 1, 2026, are usually the bigger titles compared to everything else, with previous years gifting players games like Death Stranding Director's Cut.</p>



<p>If you've never played The Callisto Protocol, then you can't really go wrong with picking it up for free. Yes, it did so poorly that <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-the-callisto-protocol-directed-his-last-game/">it may go down as Glen Schofield's final game</a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocols-metacritic-score-caused-publisher-kraftons-stock-to-go-down/">Metacritic score may have been the cause for Krafton's stock to take a dip</a>, and yes, even <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">Schofield admitted that it was pushed out the door too early</a>.</p>



<p>But for all its faults and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">resulting consequences</a>, if you're a fan of horror games, then it's worth your time to give The Callisto Protocol a try. It definitely doesn't reach the heights of Dead Space, but it's focus on melee combat over ranged cranks up the tension, and if you have the hardware for it (<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-the-callisto-protocol-patch-5-03-addresses-pc-ray-tracing-crashes-and-further-improves-performance/">now that its biggest issues have been patched out</a>), it is a stunning visual treat of a game.</p>



<p>As Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">highlighted in his review back in 2022</a>, "<em>One area that The Callisto Protocol absolutely excels in, however, is in the overall presentation and graphical design. There's nary a single square inch of Callisto and Black Iron Prison that doesn't capture that derelict, abandoned spaceship vibes, complete with ambient sounds of creaking pipes or rustling footsteps in the far distance.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While 2025 didn't have some of the standout DLC/expansion releases that 2024 did with Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, that's not to say 2025 presented little to no reason to return to older titles.</p>



<p>There were several expansions and DLC releases this year that offered compelling returns to already great games, and Wccftech has selected five of this year's releases as our Best DLC/Expansions of 2025</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Fighting Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-sports-and-racing-games-2025/">Sports &amp; Racing Games,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Role-Playing Games</a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2025-a-year-of-frights/">Horror Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/">Platformers</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Indie Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Action</a></em></p>



<h2 id="h-lies-of-p-overture-8-10">Lies of P: Overture (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lies-of-p-overture-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Lies of P: Overture. Image credit: Neowiz</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's no Shadow of the Erdtree, but Lies of P: Overture is easily one of 2025's best DLC/expansions of the year. Neowiz and Round8 Studio return to their Bloodborne-like Pinnochio game with a prequel that sets up the events of the main game and takes the series protagonist to a snow-covered Krat.</p>



<p>It doesn't try to change or fix what wasn't broken about Lies of P, adding to the main game without taking anything away from the experience of playing through it. It steps up the difficulty in a big way, and adds to the already inventive lineup of weapons that players have available to them in the base game, and presents some impressive boss fights.</p>



<p>As Francesco De Meo wrote in his review, "<em>While it doesn't add anything substantially new to the experience, Lies of P: Overture expansion is a more than worthy expansion, delivering an engaging story delving deeper into the base game's lore, featuring some of the best bosses in the entire game, and adding new weapons that can significantly shake up combat. Its lack of innovation and unfair difficulty may turn off a few players, but all those who loved every second of the base game will have no trouble falling in love again with one of the best Soulslikes of the past few years</em>."</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mysteria-ecclesiae">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Mysteria Ecclesiae</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/KCD2-DLC3-16x9_Unbranded.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Mysteria Ecclesiae. Image credit: Warhorse Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is a bit of a mixed entry, since we're including the other Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 DLCs in one entry, though we're also specifically highlighting the third and final DLC, Mysteria Ecclesiae. All three DLCs are worth your time and worth checking out, especially considering the fact that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is already one of the year's best games.</p>



<p>It was already an impressive game for Warhorse Studios to deliver at the top of the year, and even more impressive for the team to deliver three DLC expansions before the game had even hit its one-year anniversary. Mysteria Ecclesiae is a stunning culmination of the three DLCs, with a fun detective story that takes its foot off the gas in terms of combat and challenges players to use their investigative skills.</p>



<p>Legacy of the Forge and Brushes with Death are both fine DLC releases as well, but Mysteria Ecclesiae is the one that stands above the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star Crossed World</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Star-Crossed-World.png"></a><figcaption><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/">was a remarkable outing for Kirby back in 2022</a>, so it was exciting to learn that we'd get to return to the game this year with more than just a graphical update to look forward to as part of the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>Star-Crossed World has players revisit stages from the base game, but it's not just a walk down memory lane. Newly introduced 'Starryflowers' open up entirely new versions of levels and add a sense of excitement to revisiting every level for all of the remixed 'Starry Stages.'</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-hands-on/">wrote in their impressions of Star-Crossed World</a>, "<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World is the first Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade I can fully, unequivocally recommend. The game's technical update wows and the new Star-Crossed World content is inventive, fun, and easily worth the $20 premium on its own. Between this Switch 2 update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, fans of Nintendo's pink puffball are eating hearty this year.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-SMPJ-NS2EditionJamboreeTV.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another addition to the list that comes from the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 prompting Nintendo to go through the lineup of Switch games and make additions, Super Mario Party Jamoboree + Jamboree TV adds a little more to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/">was already a fairly solid entry in the Mario Party franchise</a>.</p>



<p>Minigames like the new Carnival Coaster mode are standouts across the entire game, and it's a solid showcase of the new features that come with a Nintendo Switch 2, like the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls. That said, other minigames that try to take advantage of other new Switch 2 features, like the camera and the mic, are less successful, but still have their charm.</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-hands-on/">wrote in his impressions of Jamboree TV</a>, "<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is an interesting showcase of Nintendo’s latest hardware features, for better or worse. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera feels like a late-to-the-party retread of a style of gameplay that went out of fashion a decade ago, but pretty much any mode and minigame that relies on Joy-Con 2 mouse controls works out quite well. Nintendo’s asking price may be hard to justify for some, but if you’re looking for a single product that shows off all of the Switch 2’s unique abilities, this multi-talented upgrade may be worth an invite.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker">Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sea-of-Stars-Throes-of-the-Watchmaker.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker. Image credit: Sabotage Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes, an expansion is a chance for developers to change or tweak things from the base game that perhaps didn't gel with players the first time. That's not necessarily the case with Throes of the Watchmaker, the free DLC for 2023's Sea of Stars. If you weren't already into Sea of Stars, it's not likely that this DLC will turn you into a fan of the game.</p>



<p>But there's really nothing wrong with that, as Throes of the Watchmaker leans into the best elements of Sea of Stars and adds a little more nuance to the characters and to the game's combat system. It's also another stunning display of the pixel art Sabotage Studios is capable of, and on top of all of that, it feels necessary to mention once again that this expansion is free for all players.</p>



<p>It's an easy pick as one of 2025's best DLCs, and if you already loved Sea of Stars, Throes of the Watchmaker is an absolute must-play.</p>

	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>So far, in the renaissance of film and TV adaptations of video games, on the film side, the clear winners have been the Sonic film franchise and the Super Mario Bros movie, with the latter <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/">grossing over $1.3 billion at the box office</a>. On the TV side, the standouts have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-breaks-hbo-records/">HBO's The Last of Us </a>and <strong>Amazon's Fallout</strong> series, and the momentum started by Season 1 of Fallout is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">already being carried forward with Season 2</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, it seems that Amazon is so enamoured with the success it has seen from its Fallout series that not only is Fallout <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/">getting a Season 3</a>, but a new report from film and TV insider <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/fallout-reality-competition-series-amazon-prime-video-jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy-apply-2026-production?utm_source=www.theinsneider.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=exclusive-amazon-s-fallout-franchise-expanding-with-reality-competition-series-from-jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy&amp;_bhlid=f33fad6d96aa0bf16984bec469b07f4defb8438a">Jeff Sneider</a> (spotted by <a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/new-fallout-show-in-the-works-but-its-not-based-on-the-game-youre-expecting/">ComicBook</a>) claims that Amazon is working on a totally new Fallout TV show based on a different game in the franchise: <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right. The hit mobile and tabletop game that <a href="http://wccftech.com/fallout-shelter-now-available-pc-gets-update-1-6-biggest-one-yet/">eventually made its way to consoles and PC</a> is apparently the foundation for the next adaptation of Fallout, and it's not going to be another fictional story with new characters in Bethesda's nuclear dystopian future. It's going to be a reality competition show, according to the report, with competitors vying to keep vault dwellers alive and provide them with the necessary resources like food, water, and keeping their vault shelter safe.</p>



<p>The report adds that we could see the show take place across multiple Vaults, or potentially just one large one. It's unclear at the moment, though hopefully, as we get into 2026 and once the current season of Amazon's already-running Fallout series has concluded, we'll hear more about this Fallout Shelter spin-off.</p>



<p>While it'll be some time before we know for sure if this reality competition adaptation is in the works, we do know that Bethesda has already been weaving in references to the TV show Amazon already has running in the mobile game.</p>



<p>Alongside the premiere of season 2, Bethesda introduced a Viva New Vegas Season in Fallout Shelter, which features limited-time vaults separate from your main vaults and features three main characters from the TV show: Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fallout-Shelter-Viva-New-Vegas.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's clear that Bethesda is doing whatever it can to create connections between every game in the Fallout franchise and the hit TV show on Amazon. There's even <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/">a new season of Fallout 76 inspired by the show</a>. It doesn't confirm anything, or even lean towards Sneider's claim being correct, but these connections do at least suggest that Bethesda wants to do everything it can to take advantage of the show's success.</p>



<p>A reality competition show, based on one of the more obscure games in the Fallout lineup, is definitely one way of trying to do that.</p>



<p>After all, it'll be years before we even see any hint of Fallout 5, with The Elder Scrolls VI on deck to be Bethesda's next major game. It'll be a lot easier for Bethesda to have a successful return for the series if it can keep it top of mind for players while we all wait for a new mainline game. They can only <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/">re-release Fallout 4 so many times before people stop caring</a>, after all. </p>

			<p>Ever since horror became a video game genre, it has always enjoyed great popularity. Whether focused on action, puzzle solving, or atmosphere, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">every year so far has seen the release of some excellent titles, </strong></a>and<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> 2025 was no different.</strong></a> Over the past 12 months, not only has the very first new mainline entry of a beloved survival horror series been launched, but also new IPs that have provided an interesting take on a genre that shows no sign of losing popularity.</p>



<p>Here are our five best horror games released this year, as well as other games that, while not the absolute best, deserve to be mentioned in a year packed with all sorts of frights.</p>

<h2 id="h-silent-hill-f-9">Silent Hill f (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">9</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Silent-Hill-f-Key-Art.webp"></a><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f marks the return of the KONAMI series with a high-quality game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Following the grand return of Silent Hill with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">remake of the second entry in the franchise developed by Bloober Team</a></strong>, fans of the KONAMI series were highly anticipating the launch of the proper first new mainline entry in the series in years, Silent Hill f. Expectations were high, but they were fully met with one of the most haunting experiences the series offered to date.</p>



<p>Silent Hill f may not be set in the series' titular town, but Ebisugaoka is every bit as haunting. Running away from a complicated family situation, Hinako embarks in a deep journey into her psyche, eventually coming to terms with her own frustrations in the most horrific ways. With a real-world mystery deeply rooted in the series' universe, which gets revealed over multiple playthroughs, engaging puzzles, and an action-oriented combat system that's surprisingly engaging, the series couldn't have made its proper comeback in a better way.</p>



<p><em>"With a gripping and often disturbing story, a setting unlike anything seen before in the franchise, and gameplay that blends new ideas with a familiar framework, Silent Hill f shows that the series is not only back, but stronger than ever. While performance issues and a short runtime do impact the experience, they in no way diminish what is a triumphant return for one of the most important survival horror series ever,"</em> I wrote in my review, praising what can be easily considered the best horror game of the year.</p>

<p>Rogue Factor's Hell is Us has looked like a very interesting game ever since its reveal, with its combination of haunting atmosphere, intricate puzzles and gameplay mechanics lifted from soulslike games. And while the execution of some of these elements isn't the best, the game still delivers one of the best overall gaming experiences of the year.</p>



<p>Although the game's action elements have little to do with the horror genre, the setting, story, and, most of all, the complete lack of guidance (including quest markers) create a tension to Remi's journey that is more akin to horror games than <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/"><strong>action games</strong></a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"><strong>RPGs</strong></a>, resulting in an experience with a much broader appeal.</p>



<p>Hell is Us' qualities were highlighted in David Carcasole's review, who wrote: <em>"Hell is Us is an amazing accomplishment, and will easily remain one of 2025's best games, though it falls short of amazing, and reaching the status of some of its influences. With a rich atmosphere, stunning visuals, deep lore, wonderfully realized characters and a fairly solid combat experience, it's not a game to be missed."</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Cronos-the-New-Dawn-Key-Art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Although not very original, Cronos: The New Dawn is among Bloober Team's best games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although belonging to a brand-new IP, many horror game fans were eagerly anticipating the release of Cronos: The New Dawn. Being the first game Bloober Team was launching after the successful Silent Hill 2 remake, many were wondering if the studio would be able to release a second game with the same level of quality.</p>



<p>The answer is a resounding yes. While the Traveler's journey in a twisted reimagining of Krakow's Nowa Huta district feels like a tribute to the Dead Space series, Cronos: The New Dawn has a lot of interesting things going on for itself, including a gripping, mystery-filled story with a surprisingly personal touch, and some clever combat ideas that make the game quite engaging.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">With its by-the-books survival horror experience, its first few hours feeling more frustrating than fun due to clunky combat and average enemy design, Cronos: The Dawn seemed to be nothing more than an unremarkable survival horror heavily inspired by the Dead Space series. Push past the around two hours mark, however, and the game blossoms into one of Bloober Team's best titles to date, thanks to its quirky mechanics, solid level design, unique setting and mystery-filled story</em>," I wrote in my review, glad that I was able to power through those frustrating first hours to experience one of the finest horror games of the year.</p>



<h2 id="h-routine-8-5">ROUTINE (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/routine-review-lunar-software-raw-fury/">8.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE-key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE's constanst gripping tension is one of the highlights of the experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The road to release for ROUTINE was long, but the final product is a haunting reminder that some things are more than worth the wait.</p>



<p>The first-person horror developed by Lunar Software sports a distinct 80s retro-futuristic aesthetic which creates a world that feels both familiar and terrifyingly alien. While the narrative doesn't always manage to shine through the oppression of its abandoned lunar base, the game succeeds where it matters most: pure, unrelenting tension.</p>



<p>This constant tension is one of the reasons why ROUTINE stays gripping for its 10-hour duration. That, and its marked Alien: Isolation feel, as highlighted by David Carcasole in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"ROUTINE is an excellent puzzle-focused first-person horror game that, despite its slow pacing, is able to keep you at the edge of your seat for 10 hours straight, with a tense, rich atmosphere created by wonderful execution of its retro futuristic aesthetic and stunning soundscape that immerses you in its world and gets you listening for the sound of a pin drop to avoid getting caught. Its narrative may be unable to shine through, but at the end of the day it is altogether an interesting game, a game worth playing again, and the game that Alien: Isolation fans should play while we all wait for Alien: Isolation 2."</em></p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-6-5">Dying Light: The Beast (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">6.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dying-Light-The-Beast-key-art.png"></a><figcaption><em>The series's engaging gameplay props Dying Light: The Beast up, even with its disappointing narrative</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Expanding to a full game during development from a DLC for the second entry in the series, Dying Light: The Beast is not just a standalone adventure. It’s a homecoming. After a decade-long absence, legendary protagonist Kyle Crane returns, demonstrating how the series' tight gameplay can make a game engaging despite an uneven narrative.</p>



<p>Set in the atmospheric, Swiss-inspired valley of Castor Woods, the game successfully recaptures the genuine dread of the original game's night cycles, while balancing it with Kyle Crane's transformation and a revenge tale that, sadly, leaves something to be desired in terms of tone and pacing.</p>



<p>Even so, Dying Light: The Beast is a game worthy experiencing for its gameplay, which is as exhilarating as in previous entries in the series, as highlighted by David Carcasole in his review:<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> "Dying Light: The Beast's parkour mechanics and crunchy melee combat are the two load-bearing pillars that make it a game worth leaping into, with support from a beautiful world to explore (minus the infected) and a tense day and night cycle that greatly raises the stakes on its survival elements.</em><em>"</em></p>
