			<p>A pre-development video for the new Virtua Fighter project in the works by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio was shared during CES 2025, providing a quick look at the sort of visuals the game should be expected to push.</p>
<p>The video, which was shown during <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote</a>, is essentially a proof-of-concept video showcasing two versions of the series' protagonist, Akira, duking it out in a highly detailed town environment with an Asian flair. Still, it is undeniable that the direction the celebrated fighting game series by SEGA is taking is looking quite promising in the visuals and animation department.</p>
<p><iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Virtua Fighter project was announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">last month</a> during The Game Awards show, along with another project called Project Century, which looks more in line with the Like a Dragon series. Sadly, very little is currently known about these projects, and it may be a while before we hear more about them, considering they both lack official names.</p>
<p>Despite the new Virtua Fighter project likely being far from release, fans of the series still have something to look forward to. Later this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-brings-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-to-steam-this-winter/">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O</a> is launching on PC, taking the gameplay of the fifth entry in the series, which is also available on PlayStation 5 as Ultimate Showdown, and bringing it to new heights with rollback netcode support, 4K visuals and additional content.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-leaked-photo-shows-new-information-system-will-ship-with-a-60w-charger.1075851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-dock-60w-charger/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another day, another Nintendo Switch 2 leak. Today, a new partial picture of the system's dock started making the rounds online, providing new information on the yet-to-be-revealed consoles.</p>
<p>The new picture of the dock, which was shared online today by Laura Kate Dale, features visible input and output voltage information with other information having been oscured, likely to protect the identity of the trusted source that provided the picture. Additionally, the system will reportedly ship with a 60W charger for use with the dock. As a result, any charging cable compatible with the current system won't be usable for powering the Nintendo Switch 2 when docked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As a result, to my understanding, the current generation Switch mains charger cable won't be suitable for use powering the Switch 2 when docked.</p>
<p>— Laura Kate Dale - Bluesky @LauraKBuzz.bsky.social (@LaurakBuzz) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurakBuzz/status/1876581690946081024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At this point, the only thing regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 that has yet to be leaked are the games, as in the past few days, we have managed to get a sneak peek at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">system as a whole</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/">motherboard</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/">dock</a>, and even the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/">Joy-Con controllers</a>, which could also be used as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/">PC mouse</a>. The pictures of the motherboard, in particular, have been notable for having confirmed how the T239 chip that powers the system is being produced by Samsung. While the process node is still unknown, there's a high chance the chip is an 8nm SoC, mostly due to the trouble that would involve <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/">porting NVIDIA Ampere architecture to other process nodes</a> instead of using another architecture altogether.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but with almost daily leaks, there's no doubt that an official announcement isn't too far off. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>A Steam Deck 2 powered by the newly announced AMD Ryzen Z2 is not in the works, a Valve employee confirmed.</p>
<p>Following the rumors that started circulating online after the announcement of the next-gen AMD APUs for future iterations of portable gaming systems which suggested that a Steam Deck 2 was in the works, Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed on Bluesky that there is and there won't be a Z2 Steam Deck, specifying how the slide that accompanied the APUs' announcement was just meant to highlight how they were meant for portable gaming systems, and they were not announcing anything specific.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fujt6oiklsacwfkoqyzwiu2z/app.bsky.feed.post/3lf36y66ggs2b" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigjmkrybod6dx43kordi2sff6iwzfq4xhquu67fo2chk5i3vs7cdy">
<p lang="en">There is and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.</p>

<p>While we won't see a Steam Deck 2 powered by any of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APUs</a> announced during CES 2025, it won't take long to see what the next-generation chips can bring to the portable gaming space. The first APUs will make their debut in the first quarter of the year, which will also likely be when the first portable systems powered by them will appear on the market.</p>
<p>With no Steam Deck 2 on the horizon, the OLED model featuring a much better screen and some light improvements over the base model will continue to be the go-to system for those wishing to enter the portable gaming space with Valve hardware. More information on the original system released back in 2022 can be found in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A number of big NVIDIA ACE announcements were shared during the company's CES 2025 keynote. NVIDIA has expanded its ACE (Avatar Cloud Engine) technology, originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-unveils-ace-model-for-next-gen-games-integrating-ai-into-virtual-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Computex 2023, in various ways. The improved tech will provide AI-powered allies and foes in multiple big PC games.</p>
<p>KRAFTON, for example, has gone all-in on NVIDIA ACE. Its leading product, PUBG, will add 'co-playable characters' through the so-called PUBG Ally feature. Powered by the Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k-instruct small language model (SMM), PUBG Ally lets AI teammates communicate using game-specific lingo, provide strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and even fight other players.</p>
<p>KRAFTON CEO CH Kim said:</p>
<p><em>CES 2025 marks a significant milestone for KRAFTON and NVIDIA as we work together to unveil AI technology that will revolutionize the gaming industry. We plan to closely collaborate with NVIDIA to drive the transformation of the user experience with AI-powered innovation, such as CPC, that promises to redefine the future of gaming.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEKUSMqrbzQ?si=qI8HIZZ8b5iO51mj" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inZoi</a>, KRAFTON's upcoming life simulation game, is also using NVIDIA ACE with a spin of its own on the co-playable characters concept. The so-called 'Smart Zoi' will dynamically adapt to what's happening around them and react based on their personalities. For example, a Smart Zoi with a considerate personality could notice a hungry man on the street, go to the food store and grab him something to eat. In another instance, they might help a lost woman by giving them directions.</p>
<p>Kangwook Lee, Head of Deep Learning Division at KRAFTON, said:</p>
<p><em>PUBG IP Franchise's PUBG Ally and inZOI's Smart Zoi, rising as the world's first CPC (Co-Playable Character) built with NVIDIA ACE, are unlocking new and unique experiences. At KRAFTON, we’re excited by the possibilities of ACE autonomous game characters and how AI will enhance the way we create games.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA ACE | inZOI - Create Simulated Cities with Co-Playable Characters" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pk9z1upOj3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Other developers are also implementing similar NVIDIA ACE powered features in their games. For example, NetEase has announced that AI teammates will be added to its highly successful free-to-play Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint. These NPCs will join the player's party, battle alongside them, find specific items that they might need, swap gear, offer suggestions on which skills to unlock, and fight smartly to help the player win.</p>
<p>Zhipeng Hu, Head of Thunder Fire BU and SVP of NetEase, stated:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA enables game developers to push past expected boundaries with AI technology. NVIDIA ACE in NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION allows us to create AI autonomous characters that allows us to create AI autonomous teammates running on the device locally that naturally assist the player in their epic battles.</em></p>
<p>The feature is coming in March to the mobile version of NARAKA: Bladepoint playable on PC, while the native PC version is getting it later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA ACE | NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION - Introduces AI Powered Teammates" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I65tiaHQuFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the other hand, Korean developer Wemade is going to use it in its MIR5 MMORPG to power what they're calling the world's first AI boss, Asterion, Lord of the Void. MMORPG players know all too well that even the most complicated bosses are static and, therefore, predictable for humans. The goal here with NVIDIA ACE is to change all that forever.</p>
<p>The AI model enables Asterion to analyze the party, identify each player's unique skills, and determine who to attack first, such as the healer, traditionally the weakest character. Asterion also recalls past battles similar to the current situation and then determines the most probable course of action to achieve victory. The boss will also constantly adapt, attacking with unpredictable patterns so that it cannot be defeated twice with the same strategy.</p>
<p>Jung Soo Park, CEO of Wemade Next, said:</p>
<p><em>Together with NVIDIA, we have begun a new era of gaming with NVIDIA ACE autonomous game characters. MIR5’s AI bosses are a milestone moment in gaming, enabling unique boss encounters with every play session. We’re excited to see how this technology transforms games.</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | MIR5 - Wemade Introduces the First AI Boss" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8XeiZ4djKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA ACE is being utilized in many different ways by developers. For example, the upcoming murder mystery game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628740/Dead_Meat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Meat</a> will use it to power its fully dynamic conversations locally. The game previously used LLMs via cloud, but at CES 2025, they showed locally generated dialogue running on a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU.</p>
<p>Developer Meaning Machine integrated ACE and NVIDIA's Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-128K small language model (SLM), Eleven Labs' Text To Speech (TTS), and Open AI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) into its own Game Conscious AI system.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | Dead Meat - Bringing AI Characters On Device" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFwIVnDU8KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>GoodAI's sandbox game AI People features AI-driven NPCs that interact autonomously with each other, their environment, and the player, creating a dynamic AI-generated narrative. The developer says these NPCs learn, experience emotions, pursue their goals, dream, talk,&nbsp;and create a dynamic story for the player. Built using extensive language and speech recognition models, AI People can now run locally on a GeForce RTX GPU in addition to the previous cloud option.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z98IdBAM4NM?si=uE2ulIT2RcYOyvKR" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>TiGames, the developer behind the Metroidvania game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f-i-s-t-forged-in-the-shadow-torch-grease-stained-furtasy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch</a>, has showcased a tech demo called ZooPunk where the combination of several AI technologies lets NPCs communicate naturally with the player. A speech model listens to their voice and translates the words to text, while a language model parses the text to understand the intention behind the sentence and generate the NPC's response. The NPC's voice is also AI-powered, and NVIDIA ACE provides lip synchronization with Audio2Face. Perhaps more interestingly, the demo shows the first use of on-device in-game Stable Diffusion image generation, where the player can simply ask the NPC to repaint the airship with new art. The ZooPunk demo also ran on the new GeForce RTX GPUs, not on the cloud.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | ZooPunk - TiGames Partner Spotlight - New Dimensions for In-Game Customizations" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEZAYvHIAgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By the way, NVIDIA ACE's Audio2Face is also featured in the recently launched VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>. Moreover, Perfect World Games is using it for its Unreal Engine 5-powered MMORPG World of Jade Dynasty. Perfect World Games brought a showcase video at CES 2025 to demonstrate how Audio2Face allows them to animate their vast cast of characters in both Chinese and English.</p>
<p>The animations are dynamically adjusted based on various variables detected in the recorded voice acting. Of course, if any adjustments are needed, developers can intervene manually to make changes as they see fit, tailoring dialogue for specific scenes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant.1075794/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2, the next evolution of the innovative tech used today in over 100 games to reduce latency, promises to further reduce latency by up to 75%.</p>
<p>As announced during CES 2025, NVIDIA Reflex 2 will combine Reflex Low Latency mode with a new Frame Warp technology that will further reduce latency by updating the rendered game frame based on the latest mouse input before it is sent to the display. This new technology was developed based on a study conducted by NVIDIA's esports research team four years ago which illustrated how players could complete aiming tasks faster when frames are updated after being rendered based on the more recent mouse input. As such, shifting or warping an existing frame to show the result of the action sooner could bring some significant improvements in terms of latency.</p>
<p>This is exactly what NVIDIA Reflex 2's Frame Warp tech does. As a frame is being rendered by the GPU, the CPU calculates the camera position of the next frame in the pipeline based on the player's input. Frame Warp samples the new camera position from the CPU and warps the frame rendered by the GPU to the newer camera position, doing so at the very last moment to ensure the latest input is shown on screen. To prevent the small holes in the image created when the new camera position shows a new part of a scene, NVIDIA developed a latency-optimized predictive rendering algorithm that uses camera, color, and depth data from prior frames to fill these holes accurately, making players see the rendered frame with the updated camera position without any hole and with reduced latency for any action that caused the camera shift. All this will allow players to improve their aim and tracking of enemies.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA Reflex 2 | Introducing New Frame Warp Technology" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpDxo2m6Sko?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Together with the explanation above, NVIDIA also showcased NVIDIA Reflex 2 with its Frame Warp technology in Embark Studio's The Finals, which will be among the first games to support it. Without Reflex, on an RTX 5070 GPU at 4K, max settings, latency is 56ms, which is reduced to 27ms with Reflex 1 and to 14ms with Reflex 2.</p>

<p><iframe title="Reflex Frame Warp Inpainting Comparison | THE FINALS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9UcLnYyB6bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2 with its Frame Warp technology will also provide significant improvements in CPU-limited scenarios. In VALORANT, which will also support the technology soon, on an RTX 5090 that can run the game at over 800 FPS on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-gpu-custom-models-roundup/">RTX 5090</a>, latency is reduced to an average of under 3ms with Frame Warp, which is extremely impressive.</p>

<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2 will debut together with the GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs, with support for other RTX GPUs coming in the future. More information on the newly announced technology can be found on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-2-even-lower-latency-gameplay-with-frame-warp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's official website.</a></p>
