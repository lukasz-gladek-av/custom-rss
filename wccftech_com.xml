			<p><strong>Update 09/01/2026: </strong>In response to the publication of this article, a separate user on <a href="https://x.com/hajedan/status/2009669186285646307?s=46">X (formerly Twitter)</a> dug into the Smarty.cz source code to verify the Steam Machine pricing estimates for themselves, and went a step further to look into <strong>Alza</strong>, another Czech retailer and one of the country's largest.</p>



<p>On Alza's listing for the Steam Machine, user Hajedan also found that it had a similar pricing structure for the Steam Machine, though added that the original post's indication that the actual price will be lower than the conversion estimates is almost definitely correct due to Alza and Smarty.cz including their own markups.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Valve's reveal of its Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">was one of 2025's biggest announcements</a>, and while players are excited about the potential of the new GabeCube, one question has hovered above the new hardware like a dark cloud (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">that grows even darker with memory shortage complications</a>): <strong>how much will the Steam Machine cost?</strong></p>



<p>Well, we don't yet have official pricing, but a leak from a Czech retailer may have just provided our first indication as to what the latest gaming box will cost. Shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingnewsandleaks/comments/1q88b1u/grain_of_salt_steam_machine_price_leaked_1000_for/">Reddit's GamingLeaksandRumors page by user chusskaptaan</a>, a third-party Czech retailer known as <a href="https://www.smarty.cz/Valve-Steam-Machine-512GB-4p249960">Smarty.cz has a live listing for the Steam Machine</a>, featuring two different models.</p>



<p>The first is a <strong>512GB</strong> model, which, according to the website's source code, seems to cost <strong>19,826 CZK</strong>, or approximately <strong>$950 USD</strong>. The other model is a <strong>2TB</strong> version, and it seems to be listed at <strong></strong><strong>22,305 CZK</strong>, or <strong>$1,070 USD.</strong></p>



<p>It should be noted that these prices are estimates based on a conversion from Czech Koruna, and as the post itself notes, third-party retailers could have their own markups, which means the actual retail price of the machine from Valve could very well be lower.</p>



<p>That said, while Valve hasn't made any official announcements about the price, it's been made <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">clear from multiple sides of the tech industry that prices on hardware will increase</a> due to the current memory crisis, and when Valve was asked <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">if the company would be subsidizing the price of its new box</a>, the answer was a flat no.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>No, it's more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market</em>," began software engineer at Valve, Pierre-Loup Griffais. "<em></em><em>Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is."</em></p>



<p>So while we've seen pricing estimates from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">creators like LinusTechTips who've tried to guess at what the cost of the new box would be</a> and found that it might not be too expensive, the reality might not be as kind. Still, for what the Steam Machine could be capable of, paying a little more than $1k for it is arguably still a good deal, when you consider the freedom of choice you get with a Steam Machine versus a traditional console or the cost of building your own PC.</p>



<p>As for when we could hear official words from Valve on the price, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/"> latest reports point to a <strong>Spring 2026</strong> release</a>, and if that's true, then we'll know sooner than later what the actual price will be. </p>

			<p>The emulator just got even more simplified, which will make it convenient to run games directly from the ISO files. </p>



<h2 id="h-iso-based-disc-loading-comes-to-rpcs3-emulator-but-only-decrypted-isos-are-supported">ISO-Based Disc Loading Comes to RPCS3 Emulator, But Only Decrypted ISOs Are Supported</h2>



<p>The popular PlayStation 3 emulator, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-removes-amd-rx-400-500-and-nvidia-gtx-900-1000-series-from-recommended-gpu-requirements/">RPCS3</a>, just got a big update. Usually, one would need to extract the contents of the game ISO files to allow RPCS3 to run the game, but the new update just eliminated this step. Contributor <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Functionable </em>submitted the code, which removes a long-standing inconvenience for users who had to extract the disc images into folders to run the game. </p>



<p>This might look small on paper, but it is pretty meaningful and has several benefits. While the existing method of extracting the ISO files is reliable, it requires nearly double the storage, assuming the user doesn't delete the original ISO file. The new update allows loading the disc games directly from the ISO file and no longer needs manual extraction. So, not just one step less, but also no additional storage required.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>RPCS3 now supports loading disc games from ISO files, thanks to code submitted by Functionable! Note that only decrypted ISO loading is supported for now, encrypted ISO loading is not yet supported. Loading disc games from folders continues to be supported without any changes.</p>



<p>- RPCS3</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Keep in mind that the developers have announced that this will only apply to <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"decrypted" </strong>ISOs, and any encrypted ISO images that are directly dumped from retail PS3 discs won't run. PlayStation 3 already possesses the hardware and firmware-based encryption pipeline to decrypt discs, but RPCS3 does not. Also, the older method of extracting the ISO will still work like before, and those who have already maintained an organized folder-based library shouldn't worry. </p>
