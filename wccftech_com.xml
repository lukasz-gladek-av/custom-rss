			<p>Starfield 2 is going to be one hell of a game, according to a former Bethesda designer who worked on The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, as it will address much of the original game's criticism.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/starfield-2-one-hell-of-a-game-claims-designer-bethesda/?callback=in&amp;code=ODE2ZJC2NZYTM2Y4MC0ZMMJKLWI3NGQTZWUXMZU4NJBMNJMW&amp;state=22be1898c559444ca029c628e9f2b835" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoGamer</a>, Bruce Nesmith commented on the franchise, which was launched last year, highlighting how it has the chance to reach the same heights as The Elder Scrolls series over time. When the studio built Skyrim, they had the "tremendous advantage" of Oblivion, which, in turn, had the advantage of Morrowind. All the team had to do was continue to improve the formula and add new stuff, an advantage that Starfield did not have. For this reason, Bruce Nesmith is really looking forward to the second entry in the series, which he feels will be one hell of a game because it is going to address a lot of the things the original game is close to getting right. The sequel will be able to take everything that is in the original game, put new stuff in it, and address its issues. In a lot of ways, Starfield may end up becoming the next Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed, two series that had some troubled beginnings but then went on to become some of the most appreciated gaming series ever with multiple sequels.</p>
<p>It is indisputable that Starfield needs something more to become a memorable series like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Too many issues prevent the first game from reaching its full potential, and these issues have only become more evident over time, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review of the Shattered Space expansion.</a></p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>According to the newly released online manual for the soon-to-begin open beta, the lobbies of the latest entry in the series by CAPCOM will hold up to 100 players that can interact with one another. This is definitely a massive improvement over the previous entries in the series, which is sure to make the game's online experience better than ever before.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds open beta digital manual also provides plenty of additional information on some of the features hunters will be able to try out this week, such as cross-platform play and Link Parties, as well as going over some of the series' basics. You can find the manual <a href="https://manual.capcom.com/mhwilds/beta/en/ps5/page/6/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>While PS Plus subscribers will be able to try out the open beta in a few hours, PC and Xbox players will be able to join in the fun later this week when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta/">Monster Hunter Wilds open beta</a> opens up to everyone. The beta will allow players to try out the first few minutes of the full game and take part in a multiplayer hunting quest where they will have to take down an Alpha Doshaguma.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">preview.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/halo-5-guardians-pc-port-scrapped/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Halo 5: Guardians PC port was originally considered, but was later scrapped due to technical hurdles, according to a former member of the development team.</p>
<p>Former Halo developer Tyler Owens confirmed on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/heytred" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> that a PC port of the fifth entry in the popular Microsoft series was originally being considered but ran into "significant" tech hurdles and was later scrapped. The developer could not say which technical hurdles ultimately prevented the port, but there's a good chance it was due to the frame rate being tied to the physics, which was something that many developers were doing at the time the game was in development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I wish but it’s never going to happen imo. I think the port that was being considered ran into significant tech hurdles and was scrapped.</p>
<p>— Tyler Owens (@heytred) <a href="https://twitter.com/heytred/status/1850597419437916476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Probably, seems plausible - l honestly wasn’t as connected to high levels details on my role at the time.</p>
<p>— Tyler Owens (@heytred) <a href="https://twitter.com/heytred/status/1850598592324743322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While an official PC port of Halo 5: Guardians may never see the light of day, PC players will still be able to experience the game in some capacity in the future, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-5-guardians-pc/">XWine1 Xbox One translation layer</a>, which can already run the game in its current state. The layer has yet to be released to the public, but work is continuing <a href="https://x.com/XWineOne/status/1849794366216319198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily, </a>so it may not be long before the game will be available to players who don't have access to Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Halo 5: Guardians is now available on Xbox One, but it can also be played on any device that supports Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-gets-newest-patch-6-update-focusing-on-performance-improvements-for-older-amd-cpus/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>God of War Ragnarök PC has received a new patch update, explicitly focusing on performance improvements for AMD's "older" CPUs, notably Zen1 and Zen2.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarök was indeed a significant port by Jetpack Interactive when it comes to debuting with optimized performance and a bug-free experience, and with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-patch-4-frame-generation-improvements/">constant patch updates released by the developers</a> post-launch, it certainly has made the title a refined piece, especially when compared against other PC ports. Now, the latest Patch 6 (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/16143442/">SteamDB</a>) has brought in further refinements, explicitly focusing on consumers with older AMD CPUs, and has provided performance improvements in areas where the game was "CPU limited."</p>
<h4 id="updates"><em><strong>Updates</strong></em></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a crash in UI when opening certain Journal pages</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that could happen when controllers get disabled or enabled in rapid succession</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed a crash that would occur in various locations in Vanaheim</em></li>
<li><em>Improved performance of AMD Zen1 and Zen2 processors in areas where the game was CPU limited</em></li>
<li><em>Increased tessellation in Realm Between Realms back to PS5 quality</em></li>
<li><em>Note that the performance issue related to tessellation is resolved in NVIDIA drivers 565.90 or higher</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where lock on would rapidly bounce between targets when using mouse. It will now be more "sticky" requiring more effort to change targets</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where attack indicators would not look correct when using frame generation</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where cinematic dialogue audio would be lower volume than intended</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the performance improvements, the new Update 6 also brings fixes to crashes in locations such as Vanaheim and enhancements to the UI of certain Journal Pages. There have also been optimizations with Frame Generation, so the update is constructive for improving user experience. We haven't seen the improvements the new update has brought in with older AMD CPUs, but we shouldn't expect out-of-the-roof bumps in performance.</p>
<p>Steam will automatically download the update when you get the title running next time, and if you haven't experienced the game yet, you can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">&nbsp;review.</a></p>
