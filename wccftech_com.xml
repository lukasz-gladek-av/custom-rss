			<p>Late last year, it seemed like<em> Half-Life 3</em>, the third entry in the Valve series, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-rumors-intensify-on-27th-anniversary-original-game/"><strong>about to be announced</strong></a>. <span>Every&nbsp;<strong>available indication</strong>, whether </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/should-you-give-up-on-half-life-3-no-not-while-work-continues-on-hlx/"><strong><span>updates to the So</span>urce 2 engine</strong></a> or rumors from reliable insiders about <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/"><strong>a trailer in preparation</strong></a>, seemed to point to an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">imminent reveal before the end of 2025</a></strong>. </p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">However,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025 has ended</strong>&nbsp;without any confirmation of what the HLX project is, and the complete lack of information from the usual sources plunged the community into&nbsp;<strong>doom and gloom</strong>, with </span>many starting to doubt the game really exists, or believing it was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<p>While we still don't know if <strong>HLX is indeed the long-awaited Half-Life 3</strong>, we now know that development of the project is <strong>proceeding</strong>, at least in some capacity.</p>



<p><span>A few hours ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/2019536782279557428" target="_blank"><strong>Gabefollower</strong></a>, one of the most&nbsp;<strong>reliable sources</strong>&nbsp;of rumors about Valve's projects, confirmed on X that the latest&nbsp;<em>Deadlock</em>&nbsp;update<strong>&nbsp;includes some new mentions of the HLX project</strong>.</span> By itself, the new mentions don't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mean much</strong>, but at least they have confirmed that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"HLX survived Valve's winter break,"</em> as Gabefollower put.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">community reaction</strong> to the news that development of what is supposedly <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Half-Life 3</em> did not disappoint, divided between those<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> inhaling generous doses of hopium</strong> like <a href="https://x.com/Marcegonz19/status/2019542841836597746"><strong>X user Marcelo</strong></a> and those who believe <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Nothing Ever Happens,"</strong></em> like <a href="https://x.com/souvlaki420/status/2019544321591009472"><strong>X user tzatziki</strong></a>. Others, however, are <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">giving up hope</strong>, now believing <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">HLX is not the third entry in the series</strong>, but something else entirely.</p>



<p><em>'Gabe, I think that it's getting to a point that HLX isnt half life X or 3. I think it's just a new addition to games that could be for moderation, making the games better, or something else completely. Stop giving us hopium that eventually turns into dispairium,'</em> said <a href="https://x.com/d116223reb/status/2019602979784126694"><strong>X user dude3reborn</strong></a>. Was this <strong>a plea</strong> to Gabefollower or to Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve? Who knows, but this statement summarizes well the <strong>wild state</strong> the <em>Half-Life</em> community has been since it started to seem like <em>Half-Life 3</em> wasn't a fever dream, but a <strong>concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Although there's no <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">concrete indication</strong> that HLX could indeed be <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Half-Life 3</em>, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/">datamined discoveries</a></strong> made over the years suggest this project could be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a very interesting game</strong> coming with a lot of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unique mechanics</strong>, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fire and heat conductivity</strong>, a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gravity gun</strong> with complex physics mechanics likely used for puzzles, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">advanced NPC AI with superior hearing</strong> that, on paper, could make for <strong>a very immersive experience</strong>. As for when it will be <strong>revealed</strong>, it's really difficult to say at the moment. </p>

			<p><a href="https://www.origami.ng/ubisoft-vantage-cancel-league-assassins-creed-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the French website Origami</a>, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> has canceled a <strong>secret Assassin's Creed co-op game</strong> codenamed <strong>AC League</strong>. Origami, which has a solid track record, claims to have verified the information with six current Ubisoft employees before publishing the story.</p>



<p>First and foremost, it should be clarified that <strong>this is not <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-invictus-an-arcade-multiplayer-game-rumored-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed Invictus</a></strong>, the arcade Fall Guys-inspired PvP multiplayer game that was previously leaked to be in development. AC League was originally meant to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>rumored Assassin's Creed Shadows co-op mode</strong></a>, which later morphed into a standalone title. It was in development at <strong>Ubisoft Annecy</strong>, the studio that led development on <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/steep-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steep</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/riders-republic-beautiful-rocky-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riders Republic</a>,</strong> and also contributed to several Assassin's Creed games, including the multiplayer modes featured in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, Revelations, AC III, AC IV: Black Flag, and AC Unity.</p>



<p>According to the report, over the last year, the developer <strong>began questioning whether to keep League as a Shadows expansion: the DLC was seen as too long and costly to produce for the quality bar they wanted</strong>. They had two options on the table: either attach the co‑op framework onto another, more traditional Assassin's Creed game already in development elsewhere in the group, or shrink AC League's narrative and scope and pitch it as a small, standalone co‑op Assassin's Creed game built from the base of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Ubisoft Annecy pursued the second option, <strong>aiming to kick off invite‑only alpha sessions around May</strong> to test the game, refine it, and then get a formal greenlight. In the game, parties of up to four assassins would tackle missions together, presumably in a similar fashion to <strong>Assassin's Creed Unity</strong>, the last title to support online cooperative multiplayer.</p>



<p>As to the circumstances of the game's cancellation, Origami reports that <strong>executives from the newly created <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vantage Studios</a> subsidiary have been carefully reviewing each and every internal project</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and canceling plenty of them</a>). Just last week, after an internal play session, <strong>the project leads behind AC League were informed that the decision had been made to shut down the project</strong>. Annecy had put around 85 of its roughly 270 employees on this project.</p>



<p>While AC League is effectively dead, <strong>the co-op tech base developed by Ubisoft Annecy is reportedly being salvaged</strong> for potential new pitches to be attached to future Assassin's Creed games. Those co-op modes will have to be much cheaper to make than AC League was shaping up to be, though, which led to its cancellation.</p>
