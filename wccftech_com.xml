			<p>Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=150949805&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> via Game File that the Perfect Dark reboot recently added a new Creative Director: Brian Horton. He's an industry veteran with credits dating back all the way to Disney: Pocahontas, released in 1996 for the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive console.</p>
<p>Most of his credits are in the art department. He was, for instance, the Senior Art Director for Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider while at Crystal Dynamics. Horton then switched to a Creative Director position when he did a couple of years <a href="http://wccftech.com/rise-tomb-raider-art-director-leaves-crystal-dynamics-join-infinity-ward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at Infinity Ward</a> and kept the same role when he joined Insomniac to work on Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. More recently, he was the creative director of the upcoming game Marvel's Wolverine, which Horton <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolverine-ps5-full-size-mature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> briefly three years ago. Given that the Perfect Dark game is largely being developed at Crystal Dynamics in a joint venture with The Initiative, this is a return home for Horton. An Xbox spokesperson told Game File:</p>
<p><em>Brian Horton will be bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series.</em></p>
<p>We finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got </a>our first look at the game during this Summer's Xbox Games Showcase. The gameplay trailer was definitely promising and we also learned a few concrete details. The developers have taken inspiration from elements of the first two installments while creating an entirely new story and universe for the reboot.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark will be a single-player experience with a set of missions that offer various choices on how players complete them. Traversal and gadgets are going to be very important. The focus was on creating an intuitive movement system to let players find interesting ways to tackle their tasks. The combat system has been designed to allow for both melee and gunplay, stealth, and gadgets. Supposedly, the development teams want to blend elements from first-person shooters, immersive simulations, and stealth games into a cohesive whole, delivering a complete secret agent fantasy.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark doesn't have a release date yet, but it will launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X. As all games developed by studios owned by Microsoft, it will be available on Game Pass from day one. As for Marvel's Wolverine, Horton has been replaced by Marcus Smith as the new Creative Director for Insomniac's game.</p>

			<p>Early signs on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 sales and overall reception were great, and now we have confirmation from Microsoft and Activision. During the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-fy25-q1-total-gaming-revenue-up-by-43-all-from-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q1 2025 earnings</a> call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that the game set new franchise records and also helped the Game Pass subscription service reach records of its own.</p>
<p><em>One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and services. You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger.</em></p>
<p><em>Last week's launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day 1 players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. And unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on.</em></p>
<p>Granted, there were little doubts in both cases. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is, after all, the first new game in the franchise to launch day and date on Game Pass, which would inevitably have expanded its player base (and the subscription service's user base). The bigger question is whether, in the long term, this will be financially beneficial compared to the traditional way the game has been sold before the massive acquisition.</p>
<p>Activision is also celebrating, of course. The official X account revealed that, unsurprisingly, Black Ops 6 has registered the biggest opening weekend ever for Call of Duty in terms of total players, hours played, and total matches. Moreover, the publisher <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> The Washington Post that the first-person shooter franchise has now surpassed 500 million units since its debut twenty-one years ago.</p>
