			<p><a href="https://www.origami.ng/ubisoft-vantage-cancel-league-assassins-creed-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the French website Origami</a>, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> has canceled a <strong>secret Assassin's Creed co-op game</strong> codenamed <strong>AC League</strong>. Origami, which has a solid track record, claims to have verified the information with six current Ubisoft employees before publishing the story.</p>



<p>First and foremost, it should be clarified that <strong>this is not <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-invictus-an-arcade-multiplayer-game-rumored-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed Invictus</a></strong>, the arcade Fall Guys-inspired PvP multiplayer game that was previously leaked to be in development. AC League was originally meant to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>rumored Assassin's Creed Shadows co-op mode</strong></a>, which later morphed into a standalone title. It was in development at <strong>Ubisoft Annecy</strong>, the studio that led development on <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/steep-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steep</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/riders-republic-beautiful-rocky-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riders Republic</a>,</strong> and also contributed to several Assassin's Creed games, including the multiplayer modes featured in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, Revelations, AC III, AC IV: Black Flag, and AC Unity.</p>



<p>According to the report, over the last year, the developer <strong>began questioning whether to keep League as a Shadows expansion: the DLC was seen as too long and costly to produce for the quality bar they wanted</strong>. They had two options on the table: either attach the co‑op framework onto another, more traditional Assassin's Creed game already in development elsewhere in the group, or shrink AC League's narrative and scope and pitch it as a small, standalone co‑op Assassin's Creed game built from the base of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Ubisoft Annecy pursued the second option, <strong>aiming to kick off invite‑only alpha sessions around May</strong> to test the game, refine it, and then get a formal greenlight. In the game, parties of up to four assassins would tackle missions together, presumably in a similar fashion to <strong>Assassin's Creed Unity</strong>, the last title to support online cooperative multiplayer.</p>



<p>As to the circumstances of the game's cancellation, Origami reports that <strong>executives from the newly created <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vantage Studios</a> subsidiary have been carefully reviewing each and every internal project</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and canceling plenty of them</a>). Just last week, after an internal play session, <strong>the project leads behind AC League were informed that the decision had been made to shut down the project</strong>. Annecy had put around 85 of its roughly 270 employees on this project.</p>



<p>While AC League is effectively dead, <strong>the co-op tech base developed by Ubisoft Annecy is reportedly being salvaged</strong> for potential new pitches to be attached to future Assassin's Creed games. Those co-op modes will have to be much cheaper to make than AC League was shaping up to be, though, which led to its cancellation.</p>

			<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline reports</a> that <span><strong>a Baldur's Gate 3 HBO series is now underway</strong>, with&nbsp;<strong>Craig Mazin</strong>&nbsp;attached as&nbsp;</span>creator, writer, showrunner, and executive producer. Mazin is primarily known for his acclaimed work on the TV shows <strong>Chernobyl</strong> and <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, the latter of which is particularly relevant because it's also an adaptation of a game. Previously in his career, he also co-wrote the screenplays for movies like Scary Movie 3 and 4, The Hangover Part II and III, and The Huntsman: Winter's War.</p>



<p>The big difference compared to the adaptation of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us is that the Baldur's Gate 3 HBO series will pick up from the end of the game made by <strong>Larian Studios</strong> and continue from there. On the one hand, this is perfect because Larian famously <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided against doing Baldur's Gate 3 DLCs or even a sequel</a></strong>, opting to <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make a new game based on its own <strong>Divinity IP</strong></a>. Many fans who loved characters like <strong>Astarion, Shadowheart, Gale, Karlach, Lae'zel, Wyll</strong>, and <strong>Halsin</strong> were eager to learn what would happen to them next. </p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong>there's the little issue that one of the game's main features is the ability for players to influence the events in major ways</strong>. For instance, in my playthrough, I killed both Lae'zel and Astarion. Even setting aside such extreme measures, the creators of the Baldur's Gate 3 HBO series will inevitably have to choose a specific thread for each character from among the various choices originally available in the cRPG.</p>



<p>Anyway, Mazin will be helped by executive producers <strong>Jacqueline Lesko</strong>, <strong>Cecil O’Connor</strong>, and <strong>Hasbro Entertainment's Gabriel Marano</strong>. Moreover, <strong>Chris Perkins</strong>, the former Head of Story at <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>, will be involved as a consultant. Craig Mazin shared the following statement to go along with the news:</p>



<p><em>After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of Baldur’s Gate 3, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created. I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can’t wait to help bring Baldur’s Gate and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I’m deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property.</em></p>



<p>Deadline's report adds that alongside characters from the game, the Baldur's Gate 3 HBO series will also feature some new ones. Indeed, it does sound like the new characters could be the main protagonists, though that remains unclear at the time being. By the way, <strong>Mazin has reportedly reached out to some of the game's excellent voice cast to participate in the adaptation in some capacity</strong>. There are no dates yet, but we know Mazin is preparing to shoot <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the third and final season of The Last of Us adaptation</a>. Presumably, his next project will be Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Lastly, if you were wondering whether game developer Larian would be involved in any way, <strong>CEO Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a> that the endings were written specifically to serve as the base for new adventures, and added that <strong>Mazin has already reached out to them to have a chat about the TV show</strong>, so there's a chance Larian might pass on some of their ideas.</p>
