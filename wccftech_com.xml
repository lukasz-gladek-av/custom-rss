			<p>The battle between KRAFTON and Subnautica 2 developers Unknown Worlds, has escalated even further, as the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds' co-founders, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill is now unsealed, revealing the full details regarding why the co-founders are suing KRAFTON for a breach of contract.</p>



<p>If you want to get a recap on what's happened so far, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">check out a bullet point list here</a> that goes through all the events in this saga so far. Today's story comes from the fact that the lawsuit the co-founders filed is <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">now available to read in full</a>, if you're so inclined. </p>



<p>Some key context, if you've not been following this story, is that when Unknown Worlds was acquired by KRAFTON in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">2021</a>, it did so for $500 million, with an additional $250 million to be paid out as a bonus to the studio if it hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. On paper, the three co-founders and 40 employees at Unknown Worlds were due to receive a portion of that bonus, with the co-founders receiving the bulk of it. The co-founders also stipulate that they would have spread the wealth even further to the other members of the team who were not due to receive the bonus on paper.</p>



<p>According to the co-founders, Unknown Worlds' relationship with KRAFTON only started to deteriorate when KRAFTON realized that Subnautica 2 launching in early access by the end of this year would have meant the studio hitting and surpassing the revenue targets required to unlock the $250 million bonus. </p>



<p>The suit even adds that KRAFTON's chief executive officer, Changhan Kim, admitted to the Unknown Worlds co-founders that if Subnautica 2 was released in early access in 2025, and Unknown Worlds hit its revenue targets to unlock the $250 million bonus, "<em>it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for KRAFTON</em>." The company now denies that Kim made such an admission, and blames it on translators misinterpreting Kim's words, despite that never being an issue previously.</p>



<p>"<em>So KRAFTON engaged in a months-long campaign to delay Subnautica 2's release,</em>" the suit reads. "<em>It pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important pre-launch tasks. Multiple KRAFTON employees themselves suggested that these moves were for the purposes of frustrating the earnout, despite the earnout agreement's prohibition on taking actions for that purpose</em>."</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds would not be swayed by these sabotage measures, and members of the studio took it upon themselves to do the things its publisher, KRAFTON, should have been doing. It's at this point where we catch up to the events that began on July 2, with the three co-founders being fired. </p>



<p>"<em>In flagrant disregard of the parties' contract, KRAFTON terminated without cause three former owners of Unknown Worlds - Charles Cleveland, Adam "Max" McGuire, and Edward "Ted" Gill (the "Founders") - and seized control of the company. KRAFTON's first decision upon taking over? To delay the launch of Subnautica 2 until sometime in 2026. That way, KRAFTON could keep the game's revenue for itself, while avoiding the $250 million earnout it would likely have owed the Founders and other Unknown Worlds employees.</em>"</p>



<p>The lawsuit also attacks claims made by KRAFTON, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">previously claimed</a> that Cleveland and the other co-founders had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at Unknown Worlds in order to work on a "<em>personal film project</em>." According to the suit, the co-founders were working on a film. A Subnautica movie, that KRAFTON had asked the co-founders to work on.</p>



<p>It further attacks claims made by KRAFTON that Subnautica 2 was not ready for early access launch. In the milestone review documents that were leaked and subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed to be real by KRAFTON</a>, the publisher claims that Subnautica 2 was lacking content, and that based on player feedback from internal playtests, it had to be delayed into 2026. </p>



<p>According to the co-founders' lawsuit, the 'experts' KRAFTON hired to deem Subnautica 2 as unfit weren't experts at all and had no experience developing and releasing early access titles. The co-founders also flat-out disagreed with the assessment of player feedback from the internal playtests, saying that the feedback in fact "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" that Subnautica 2 was ready to launch.</p>



<p>The lawsuit also alleges that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">statement made on the Unknown Worlds website</a> confirming the delay of Subnautica 2 was written by KRAFTON, after the publisher took control of the site and published without the knowledge of anyone at Unknown Worlds.</p>



<p>"<em>In short, KRAFTON flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds. It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without cause. Promise broken</em>...<em>In the name of its bottom line, KRAFTON has thrown its promises out the window and ripped the game from the hands of both its creators and its community</em>."</p>



<p>KRAFTON now has the task of trying to argue against these claims. We'll continue to update you on this story as more details become public and as KRAFTON tries to fire back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An Assassin's Creed live-action TV series has been officially greenlit by Netflix, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4tiTYS8oDJ3ygEoJHIyrdQ/netflix-greenlights-assassins-creed-liveaction-series">confirmed</a> today.</p>



<p>The show, which will follow characters across pivotal historical events as they get involved in the sceret war between two faction, one determined to shape humanity's future through control, the other fighting to preserve free will, essentially running with the same premise of the video game series focused on the long way between the Assassins and the Templars, is the first series to be developed under the agreement signed back in 2020 between Ubisoft and Netflix to produce content based on the popular series. Emmy nominees Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing) are set as creators, showrunners, and executive producers of the newly announced show.</p>



<p><em>"We've been fans of Assassin's Creed since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that Assassin's Creed opens to us,"</em> said David Wiener and Rober Patino in a statement. <em>"Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story - about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it's about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We've got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we're committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet."</em></p>



<p>The latest entry in the Ubisoft series is Assassin's Creed Shadows.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-reportedly-trying-%E2%80%9Chail-mary%E2%80%9D-tactics-to-make-its-lawsuit-against-palworld-makers-stick.1246233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">confirmed it would be suing Pocketpair</a>, the studio behind last year's massive hit Palworld, many saw this as an inevitable outcome considering how litigious Nintendo is on a good day.</p>



<p>While the suit is still ongoing, and Pocketpair has already been forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-developer-outlines-game-changes-caused-by-the-nintendo-lawsuit/">make changes to Palworld</a> based on the patents Nintendo is claiming Pocketpair is infringing on, a new report from <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-resorts-to-weird-patent-claims-as-its-litigation-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair-is-struggling/">Gamefrays</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/nintendo-is-taking-desperate-measures-in-patent-infringement-case-against-palworld-and-its-looking-a-little-weird">Windows Central</a>) seems to show that Nintendo is doing everything and anything to make its suit against Pocketpair stick, even going so far as to change the patents it claims Pocketpair is infringing on, mid-suit. </p>



<p>Gamefrays does stipulate that changing a patent in the middle of an infringement suit isn't entirely unheard of, though it's usually done when the patent owner is concerned that its original patent will be found to have been invalid in the first place. It also doesn't necessarily mean that Nintendo is on the back foot or that it'll lose the case. Though, Gamefrays does point out that Nintendo's new language for the patent is awkward at best, which makes the change all the more weird.</p>



<p>Gamefrays calls out Nintendo's use of the phrases "<em>even when</em>" and "<em>even if</em>," neither of which is common when writing patents, nor are they clear to define in patent law. According to its report, Gamefrays calls the use of the word "<em>even</em>" and Nintendo's changes to the patents a "<em>Hail Mary</em>" move to try and secure a win for its suit in Japan. </p>



<p>Another unfortunate update on the lawsuit for Nintendo, is that it doesn't seem like it'll be able to bring a suit against Pocketpair in the US. The changes Pocketpair has already made, and the evidence Pocketpair is presenting around games with similar mechanics to Palworld that Nintendo has not gone after, all seem to be the immovable objects blocking Nintendo's path to suing Pocketpair in the US. Not that it won't keep trying, of course. </p>
