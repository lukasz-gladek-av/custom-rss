			<p>NVIDIA's weekly GeForce NOW Thursday update focuses on two classic PC games that just got remastered: The Thing and Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Thing: Remastered</a> enhances 2002's third-person shooter game based on John Carpenter's seminal 1982 movie. Computer Artworks originally developed the game, but the remaster was handled by Nightdive, the studio behind so many excellent remasters (System Shock, Turok, Doom 64, Shadowman, Quake, Quake II, Star Wars: Dark Forces) and the recent full-fledged remake of System Shock. Once again, they delivered a great PC remaster that adds anti-aliasing, per-pixel lighting, 4K resolution and up to 144 frames per second. On GeForce NOW, Performance tier subscribers can play up to 1440p, while Ultimate tier subscribers can play at up to 4K and 120 frames per second.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521380/Legacy_of_Kain_Soul_Reaver_12_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered</a>, on the other hand, celebrates the franchise's 25th anniversary with a remaster of Raziel's classic tale of vampiric vengeance. The game originally developed by Crystal Dynamic has been remastered by Aspyr, another development studio well versed with remasters (but not with remakes, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> with Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic), and it features cut-scenes rendered with higher fidelity models, brand new hero models for Raziel and Kain, new enemy and boss models, a new glow effect to Raziel's eyes and the Wraith Blade, real-time shadows applied to all characters and objects, a Day and Night cycle that was cut from the final version of the original game, a Photo Mode, and a brand new map and compass.</p>
<p>Of course, earlier this week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> also became playable via GeForce NOW wherever you have the license for it (Steam, Microsoft Store, and PC Game Pass). GFN Ultimate subscribers can even enable the gorgeous path tracing that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added </a>on Monday with the first update.</p>
<p>The rest of the weekly GeForce NOW list includes the following additions to the cloud platform's library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Food Simulator (New release on Steam, Dec. 10)</li>
<li>The Spirit of the Samurai (New release on Steam, Dec. 12)</li>
<li>Diablo Immortal (Battle.net)</li>
<li>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria (Steam)</li>
</ul>

			<p>A Mafia: The Old Country ad has leaked online today ahead of the game's showing at tonight's The Game Awards show, providing a quick look at the game's visuals and its release window.</p>
<p>The ad, which can be watched below courtesy of X user <a href="https://x.com/DJari2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damon Andrews</a>, likely went live before it was intended, as it features some short sequences that look like part of a bigger trailer, possibly the one that is coming later tonight during The Game Awards 2024 show, providing a quick look at the game's visuals, which look gorgeous even in the off-screen low-quality recording. The ad also confirms a Summer 2025 release window for the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">SUMMER 2025 <a href="https://t.co/njHNxoWttW">pic.twitter.com/njHNxoWttW</a></p>
<p>â€” Damon Andrews (@DJari2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/DJari2020/status/1867162950349320328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Mafia: The Old Country, developer Hangar 13 will go back to the<a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/"> roots of what fans loved about the franchise</a>, featuring a deep, linear narrative with a classic mob movie feeling, a stunning Italian setting that will allow players to learn the origins of organized crime in Sicily and more that will make for a highly immersive package.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country is currently in development for PC and consoles and will launch sometime next Summer. Stay tuned for a better look at the next entry in the series coming<a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/"> later today.</a></p>
