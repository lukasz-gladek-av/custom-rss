			<p>Somehow, over 25 years of Halo content has leaked online, showing off some of the classic designs of the game before it was even released. The leaked content seems to have originated from a <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-co-developer-certain-affinity-was-acquired-by-keywords/">Halo Studios</a> collaboration<a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1872256501982839002%7Ctwgr%5Ec6b6f375408eaad6b9e74c85bc73019a4ea93aac%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fover-25-years-of-classic-halo-content-has-leaked-online%2F"> with modders</a> who are fans of the franchise, where they aimed to restore cut content from previous Halo titles. This included the Halo 2 E3 2003 demo, which was released last month. The demo that was showcased at E3 2003 is available on the Steam Workshop after being added on November 9 as a mod for Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</p>
<p>The mod team has been working alongside Halo Studios since last summer to restore content from the games that never made it to the final cut. This includes multiplayer maps that were specifically designed for the PC port of Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>
<p>There is a lot of content to sift through, and Halo fans are going to have a field day with the content that is now available, thanks to the modders from Digsite. One of the most significant pieces of Halo content that has resurged, thanks to their efforts, is the Macworld demo from 1999. It was supposedly meant to be restored for Halo: The Master Chief Collection, but that didn't happen. This demo shows that Halo was originally meant to be a third-person exclusive title for Mac, but it eventually shifted perspectives and ended up going to Xbox instead.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that the content that has leaked online is legitimate, but a former member of Digsite said that none of the current or former members of the team are responsible. There is over 100 GB of content for Halo fans to explore, even though it's uncertain at the moment who even leaked the content in the first place, as it's been confirmed that no one from Digsite would do so.</p>
<p>Additionally, a significant amount of members from the Digsite team have quit the project as there has been a dispute over the team doing the work for free and that they haven't been given sufficient pay or resources to continue working on such a hefty project.</p>
<p>Lots of <a href="https://x.com/BajatomicBlast/status/1872350986280558818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1872350986280558818%7Ctwgr%5E432819c51648dcc4b0d99ffec9d1c81373e28c4c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fover-25-years-of-classic-halo-content-has-leaked-online%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments</a> from the team at Digsite can be found on social media, especially X. They have spoken about how the Halo E3 demo was reportedly more important than anything else they worked on, but they are still not getting paid for their efforts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-black-myth-wukong-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Black Myth: Wukong PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler implementation is among the best we have seen to date for an Unreal Engine 5-powered game, according to an in-depth analysis shared online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the latest patch released for Game Science's popular game released earlier this year, highlighting how it enhances the game on PlayStation 5 Pro. For Quality Mode, the patch introduces PSSR support, which upscales a roughly 1296p resolution input to 4K resolution and offers a noticeably sharper image compared to the base model. Some visual elements, such as noisy hair on the first boss, are much cleaner with PSSR than with AMD FSR, and lighting is generally more stable with PSSR than in other UE5-powered games like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-playstation-5-pro-looks-better-performance-mode/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, although this could be related to the lighting stability that was already exhibited on the base console. As such, Black Myth: Wukong's PSSR implementation ends up being solid, without any glaring issues outside the typical artifacts also seen in other games.</p>
<p>Balance Mode in Black Myth: Wukong on PlayStation 5 Pro is similar to Quality Mode, as it uses PSSR to upscale an internal resolution of 1296 to 4K, but features some visual differences, such as lower resolution textures and some Lumen tweaks. As opposed to the 30 FPS framerate of Quality Mode, however, the game generally runs at 40 FPS at 120 Hz output in this mode, resulting in a responsive experience with steady frame pacing. Performance mode, on the other hand, hasn't changed much over the base model, still using frame generation to hit 60 FPS at 1080p resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong Updated! PlayStation 5 Pro Support Added - But Is Base PS5 Improved Too?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAkyg8r3A_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The solid PlayStation 5 PSSR implementation in Black Myth: Wukong is definitely promising, as the upscaler has produced some very hit-and-miss results so far. Hopefully, the AI-powered upscaler will indeed be improved as it is being suggested by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">developers</a>, and reach the same heights as NVIDIA DLSS, which continues to be the best upscaler around.</p>

			<p>It might not be much longer until we actually see something new about Everwild. The upcoming project in development at Rare has been shrouded in mystery ever since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> over five years ago at the X019 special event hosted by Microsoft.</p>
<p>While the game received <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-new-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another trailer</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, Rare studio head Craig Duncan <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-gameplay-ideas-are-still-being-brainstormed-says-rare-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> at the same time that gameplay ideas were still being brainstormed. In 2021, reliable rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-rebooted-from-scratch-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the Everwild project had restarted from scratch, with an 'optimistic' 2024 release window target we now know wasn't met. Later that year, insider Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that even the people working on it still weren't quite sure what it would become.</p>
<p>The silence continued to stretch until late last year when Rare <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-fans-hopes-are-rekindled-by-new-job-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a video producer ad for Everwild. You don't hire a video producer unless the game has made it far enough in development that you can think about producing video content to share with the public. Sure enough, even insiders are starting to align, with Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-reportedly-progressing-well-at-long-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing</a> in October that the gameplay loop has finally been nailed down and development is finally progressing well.</p>
<p>Now, Rare has decided to greet its Instagram fans with an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DD_nmQTs-3a/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everwild themed Christmas card</a> this year. Needless to say, this fueled hopes that we might see this title again at some point next year, perhaps during the regular Xbox Summer Showcase. This doesn't necessarily mean it would launch next year, of course, but if even the developer is starting to tease it, a new trailer might be on the way.</p>
<p>It would certainly be nice if Rare clarified what it's going to be about. From the brief trailers we previously got, it looks as if the players will explore a vast wilderness while helping animals rather than hunting them, as in most games.</p>
