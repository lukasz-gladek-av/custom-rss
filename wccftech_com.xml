			<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaming-copilot-installing-automatically-on-windows-11-pcs-now-trains-microsofts-models-on-users-pc-gameplay.1332163/">user on ResetEra spotted</a> that as part of their network traffic, Microsoft's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Gaming Copilot AI</a>, which is automatically installed on Windows 11 PCs, was sending screenshots and captures of everything they were playing back to Microsoft, so Microsoft could use that data to train its AI models further. The setting is on by default, which means that unless you turn it off, Microsoft is using your gaming time to train its AI.</p>



<p>Wccftech can confirm that when you navigate to Game Bar, and then to Settings, and Privacy Settings, the option for Gaming Copilot to pull "<em>Model training on text</em>" is defaulted to being activated. I found the setting activated on my own laptop, before turning it off.</p>



<p>There's also options for Gaming Copilot to train using any vocal conversations you have while playing games, though that was not defaulted to being 'on,' when we looked at our settings. It'll also capture personalization and memory data, and of course, keep track of any conversations you have with Gaming Copilot, if you were actually using the service.</p>



<p>You can turn all of these settings off and/or ensure they're off by going into Game Bar, then to Gaming Copilot, then the Settings gear, which should be in the bottom left corner, and then lastly Privacy settings. There, you'll be able to turn off, or at least knowingly opt in to letting Gaming Copilot train on your gameplay, instead of it being on by default.</p>



<p>In the past month or so, Microsoft has done nothing, it seems, but be a public disappointment for players. The price of the Xbox Series consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">went up in the US for the second time this year</a>, followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">a price hike for Xbox development kits</a>, meaning even game devs have to pay more for Xbox hardware. The price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Xbox Game Pass went up 50%</a>, while at the same time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">reward programs</a> for Xbox software and services were shut down. And in the midst of all of that, we can probably expect a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-preparing-free-ad-supported-version-xbox-cloud-gaming/">version of Cloud Gaming with ads</a>. </p>



<p>Now, the latest is that Microsoft is training its AI with your gameplay, almost definitely without you strictly knowing about it.</p>



<p>None of it exactly endears Xbox and Microsoft to players, but it does at least seem par for the course for a company that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">laid off 9,000+ people to bet more on AI.</a></p>
