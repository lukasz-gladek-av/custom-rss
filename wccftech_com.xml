			<p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3m5l5wetmus2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> on the social network BlueSky by Gematsu, the GRAC (Game Rating and Administration Committee), the South Korean game rating board, has officially rated <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?c7b8077c36ff1119491eb25bd5560ffba6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?f0d05826089a46822d078e3eb6681337a6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is a Dead Man</a> today.</p>



<p>The first one is CAPCOM's new science fiction intellectual property. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in June 2020, ahead of the release of the new consoles (Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox SerieS and X), Pragmata was scheduled to launch in 2022, but it received several delays. Just when fans had nearly lost hope of ever playing it, the third-person action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced this June with a gameplay trailer</a> and the promise of a 2026 launch window. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to play the game</a> at Gamescom 2025, and CAPCOM later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed the fan speculation</a> that it was a 'secret Mega Man game'.</p>



<p>The GRAC rated the game for ages 12 and up with the following description:</p>



<ul>
<li>An action adventure game about the protagonist 'Hugh' and the android 'Diana' joining forces to defeat enemies and return to Earth.</li>



<li>Mild violence (battles hostile robot/AI forces using weapons).</li>
</ul>



<p>Romeo Is a Dead Man is also a sci-fi action/adventure game, although it is developed by Grasshoppers under the luminary guidance of Goichi Suda, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed at Gamescom 2025</a>. Those familiar with Suda51's games will know his games generally include mature themes, and indeed, the GRAC prohibited the game to minors with the following description:</p>



<ul>
<li>A sci-fi action adventure game in which the protagonist, Romeo Stargazer, becomes an FBI space-time special agent, Deadman, and chases down wanted criminals who travel across time and space due to time paradoxes.</li>



<li>Excessive violence (attacks using various weapons, frequent large amounts of blood, and various expressions of bodily harm.</li>



<li>Specific expressions of vulgar profanity and vulgar language (use of vulgar profanity and vulgar language such as “F<em>ck,” “Shit,” “F</em>ck,” “F*cker up,” and “Motherfucker”)</li>



<li>Excessive expressions that induce fear and disgust (creation of a terrifying and disgusting monster and atmosphere, expressions of blood and bodily harm that induce disgust).</li>
</ul>



<p>More than the ratings themselves, though, there's the fact that the GRAC usually rates games only when they are close to their scheduled launches. This year, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was rated</a> four months in advance of its debut, for instance, and the same happened to <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-version-gets-rated-by-south-korean-game-rating-and-administration-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good and Evil Anniversary Edition</a> in 2024.</p>



<p>In all likelihood, then, both Pragmata and Romeo Is a Dead Man are launching in the first half of 2026, and their definitive release dates could be announced very soon, possibly at the upcoming The Game Awards event. CAPCOM is gearing up for an explosive calendar year, between <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> (out on February 27, 2026), Pragmata, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gamescom-hands-on-preview-two-heavens-as-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, which is likely coming in the latter half of 2026.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.moddb.com/downloads/maxpayne2remixmod-by-darko913">A new Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod</a> introduces path tracing to a few early locations, offering stunning visuals. However, even on high-end GPUs like the RTX 5080, this lighting technology proves to be a true performance killer without proper optimization.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the modded version with path tracing and the vanilla version of the second entry in the series running side by side at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how some locations look stunning with path tracing. </p>



<p>At the same time, the comparison video clearly shows how path tracing is extremely taxing on current gaming hardware: with performance dropping from 1,255 FPS in the vanilla game to just 38 FPS in the mod in some instances, an RTX 5080 with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode takes a hit of over 1,200 FPS, representing an astonishing 97% performance drop overall. It's only with Frame Generation that the modded game reaches playable framerates above 60 FPS.</p>

<iframe title="Max Payne 2 Path Tracing with RTX Remix - One of the Most Impressive RTX Remix Mods | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLerlkr2nVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-path-tracing-requires-optimization-to-be-viable">Path Tracing Requires Optimization to Be Viable</h2>



<p>The massive performance hit seen in the Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod is far from being an uncommon occurrence, as almost every classic game that has received a path tracing overhaul sees similar performance drops. Among them is the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-rtx-remix-annihaltes-performance-4080/">original Max Payne</a>, which also sees performance drops in the 1000 FPS range on high-end GPUs, the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">Half-Life remake Black Mesa</a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">Left 4 Dead 2</a>. </p>



<p>This makes it even clearer how the demanding tech requires optimization work in conjunction with upscaling (and sometimes Frame Generation) to deliver acceptable performance, as demonstrated by some of the best implementations of the tech in recent years, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-continues-impressive-showcase/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rtx-remix-remasters-may-continue-to-be-the-best-option-to-update-classic-games-in-the-future">RTX Remix Remasters May Continue to Be The Best Option to Update Classic Games in the Future</h2>



<p>Although the current RTX Remix mods generally require very powerful hardware to run at playable framerates, these overhauls are likely to continue offering the best remaster option for games that won't receive official updates implementing the latest graphics tech. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Among these is&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto 4,</a>&nbsp;whose eventual remaster is unlikely to receive path tracing support,</span> based on<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"> the remasters released so far by Rockstar Games</a><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">.</span></p>



<p>Hopefully, gaming hardware will eventually catch up to make these unofficial remasters playable by the majority of players, even those without access to top-end hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, developer NCSOFT has talked about the game as part of its wider lineup (<a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-launch-globally-second-half-2026-monetization-less-aggressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aion 2</a>, Time Takers, Cinder City, Limit Zero Breakers) in a dedicated session at G-Star 2025, <a href="https://m.ruliweb.com/news/read/217907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as reported by Ruliweb</a>.</p>



<p>During development, Horizon Steel Frontiers was known as Project Skyline, and apparently, it was believed that it would employ 'AI NPCs'. When asked that question, though, NCSOFT focused instead on the fact that AI is being used 'extensively' in the game's production, and that they expect it to be used even more in future games.   </p>



<p><em>We're testing and receiving assistance internally through collaborations with basic NPCs and combat. Since we're an action RPG, we don't play with a large number of players, but rather determine the optimal number of players, and we receive assistance in various aspects. Internally, we also rely on AI for production, from coding to art. It 's being widely adopted in the field, and I think the technologies will gradually become known. The Horizon Steel Frontiers development team is also the one most eager to utilize AI. It's being used a lot, and you'll see that games coming out after Aion 2 will greatly increase their use of AI.</em></p>



<p>In the Q&amp;A published by Ruliweb, NCSOFT adds that the focus will be on PvE cooperation, although Guerrilla had mentioned some sort of competition with other tribes in the announcement video. When it comes to the release window, the Korean studio reiterated the release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported from the NCSOFT quarterly earnings call</a>: late 2026 or early 2027, with public testing scheduled to take place at some point next year.</p>



<p>In case MMORPGs are not your cup of tea and the announcement of Horizon Steel Frontiers did nothing for you, Guerrilla Games is still making <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own cooperative multiplayer version of the franchise</a>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-guerilla-has-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed once again</a> by Jason Schreier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The open world action/adventure game Immortals Fenyx Rising is now free to grab <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/immortals-fenyx-rising/5cec210a39798c0870c07684.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Ubisoft Connect</a> (PC) until December 2. The offer is Ubisoft's way to celebrate the fifth anniversary of its own ecosystem.</p>



<p>Immortals Fenyx Rising was developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the same team that led development of Assassin's Creed Odyssey and most recently launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The game debuted in December 2020 to a generally favorable reception. On Wccftech, it earned an 8 out of 10 score from Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-breath-titan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote at the time</a>:</p>



<p><em>At the end of the day, I enjoyed Immortals Fenix Rising way more than I thought I would. The first impressions were pretty bad, but as the game progressed and more options became available, I found myself fully engrossed in the tale of Fenyx and his war against the terrible Typhon, smiling at the jokes told by Prometheus and Zeus, and loving every second of gliding around the Golden Isle in search of treasure. Sure, the game is not innovative at all, but the way every little element and mechanic comes together makes it easy to look past this issue and enjoy one of the best open-world games put out by Ubisoft in recent years.</em></p>



<p>As usual in these cases, Ubisoft is actually gifting you the Standard Edition. However, it also happens that the DLCs are currently heavily discounted (-65%). You can pick <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-a-new-god-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A New God</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-the-lost-gods-review-ash-rising-from-the-fenyx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lost Gods</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/immortals-fenyx-rising-myths-of-the-eastern-realm-some-stories-are-better-left-untold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Myths of the Eastern Realm</a> for $2.80 each, or just grab the Season Pass at $7.00 to get access to all the DLCs.</p>



<p>In July 2022, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-will-be-based-on-hawaiian-polynesian-culture-game-is-still-in-early-pre-production-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surfaced</a> that an Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel was in early pre-production at Ubisoft Quebec and would center around Hawaiian Polynesian Culture. However, in July 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-to-prioritize-assassins-creed-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to cancel the project</a>, ensuring the team would focus entirely on Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In other Ubisoft news, the publisher has unexpectedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> its quarterly and half-year financial results, sparking speculation that an acquisition (possibly by Tencent) may be announced imminently.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/asus-says-market-response-to-xbox-rog-ally-has-been-extremely-positive/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Like many other companies this week, Taiwanese computer, electronics, and phone manufacturer ASUS posted its quarterly reports, and Chief Financial Officer Nick Wu spoke about the new ROG Ally products, released last month in partnership with Xbox. During the Q3 2025 investor call, Wu claimed the market response has been highly positive, and demand for these pricier devices has surprised even ASUS.</p>



<p><em>As many of you know, we introduced the first-generation ROG Ally 2-3 years ago as a market pioneer. Over the past couple of years, this new category, especially within the Windows ecosystem and creating this particular new category, has proven itself to be highly successful. We believe that we have achieved our original goals in terms of premium positioning and creating a new growth driver in the gaming segment. That is why we launched the 3rd-generation ROG Ally last month. It featured deeper collaboration with Xbox. Since its launch, we see that the market response for it has been extremely positive. Particularly, there has been an appetite for the premium higher-end models exceeding our expectations. In fact, these high-end variants are currently in short supply.</em> <em>We are working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that currently exists. Our goal for the ROG Ally is to remain a core pillar within the ASUS gaming portfolio, while also driving tangible revenue and profit growth for the company.</em></p>



<p>The CFO went on to say that the company estimates a revenue contribution from these launches to be between 3 and 5 billion New Taiwan dollars (NT$), which translates to between $96 million and $160 million. The robust demand leads ASUS to believe that this could increase slightly in future quarters to a range of between 4 and 5 billion NT$ (128-160 million US dollars).</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our review of the ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, David Carcasole praised its advanced hardware capabilities but also criticized the price tag, wondering if there was even an audience for it. Apparently, so far, it's more than enough as far as ASUS is concerned.</p>
