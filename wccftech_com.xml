			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft centric website Windows Central <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the company had paused its work on the Xbox handheld project. This did not affect the partnership with ASUS to make the ROG X Ally and ROG X Ally X, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 for a holiday release window.</p>
<p>Originally, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to use this partnership as a stopgap while it produced its own Xbox handheld that would have been released alongside the next-generation Xbox home console. These plans, however, are more than just paused - they might be practically dead now, according to The Verge's Tom Warren. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>, Warren says that Microsoft will focus on the software platform instead. Furthermore, he points out that while there will be an 'official' next-generation hardware from Microsoft, OEM partners like ASUS may also release their own versions of a next-gen Xbox console.</p>
<p>In that regard, Warren believes that the ASUS-made handhelds are a sort of 'market test' for Microsoft's increasingly tight integration of Windows and Xbox, not to mention the ambitious goal of turning every screen into an Xbox. The Verge's journalist adds that, at some point, the emulation project established by Sarah Bond in early 2024 may solve the issue. Until then, Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming are doing most of the work in helping spread the brand across devices.</p>
<p>Last year, Microsoft has made some lofty promises when it comes to the next-generation console, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming</a> that the successor of the Xbox Series X would deliver the 'largest technical leap ever seen' from one generation to another. That's certainly an ambitious goal that could possibly only be achieved through the implementation of machine learning algorithms, although we'll have to wait until Microsoft reveals its hand before assessing the veracity of that statement. The next Xbox is currently thought to be targeting a 2027 launch, presumably near the holiday season.</p>

			<p>After the news that Street Fighter 6 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 5 million units sold, CAPCOM has another sales milestone to announce this week, this time for Devil May Cry 5. The latest installment in the popular action game franchise has <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million units since its debut on March 8, 2019, for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry 5 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-2019-devil-may-cry-5-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 2 million units in less than a month, but then sales slowed down considerably. It wasn't until April 2022 that CAPCOM could <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-sold-over-5-million-units-globally-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> the five million sales milestone. Notably, sales were at 9.1 million units as of March 31, 2025, meaning the game sold almost a million units in less than three months.</p>
<p>That's a lot for a relatively old game, but it's not impossible. For one thing, there was the acclaimed Netflix Devil May Cry show that certainly helped push game sales, too. CAPCOM says that with more than 5.3 million views, it ranked fourth globally in the 'Shows | English' category during its first week. It also ranked in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan. Moreover, there was a <a href="https://x.com/DevilMayCry/status/1910766029376262605" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise sale in April</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CAPCOM is counting Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition separately. On its Platinum Titles chart, that version is listed as having sold 1 million units on its own, which means that DMC 5 as a whole has technically surpassed 11 million units.</p>
<p>DMC 5 earned high praise here on Wccftech from resident fan Francesco De Meo, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-v-devil-trigger-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> the game 9.8 out of 10:</p>
<p>Devil May Cry V is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series so far, taking everything that made Devil May Cry 3 and 4 good and bringing everything up a notch. Those who only wish to play the game through once at regular difficulty will "only" see Devil May Cry V as a very good action game that can keep them engaged from beginning to end, but veterans of the series will see it as the deep, fun and engaging game they have been waiting for over ten years.</p>
