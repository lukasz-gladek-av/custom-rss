			<p>A Chinese analyst group called XR Research Institute has claimed that the next Valve Virtual Reality headset has already entered production and will ship this year, with an estimated initial order of 400K-600K units in the first year. </p>



<p>The news has been <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by UploadVR</a> and confirmed by Valve leakers Tyler McVicker and Brad Lynch (SadlyItsBradley). The latter also <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1976141425801822419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that two VR headset models, Deckard DV1 and Deckard DV2, have appeared in the latest SteamVR beta update. According to Valve's nomenclature, DV units are supposedly the final stage of in-development hardware before retail units, which are labeled 'PV'.</p>



<p>This suggests two headsets could be coming instead of just one, or at least two SKUs. Either way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-deckard-vr-headset-rumored-to-launch-in-late-2025-at-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous rumor</a> that Valve's second Virtual Reality headset, Deckard, would launch in late 2025 seems much more likely now. That rumor pointed to a $1200 price tag, which remains unconfirmed by other leakers at this time.</p>



<p>Deckard will be Valve's second attempt with Virtual Reality following the Index, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-valve-index-vr-kit-priced-e1079-out-on-june-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in June 2019 at $999</a>. The Index also got a so-called killer application: its purchase came with a free copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-release-date-valve-index-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, the first new installment (albeit technically a prequel) in the series in a long time. Half-Life: Alyx was long considered the gold standard when it comes to triple-A Virtual Reality games, but even that was not enough to really sell consumers on the Index. As of January 2025, only 13.2% of the VR headsets connected to the Steam platform were Index devices, as revealed by the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey.</p>



<p>Has Valve prepared another new game to try and boost the sales of its upcoming Deckard VR headset? Either way, we should know soon. Brad Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1976141799560200611">seems to think</a> an official announcement could come either this month or the next one. </p>

			<p>A few (fewer than ten, at this time) former ZeniMax Online developers who worked <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the cancelled game Project Blackbird</a> and The Elder Scrolls Online have just announced <a href="https://www.sackbirdstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sackbird Studios</a>. This new Baltimore-based indie developer was inspired by the cancellation of Project Blackbird to build a studio that avoids the pitfalls experienced across the industry.</p>



<p>Lee Ridout, Chief Executive Officer at Sackbird Studios, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’re grateful for our time at ZeniMax Online Studios; it shaped us as developers and as people. When I learned that Blackbird was being cancelled and a lot of people were losing their jobs, it lit a fire. We realized the best way to protect our craft—and our team—was to create a studio where creative independence isn’t negotiable.</em></p>



<p>David Worley, Chief Operating Officer at Sackbird Studios, added:</p>



<p><em>After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets. We’re fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games.</em></p>



<p>Sackbird Studios has already started working on an original project for PC and consoles, though, of course, this is way too early to discuss it. The only hint was shared on LinkedIn, where the studio suggested that its mandate is to 'create unforgettable multiplayer experiences that surprise and thrill players'.</p>



<p>Still, we'll monitor the studio's progress over the years. Stay tuned.</p>
