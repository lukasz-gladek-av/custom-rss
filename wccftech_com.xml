			<p>Renowned leaker Tom Henderson shared an interesting tidbit regarding Kratos and the next God of War game in the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFFHG7oPngE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming's weekly podcast</a>. </p>



<p>Henderson was discussing with the others the likelihood that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off</a> would be announced at the next State of Play (rumored to take place before the end of September). The leaker then remarked that Sony Santa Monica is also working on a new mainline entry, adding that Kratos would be equipped with a brand new weapon from ancient Egypt.</p>



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There's some weird confusion because there is the Metroidvania game in development and then there's also a new mainline God of War game in development, which is kind of similar in themes. I think that Kratos this time has an Egyptian sword, you know, like the curved Egyptian sword. I can't remember what they are called, but I think like what Prince of Persia's got or whatever.</em></p>



<p>Henderson appears to be referring to the Khopesh, a sickle-shaped sword that evolved in Egypt from battle axes. It would be a new weapon for Kratos, but more to the point, it would indirectly imply a potential Egyptian setting. After all, why would there be an Egyptian sword if that wasn't the case? The Norse duology added fitting weapons like the Leviathan Axe, a weapon historically favored by nordic warriors.</p>



<p>It's not first time that the Egyptian setting has been attached to God of War. Before the release of the 2018 installment, Game Director Cory Barlog said that, after the Norse saga, future games could feature either Egyptian or Mayan mythology. </p>



<p>It's already been three years since the release of Ragnarök. However, if the rumor about the smaller Metroidvania game is correct, chances are the next big main installment is a bit further away. Still, in the meantime, fans have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video adaptation</a> to look forward to. The first season is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start filming in March 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Would you like for Sony Santa Monica to choose Egypt as the next God of War setting?</p>

			<p>New details about the upcoming Resident Evil film are starting to pour in. Just a few days ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-bird-star-joins-zach-creggar-resident-evil-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that actor Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai, Black Bird, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, The Naked Gun) would join the cast. Now, movie director Zach Cregger (Barbarian, Weapons) <a href="https://ew.com/resident-evil-movie-entirely-original-story-set-game-world-zach-cregger-exclusive-11812968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has spoken with Entertainment Weekly</a> about the adaptation, revealing that it will be an entirely original story and, despite fan speculation, Leon Kennedy from the games won't be there.</p>



<p><em>It's an entirely original story. When you watch it, you'll be like, 'This is very Zach.' It's just it takes place in the Resident Evil world. I don't think fans of the games are gonna be bummed. I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous. But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna like tell a Resident Evil story in the Resident Evil canon that still leaves everything they love intact from the games, you know what I mean?</em></p>



<p><em>I think that when you see it, you'll understand how I can be obsessed with original ideas and still make a movie that is an IP-based thing. I know that doesn't make a lot of sense now, but I hope that it will later.</em></p>



<p>We only know the very basics of this original story based on the synopsis. Apparently, a 'hapless courier' is sent to deliver a package to a remote hospital and soon finds himself caught in the middle of an outbreak and must battle hordes of mutated creatures to survive. The courier is probably going to be played by Austin Abrams, who was the first actor to be confirmed for the Resident Evil movie. Abrams has been featured in This Is Us, Euphoria, Wolfs, and Weapons.</p>



<p>This will be the third film saga based on CAPCOM's survival horror IP. The first and most famous is the series of six movies directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, starring Milla Jovovich. In 2021, there was an attempted reboot with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city-director-says-the-most-challenging-part-was-living-up-to-zombie-movies-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</a>, which was more faithful than Anderson's movies to the games but still largely failed to captivate critics and fans. The following year, a way less faithful TV series adaptation was released on Netflix; it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-tv-series-canceled-by-netflix-after-one-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> after the first season.</p>



<p>Cregger's new Resident Evil film will debut in theaters on September 18, 2026. Meanwhile, a brand new game installment, Requiem, will be released on February 27, 2026. You can find our Gamescom 2025 hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
