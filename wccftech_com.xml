			<p>Today, Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-march-dragon-age-the-veilguard-sonic-colors-ultimate-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the PS Plus lineup for the month of March, and the highlight is undoubtedly Dragon Age: The Veilguard. BioWare's game launched only four months ago. It is rare that a triple-A game of this importance joins a subscription service like PS Plus (or Xbox Game Pass) this early after the release.</p>
<p>However, as reported in previous coverage, the game didn't sell nearly as well as the publisher had hoped. By the end of 2024, it had sold 1.5 million copies, about half of what Electronic Arts had estimated before launch. That is despite positive critic reviews, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including mine</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPG with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>The underwhelming commercial performance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard definitely played a factor in EA's decision to sign a deal with Sony. BioWare itself was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to some layoffs and other people were reassigned to different studios within EA</a>. As a result, the studio now has less than a hundred employees, though the plan is still to go forward with the new Mass Effect project.</p>
<p>Besides Dragon Age: The Veilguard, PlayStation Plus subscribers will also get the following games in March:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-colors-ultimate-new-sonic-team-game-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> (PlayStation 4)</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a> (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5)</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of the games will be available for PS Plus subscribers to download and add to their collection between March 4 and March 31.</p>
