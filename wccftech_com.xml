			<p>Techland has been working up to the third mainline installment in the series for the last few years since the launch of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/">after a late delay</a>, followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/">release date being moved forward</a>, Dying Light: The Beast is officially out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>A new launch trailer premiered alongside the game going live on all platforms, showing even more gameplay off and giving players a recap on how they'll find returning protagonist Kyle Crane at the beginning of The Beast's story.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Techland has also confirmed that the game is Steam Deck verified, so players can take their parkouring adventure on the go with them if they want. Rendering and audio director at Techland, Tomasz Szałkowski, said that he was "<em>personally driven</em>" to ensure that the game would run on Steam Deck, overseeing the creation of a special performance mode "<em>that contains a mix of tweaked settings and special optimizations together with HDR and VRR running smoothly on an OLED display.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Dying Light is back, and I couldn't be more proud of my team and the game we created</em>," said Paweł Marchewka, Techland's chief executive officer in a press release. "<em>Their passion, dedication, and hard work have resulted in something truly great. This project taught us more than any before about the importance of staying true to the core elements of our IP. For players, it's an exciting return to the roots of the series, and for us, we're back on the right track!</em>"</p>



<p>Franchise director Tymon Smektała added, "<em>Dying Light: The Beast is our love letter to the series and to the incredible Dying Light community. Our players have stood with us through highs and lows, and our greatest ambition with this project was to deliver the game that our community truly deserves. To all the fans of Kyle Crane and Dying Light, the moment is here. It's time to unleash The Beast!</em>"</p>



<p>I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">reviewed</a> Dying Light: The Beast for Wccftech, and while its tried-and-true approach to combat and parkour mechanics delivers an undeniably fun time, the overall package of the game was lacking in anything more substantial.</p>



<p>You can check out my full review for more details, and what led me to feeling that, "<em>Overall, those two pillars only keep the game interesting for as long as you want to keep your brain turned off. A dash of well-executed survival elements around those pillars doesn't make up for the rest of the ways the game is lacking, making Dying Light: The Beast a missable title as we move into the final months of 2025 with plenty of major releases on the horizon.</em>"</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will introduce significant improvements over the original PlayStation release and the Nintendo 3DS remake to deliver a much better experience.</p>



<p>These improvements are shown off with a new batch of screenshots which provide a new look at the game's 3D art style reminiscent of miniature figurines, the environments and dungeons brought to life with hand-crafted diorama-style aesthetics, a redesigned UI with a tab-based menu system for easy navigation, and plenty of side content, which includes a battle arena, the classic Lucky Panel minigame and more. The battle system, in particular, seems to have undergone the most significant changes, as the remake will feature more dynamic and thrilling battles with the evolution of the party moveset and monsters' appearances and behaviors, the ability to defeat weak foes without getting into battle by attacking them on the field, and more. Character customization also promises to be one of the highlights of the experience once again, thanks to the Vocation system which allows characters to change their own after a certain point in the story, and Moonlighting, which allows characters to have two Vocations at once.</p>
