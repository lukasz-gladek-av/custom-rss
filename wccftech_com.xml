			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunning The Witcher 4 demo</a> shown during the State of Unreal presentation earlier this month, Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia had the unique opportunity to fly to Poland and meet CD Projekt RED (and Epic) to discuss what went into the demo and what kind of work the studio has ahead of itself for the full game.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy interview</a>, Charles Tremblay, VP of Technology at CD Projekt RED, revealed that the team switched to a console-first approach to development to achieve its ambitious goal of delivering an open world game with hardware ray tracing running at 60 frames per second on a Sony PlayStation 5 console. This will be easier than scaling down, which the studio had to do with their previous projects.</p>
<p><em>When we started the collaboration, we had super high ambitions for this project. We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down, but then we had so many problems in the past that we</em><br>
<em>tried to see, okay, this time around we really want to be more of a console first development. Then we worked with Unreal and we saw the challenge to realize the ambition that to make what we want, 60 fps on PS5, there would be work. This is why we started to talk, to figure out what needs to be done with the technology and we also decided, okay, we need to have all those things that need to be developed. Where we go from there, it's hard to say, but right now we really wanted to focus on what does it mean to make this ambition on a console. We&nbsp;really wanted to aim for 60 fps and not go back to 30 fps.</em></p>
<p><em>At this stage, we are perfectly aware that we still have a lot of work ahead of us. This is a tech demo, not the whole gameplay loop is implemented, there's no combat, there's a lot of things that don't work, but still, the ambition is set, so this is where we want to aim for The Witcher 4. It's too early to say if we manage to nail it, but we'll work as hard as we can to make it for sure.</em></p>
<p>The PS5 is not, however, the lowest of current-generation consoles when it comes to hardware performance. There's the Xbox Series S, and Tremblay admitted that the developers haven't begun to optimize The Witcher 4 for it yet, adding that it will be 'extremely challenging' to get it to run at 60 fps.</p>
<p><em>I wish we did a lot of work already on that, but we did not, so this is something that is next on our radar for sure. I will say that 60 FPS will definitely be extremely challenging on Xbox Series S. Let's just say that this is something that we need to figure out.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Epic considers software Lumen ray tracing to be a thing of the past due to several limitations, which is why the demo created for The Witcher 4 already implements hardware RT Lumen. CD Projekt RED, on the other hand, mentioned that they'll want to scale up for a high-end PC, although the form that scaling will take remains to be seen at this point.</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 will likely be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2027 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Stay tuned to Wccftech for the latest rumors and reveals.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is practically indestructible, at least according to YouTuber JerryRigEverything, who<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9jEYO2oaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> took it upon himself</a> to smash it 50 times with pliers and noticed it still worked. The YouTuber even removed the external plastic layer before attempting this test, which means in reality it's going to be even more resistant to hits of any kind.</p>
<p>Here's the quote from his video:</p>
<p><em>We did remove the plastic screen protector from earlier, and the only way to truly tell if the Nintendo Switch 2 screen is going to scatter into bits if we shatter it is if we shatter it! After 13 hits, the Joy-Cons pop off, and I'm starting to think there isn't any glass and the whole thing is shatterproof plastic. Another 14 very solid hits, and the Switch 2 is shockingly still alive.&nbsp; 15 more and still nothing! This is wild. If watching this doesn't give you confidence&nbsp; in the Switch 2's durability, nothing will. Only after 50 hits from my ridiculously large&nbsp; pliers do we see that indeed there is a thin layer of glass on the surface, and as you can see from the slow motion, Nintendo was right and it does indeed explode into little needle-like shards of glass without that laminate top layer. So I would definitely leave yours intact and in place. Most of the glass is still glued to the LCD, but there are still plenty of free shards of pulverized glass and dust that could embed themselves into little kids' fingers or eyeballs, so I'm glad that Nintendo has a top layer and nobody should take it off. Even though I did get a black screen of death, after a quick reset, Nintendo says it was just kidding about being game over and is ready to keep on playing. Basically invincible. I'm a big fan of the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 screen is a 7.9 inch (20 cm) edge-lit LCD touchscreen with 1080p resolution (279 ppi), <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-SYNC powered</a> variable refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, and HDR support (albeit <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre</a> due to the display's low peak brightness).</p>
<p>The console is literally flying off the shelves, having <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> Nintendo's previous record with over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days on the market, roughly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice as fast</a> as the original Switch had sold in the same timeframe.
