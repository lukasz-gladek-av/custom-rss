			<p>When Red Dead Redemption launched on PC on October 29, the author of the Reality Redemption overhaul mod, BadassBaboon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they would soon port it for this version. The mod was originally made for the Xbox 360 version (<a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-xenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which could run on PC via Xenia</a>) and the Nintendo Switch version of the game. However, the modder encountered an issue running the game on his configuration. In the meantime, other modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> providing texture mods for specific areas, like grass, particles, and the protagonist himself.</p>
<p>Now, though, BadassBaboon has resolved their issue with launching the game (they had to roll back to an earlier version of Windows 11, for some reason), and Reality Redemption for PC can be downloaded here. It's by far the most comprehensive improvement mod for Rockstar's open world masterpiece. Here's a list of its current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase memory pools and improve general performance</li>
<li>Improve reflection quality</li>
<li>Improve draw distance for vegetation</li>
<li>Improve draw distance for the map</li>
<li>Improve particles and particle count</li>
<li>Improve debris variation and count</li>
<li>Improve physics for liquids like water</li>
<li>Improve AI behavior</li>
<li>Improve the game camera to behave more like RDR2</li>
<li>Improve the Euphoria physics</li>
<li>Improve random events spawn and spawn rate</li>
<li>Improve materials and their interactivity</li>
<li>Improve culling</li>
<li>Modify the movement animations for smoother transitions</li>
<li>Improve John Marston textures</li>
<li>Improve game world textures such as trails, roads, grounds, and grass</li>
<li>Fix the nighttime broken fog and other time cycle shortcomings</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see in the video below, the improvement is significant, and that's even with only 2K textures. I spoke to BadassBaboon about trying to push textures to 4K and they said they'll try.</p>

<p>Beyond a potential texture upscale to 4K, there are also several Reality Redemption features that have to be finished or implemented, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve secondary character textures and building textures</li>
<li>Improve tree textures and smaller physics-based props</li>
<li>Improve cloud skyhats</li>
<li>Improve vehicle draw distance</li>
<li>Improve the shadow maps and shadow distance</li>
<li>Improve sky lighting and time cycles</li>
<li>Improve weather and cloud variations and improve the overall weather system</li>
<li>Improve cloud shadows</li>
<li>Add an option to disable rainy weather at Thieves Landing</li>
<li>Fix the moonlight ground overbright issue</li>
<li>Improve rain effects</li>
<li>Figure out why R* didn't implement a proper PostFX system in this game</li>
<li>Increase some memory allocations</li>
<li>Update the game's lore with new dialogue and subtitles</li>
<li>Improved weapon and environment sounds</li>
<li>Add new and improved particle and effect textures</li>
</ul>
