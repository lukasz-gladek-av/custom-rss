			<p>FromSoftware has elected to postpone the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-coming-next-week/">Elden Ring Nightreign update 1.02</a>, which would have added the highly-requested duos mode to the game, due to tsunami warnings following a major earthquake on Russia's coast. An earthquake that hit the Kamchatka Peninsula off the coast of Russia earlier Wednesday morning has sent tsunami waves towards Russia, Japan, and Hawaii, with each region on alert. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/climate-and-environment/article/88-magnitude-earthquake-sends-tsunami-into-coasts-of-russia-japan-and-hawaii/">CTV News</a>, the earthquake was one of the strongest ever recorded at an 8.8 magnitude, and sent at least one tsunami wave of up to 13 feet to the shore of Japan's northern island of Hokkaido. Though it's been several hours since the initial earthquake, Japan has kept its northern regions at high alert, while the alert has been lowered to an advisory in its more southern regions.</p>



<p>"<em>Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula, we have decided to postpone the distribution of the 'ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN' Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST | 1:00 PDT</em>,<em>"</em> FromSoftware wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415325264031884">post on X</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Additionally, the second cycle of Everdark Sovereign, which was scheduled to start at 03:00 CEST | 18:00 PDT (7/30) tomorrow, will also be delayed until after the update file has been distributed.</em> <em>Thank you for understanding</em>."</p>

<p>While players who are looking forward to the update might be upset to learn that they'll have to wait a little longer to play Nightreign in an official duos mode, a tsunami is a more than reasonable reason to delay anything. Hopefully, the warnings and alerts pass with the waves causing minimal or better yet, no damage, and no one is hurt. We'll update you when FromSoftware confirms the new release window for the update.</p>
