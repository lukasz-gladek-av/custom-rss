			<p>Astrolabe Interactive announced that the studio's co-op sandbox survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/aloft-by-astrolabe-interactive-scheduled-to-launch-into-early-access-on-january-15th/">Aloft</a> has surpassed 200,000 copies sold in early access since its launch in January 2025.</p>
<p>Astrolabe has partnered with <a href="https://www.coolearth.org/act-now/stream-for-cool-earth/">Cool Earth</a> to celebrate the milestone and will donate 5% of the revenue it earned during the Earth Appreciation Festival on Steam to the Cool Earth Initiative. Astrolabe and Cool Earth are also working with content creators and streamers to stream Aloft today, livestreaming the game in charity streams, and the proceeds will also go to the Cool Earth Initiative.</p>
<p>Cool Earth is an organization working to protect the world's rainforests and support the indigenous peoples who have been living and working with them, instead of against them, for generations.</p>
<p>In a press release, Astrolabe's creative director, Manuel Bergeron, discussed how Cool Earth's work and Earth Day directly relate to what Astrolabe wanted players to learn when playing Aloft.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">One of our goals in Aloft was to offer a chance for players to learn about the fragile balance of ecosystems and have a direct positive impact on their environment</span>. <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">It's our honor to contribute to the environment by giving to the Cool Earth Initiative.</span></em>"</p>
<p>Aloft's first major update in early access, Critters and Wonders, launched this past March. According to the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/543345713449272665?l=english">roadmap</a> for 2025, more major content updates and plenty of feature improvements are planned for the year, though specific release dates or windows around when that'll be have yet to be announced.</p>
