			<p>GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, and the long wait for its release is reportedly going to be well worth it, as other games will require decades to match some of the things Rockstar Games is doing for its game.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz">Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly</a>, who proved in the past to have solid sources for Rockstar news, replied to a fan's question asking about GTA 6 potentially being just a GTA V 2.0. This isn't going to be the case, according to Reilly, as some of the stuff Rockstar Games is doing with GTA 6 is extremely ambitious and will likely be unmatched for almost two decades, as developers may require 15/20 years to do the same things the Grand Theft Auto developer is doing for the next entry in the series.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>lol it definitely isn't GTA V 2.0 and people have no idea what they are talking about.</p><p>Some of the stuff I have heard Rockstar are doing with GTA 6 is super ambitious and it is unlikely any other developer will be able to match what they are doing for 15-20+ years.</p></div>— Reece “Kiwi Talkz” Reilly (@kiwitalkz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kiwitalkz/status/1989106189830168934?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although this statement may sound hyperbolic, there's likely some truth to what Kiwi Talks has heard. <span>While we have seen very little of the game in action, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-patents-revolutionize-open-world-forever/">patents and leaks</a> have highlighted how&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-advanced-ai-dynamic-environments/" target="_blank">GTA 6 is attempting to push the franchise and the open-world genre as a whole forward</a>&nbsp;with some impressive advanced features.</span> </p>



<p>The NPC AI features, in particular, sound extremely interesting, as human NPCs are reportedly going to feature an AIMemory system that will allow them to remember players' actions and decisions, influencing their interactions. Reportedly, NPCs will also be able to smell the player and other NPCs, which is definitely an unusual feature, but one that could further improve immersion, as will dynamic environments, which will be influenced not only by story progression, but also by players' actions.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it will be some time before fans can finally get their hands on GTA 6 to check out these features for themselves. The official release window for the sixth entry in the series has been the subject of several announcements, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">moving from an initial target of Fall 2025 to May 2026</a>, and then being <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">officially adjusted once more to November 2026.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/soulframe-to-open-founders-program-on-november-25-2025.1355440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During the monthly Soulframe developer stream, Canadian developer Digital Extremes announced that the <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/founders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Founders program</a> will go live on Tuesday, November 25, 2025, coinciding with the twelfth <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-preludes-opens-public-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preludes</a> (Pre-Alpha) update to the game.</p>



<p>Geoff Crookes, Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Founders is the next major step for Soulframe, welcoming anyone to join us in building something truly special. During our Pre-Alpha period, Preludes, we’ve built upon new ideas entirely from scratch and begun to craft a meaningful, strong foundation for a world that offers something important missing from our everyday lives: hope. Soulframe is meant to become a home for redemption, while feeling grounded and patient for everyone who plants their roots here. For those who have long wished to support Soulframe from its roots, this is an invitation to do so from the beginning.</em></p>



<p>Fans will be able to pick between four Founders paths that embody the Virtues of Courage, Spirit, and Grace. There's the path of the brave fighter (Wyld Tethren), willpowered mage (Wyld Oscelda), and rogueish archer (Wyld Sirin). These options are outfitted with an exclusive character Wyld Pact, main weapon and sidearm, armour set, talisman, dye Hues, bird cosmetics, Arcs (premium currency), two extra Preludes invite codes, among other benefits like the “Envoy's Sphere Sword Skin” for use in Warframe.</p>



<p>The ultimate option, the Paragon, includes all the benefits of other Founders' paths in addition to an exclusive Paragon Greatsword and an additional allotment of Arcs (premium currency), Armor Bestitching items, and 10 Preludes invite codes. Lastly, Founders will be able to etch their names in the Eternium Garden, planting their exclusive Founder flora and thus leaving a lasting mark in Soulframe.</p>



<p>The new Preludes update adds a new weapon grip type, and significantly overhauls the onboarding process of new players. When starting the game, they can now discover Grandfa's Hut and test all three starting Pacts there before committing to a Pact and Enclave. Exploration is also going to be a bit easier thanks to clearer marker placements for essential destinations, as well as fast travel with Wevetseeds.</p>



<p>A new elixir called The Cogah can be discovered. Drinking it triggers the ability to challenge the Agari overworld bosses roaming the overworld to a more difficult fight, thus unlocking new rewards. Finally, Digital Extremes is adding new Totems and Runes that can be used to specialize weapon types further.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the near future, players can expect a new mission type called Siege Encounters, which will take place at various enemy-filled forts. The Envoys must force out the Ode occupation, take down sub-bosses waiting within, and bring down the balloon laying claim to the territory. After the completion of a Siege Encounter, the new infamy rating system will be affected depending on how the mission is approached, persisting with the player into the following Siege. </p>



<p>Lastly, Jennifer English (Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3, Latenna in Elden Ring, and Maelle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33) will be joining the Soulframe cast soon as a new character, Alora, the Empress of Eldveil.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bloodborne has now become even more playable on a wider range of PC configurations thanks to the latest version of the ShadPS4 emulator, now available for download.</p>



<p>Version 0.12.6 of the emulator developed initially by George Moralis, which can now be downloaded as a nightly build <a href="https://shadps4.net/downloads/">using the installer found on the emulator's official website</a>, packs some performance and emulation improvements for select PlayStation 4 exclusives that have yet to officially launch on PC, such as the aforementioned Bloodborne and God of War III Remastered.</p>



<p>FromSoftware's hardcore action role-playing game seems to have benefited the most from the improvements made to the emulator's latest build. As shown in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru">Tabeneru</a>, the game's performance on an Intel Core i5-13500 CPU and RTX 3060 Ti GPU is doubled in some instances over the previous version of the emulator.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SHADPS4 v0.12.6 WIP ~ Bloodborne (MASSIVE PERFORMANCE BOOST) | PS4 Emulation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mizWp1zwzr0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the game runs almost flawlessly on an RTX 4080 with none of the frame pacing issues that plague it on PlayStation 5, as shown in another video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam.</a></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ShadPS4 Progress,  v0.12.6 WIP, Bloodborne Big Performance boost" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hf9Drkm7QVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This is great news for most players, but especially for those with mid or low end hardware, as these improvements make it possible for such users to enjoy the game without performance issues, although issues still present (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">some fixable with mods</a>) prevent the game from being perfectly emulated. Still, Steam Deck users can similarly benefit from these improvements, as Bloodborne now runs much better on the handheld system, as showcased in a new video by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>God of War III Remastered, on the other hand, is still not entirely playable due to evident visual glitches in multiple stages, but now the game's epic intro sequence is perfectly emulated, which bodes for the rest of the game getting properly emulated with improved performance down the line. You can check out how the game runs on ShadPS4 0.12.6 in the video below shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alepc7480">Ale PC</a> on YouTube.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new ShadPS4 0.12.6 version also introduces significant performance improvements in other PlayStation 4 exclusives, such as InFAMOUS Second Son, which is sadly still far from being playable, The Last Guardian, and others. You can check out how these games run on the latest version of the emulator in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMESMARKING">GAMESMARK</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GreedFall 2: The Dying World Gets Largest Early Access Update to Date]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-gets-largest-early-access-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-gets-largest-early-access-update-to-date.1355395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, French developer Spiders has announced that its roleplaying game GreedFall 2: The Dying World received the second major update, and the largest yet, since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-launches-this-summer-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut on Steam Early Access</a>.</p>



<p>To begin with, the developers are introducing Peren, a new, explorable city and region after Olima. Once the capital of the Astrian civilization, it is now ruled by the Merchant Congregation. The city is currently affected by the Malichor epidemic, a mysterious plague rampaging through the whole continent of Gacane. Players will have to be mindful of the many political intrigues they'll find while exploring Peren.</p>



<p>The update also adds a new companion, Till. That will come as a bit of a surprise to those who played the game, as earlier in the story, he was responsible for capturing the player character and forcing them to abandon their native island of Teer Fradee. Till, a former captain of the renowned Coin Guard mercenary guild, now seeks redemption and offers his help to the player. Personality-wise, players will find him to be quiet and gruff. In gameplay terms, he's essentially a tank equipped with heavy armor and a two-handed sword.</p>



<p>Combat was one of the most criticized aspects of GreedFall 2: The Dying World when it first launched on early access, and Spiders is now overhauling it. There are now three different modes that players can select:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical - Maximum control of the battlefield and camera management. Usage of the tactical pause is emphasized.</li>



<li>Focused - Direct action is emphasized, and the AI manages companions. Limited tactical pausing is available.</li>



<li>Hybrid - Balances manual and AI control and offers moderate tactical pause/camera management.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are also three difficulty settings: Tactical mode, Adventure mode, and Story mode.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Additionally, this update introduces new side quests and events, improves the crafting system, overhauls the character creation tool, implements Photo Mode, and adds various “quality of life” improvements and optimizations. If you'd like to check out the new stuff without replaying the initial content, the developers are even offering some ready-to-use save files. More info can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/525357766327405696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on this page</a>.</p>



<p>GreedFall 2: The Dying World has a generic 2026 launch window for version 1.0 (and the console debuts). We'll let you know once the studio narrows it down to a specific date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive and Games Workshop surprised many by <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</a> just about six months after the launch of Space Marine 2. It seemed a bit too early, especially with a game that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling gangbusters</a> and would get a lot of post-launch support.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-and-space-marine-3-are-definitely-not-competing-for-resources-dev-insists-while-remaining-coy-about-necrons-in-the-sequel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by IGN</a>, in a recent new episode of <a href="https://warhammertv.com/details/31550?playlist_id=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer TV's Deep Strike show</a> (only available to Warhammer Plus subscribers), Creative Director Oliver Hollis-Leick explained that it's not at all an issue for the development team, and the two projects won't be competing for resources.</p>



<p><em>Announcing a third game doesn’t in any way mean that we’re not going to continue creating content for the existing game. The thing is, the development cycles for these projects are long. For Space Marine 2, it was something like four years. And so, for Space Marine 3, it’s going to be the same.</em></p>



<p><em>We announced it to, in one way, keep people aware of the fact we’re going to continue this, that there’s going to be more coming. But we’re also doing the same thing with DLC. There’s lots already been created and there’s lots more to come. They’re definitely not competing for resources.</em></p>



<p>Saber Interactive has <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously confirmed</a> the following Space Marine 2 content roadmap for 2026:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two new PvE missions</li>



<li>Techmarine class</li>



<li>Techmarine weapon (Omnissiah Axe)</li>



<li>Battle-barge expansion</li>



<li>Stratagems (new battlefield conditions and rewards)</li>



<li>Progression update</li>



<li>New Terminus enemy</li>



<li>Two new PvP arenas</li>



<li>PvP Stratagems</li>



<li>New siege map</li>
</ul>



<p>In the Warhammer TV interview, Hollis-Leick also answered questions about that Necron tease toward the end of Space Marine 2:</p>



<p><em>One of the things about this universe is it’s vast. It’s almost timeless. And so if you go digging deep down below the surface of a planet, you could find all kinds of things. And so finding what appears to be a Necron tomb, or at least Necron technology below the surface of a world, is not an outrageous thing to happen. But also in the narrative, they’re dealing with what seems to be Blackstone-like technology, although it’s never expressly stated. And so that directly links to the Necrons. As to whether we’ll see any more of them, that I cannot say. But it certainly was a nice thing to see at the end of the game there.</em></p>



<p>Oliver Hollis-Leick appeared to confirm that Saber Interactive is looking at a four-year development schedule for Space Marine 3, meaning we could see the game in late 2028, provided there are no delays.</p>
