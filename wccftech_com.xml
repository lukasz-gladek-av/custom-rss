			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision is rumored to launch in Europe before the end of the month, retaining the price of the currently available model.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-version-de-la-ps5-pro-arriverait-bientot-voici-ce-que-lon-croit-en-savoir-60579">Dealabs</a> by billbil-kun, who has proven time and time again to be extremely reliable regarding new video games and hardware launches, it is claimed that a new hardware CFI-7121 hardware revision discovered via Japanese certification documents is in the works and set to be launched in Europe on September 30. The changes to this new hardware revision are expected to be limited to better energy efficiency, so there won't be any change to the console's design nor to the system's SSD capacity, which will remain at 2 TB as in the current model. It is also claimed the new hardware revision system will retain the current €799.99 price tag. A launch in North America is uncertain at the time.</p>



<p>Although the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision has yet to be confirmed officially, given billbil-kun's excellent track record and the listing of the new revision in the same certification documents that confirmed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-digital-edition-hardware-revision-smaller-ssd-price/">existance of the base model Digital Edition CFI-2000 revision</a>, which indeed launched in Europe this week, there's a high probability the system is indeed launching in the region in a few days. </p>



<p>This time around, however, there should be no need to rush to purchase the current PS5 Pro model, as storage will not be reduced as a not-so-subtle way to avoid raising the system's price, which is already high compared to every other current-generation system.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has plenty to offer over the base PlayStation 5 models, including support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">improve next year</a>.

			<p>During Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQMxcCpkI44">Metal Gear Production Hotline presentation</a> at Tokyo Game Show 2025, we finally got a release date for the Fox Hunt multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, which is due to arrive on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/">multiplayer mode was first debuted back in June 2025</a>, ahead of Metal Gear Solid Delta's launch this past August. Before its announcement, it wasn't clear if there would be a multiplayer mode in the remake like what was previously included in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. When it was revealed, it became clear that the answer to that question was still no; there wasn't going to be a multiplayer mode like what players had in MGS3.</p>



<p>Fox Hunt is markedly different than the old multiplayer mode, a change that, per what Konami said when it was first revealed, came out of a desire to "<em></em><em>broadens the franchise’s core stealth element where players must utilize their environments to camouflage and evade opposing players</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Granted, it doesn't look like it's a bad change. The mode seems like it'll take good advantage of the stealth mechanics available in Metal Gear Solid Delta. What's perhaps most unfortunate about the coming mode, is that just ahead of MGSD: Snake Eater's launch, Konami <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/">confirmed it would not include support for crossplay.</a> </p>



<p>We'll see if that changes in the future, potentially if players continue to ask for it to be added. In the meantime, at least we have a date to look forward to for when we can all try out Fox Hunt.</p>



<p>In other Metal Gear Solid news, Konami put out a survey for Tokyo Game Show 2025 asking players <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-wants-to-know-which-metal-gear-solid-game-you-think-should-be-remade/">which MGS game they thing should get the remake treatment that MGS3 got with Delta</a>. </p>
