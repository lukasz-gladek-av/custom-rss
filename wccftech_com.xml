			<p>It's been a while since Sony decided to bring practically all of its PlayStation exclusive games to PC, albeit after some time. The 'multiplatform' strategy has done wonders for its bottom line, and Hiroki Totoki, now CEO of Sony Group Corporation, openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-wants-to-improve-operating-profit-with-a-more-aggressive-pc-first-party-games-release-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a> about aggressively pursuing that plan to improve the company's operating profit even further.</p>



<p>Going full-fledged multiplatform like Microsoft did for its Xbox division seemed practically taboo, though. Sure, there was the oddity of MLB The Show, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/mlb-the-show-21-xbox-game-pass-day-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added an Xbox version starting in 2021</a>. However, that was more due to the license holder's will than Sony's. </p>



<p>More interesting was the recent decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series S and X</a> in exactly one month from today. Sure, it is a live service game and therefore inherently benefits from a larger player base, and it is particularly well-suited to Xbox, being a sci-fi shooter. </p>



<p>Might this be just the proverbial tip of the iceberg? A new job listing spotted online suggests that it could indeed be the case. Sony is <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5587289004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking</a> for a Senior Director of Multiplatform &amp; Account Management who will '<em>play a critical leadership role in shaping and executing the global commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile. This role is accountable for optimizing title profitability, ensuring cross-functional alignment, and leading a high-performing team focused on multiplatform expansion, mid-range commercial planning, and platform partner management</em>.'</p>



<p>It might be that Sony is finally coming to Microsoft's same realization: with budgets ever on the rise and triple-A development taking longer and longer, arbitrarily cutting potential revenue sources just doesn't make as much sense as it has throughout the gaming industry's history.</p>



<p>I, for one, would very much welcome a fully multiplatform future. Ideally, Nintendo would join too at some point, although that might not be for a while - after all, they are known for doing their own thing.</p>
