			<p>Sandfall Interactive has a much bigger success on their hands than they could have predicted with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, so naturally, players who have already gorged themselves on the game since its launch are hoping to hear that there's more to come from the studio.</p>
<p>Which there very well could be, as lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen hints to fans in a conversation on Instagram (spotted by <a href="https://n4g.com/articles/playstation-chances-for-clair-obscure-expedition-33-dlc-are-good-says-lead-writer/">N4G</a>) that the chances are "<em>good</em>" that the team at Sandfall will begin working on DLC, or at least "<em>something more</em>" from the world of Clair Obscur.</p>
<p>"<em>Nothing concrete that I can say at the moment, we're honestly still just trying to process everything that's happening. It's been a lot to take in!</em>" Svedberg-Yen began when trying to answer the question of whether DLC for Clair Obscur is incoming.</p>
<p>"<em>We've always said if there is strong desire from the players that we would love to do something more, and based on the responses so far, I'd say chances are good</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>It's not by any means a definitive answer, but it does point in the right direction for fans of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And as Svedberg-Yen points out, the team is still just taking everything in at the moment. If there will be DLC incoming, it'll be a while before it's ready to be shown. The new RPG has been a hit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-surpasses-500k-copies-sold-at-launch/">surpassing half a million</a> copies sold during its launch day and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">then exceeding the one million mark</a> over its launch weekend.</p>
<p>Which is an even bigger feat when you consider that it entered the market as a brand-new series, just days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> was released. Both titles were available on Xbox Game Pass, and still, Clair Obscur reached the one million milestone of copies sold in such a short amount of time, not just <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/">player engagement</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tejo-valorants-newest-agent-has-been-revealed/">Valorant</a> is set to celebrate its five-year anniversary on June 2, 2025, which is why a key focus to Act III will be celebrating the game's biggest moments in the last five years.</p>
<p>Act III and the new battle pass will be live tomorrow, April 30, 2025, featuring a special series of anniversary cards that are meant to highlight Valorant's history, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Duelists Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Cypher's Revenge Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Can't Slow Me Down Card</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Riot's lead for Valorant, <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Anna Donlon</a>, spoke about the changes the game has gone through in the last five years and the state of the world when Riot first started to launch Valorant and get players into the game.</p>
<p>She also talked about how the Valorant team at Riot is working to fix some of the longstanding issues the game has faced in the last five years, and that more information regarding those fixes will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if those fixes result in any major changes for the game. Some live service games, like Apex Legends, have been through tumultuous changes in recent years as Respawn has tried to satisfy a player base that was growing increasingly unsatisfied with the state of the game. Those same big swings might not happen here, but the potential is there, as Donlon specifically calls out balancing abilities, which could have a huge impact for a hero shooter.</p>
