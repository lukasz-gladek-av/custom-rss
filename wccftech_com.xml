			<p>Beyond the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/">laid-off</a> employees, a number of former <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> developers at BioWare are now said to be allocated "permanently" to other projects by EA, a shocking move for the employees involved.</p>
<p>The report comes from Jason Schreier (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">via Bloomberg</a>), who says that BioWare initially claimed that the employees were meant for a temporary transfer, but later on, EA decided to make this permanent without informing the individuals involved.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>But this week, the group was informed that the loans had morphed into permanent relocations, according to people familiar with what happened. They were no longer BioWare employees who were temporarily on assignment elsewhere; now, they worked for whichever EA subsidiary had borrowed them.&nbsp; </em><em>If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply.</em></p>
<p><em>- Bloomberg</em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">This is a pretty interesting development, considering that BioWare already suffered a round of layoffs last year. According to Bloomberg, BioWare now has less than 100 employees, which is certainly a lot less than you'd expect from a triple-A studio. In a statement from EA to IGN, the publisher provided a vague response:</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>The studio's priority was Dragon Age. During this time there were people continuing to build the vision for the next Mass Effect. Now that The Veilguard has shipped, the studio's full focus is Mass Effect. While we're not sharing numbers, the studio has the right number of people in the right roles to work on Mass Effect at this stage of development</em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>- EA via <a href="https://pk.ign.com/dragon-age-4/235195/news/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">IGN</a></em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">BioWare fans are no doubt very disappointed by the news. It will be interesting to see how such decisions impact ongoing projects like the next Mass Effect title, which can potentially decide the studio's future in general. The once-beloved developer likely cannot afford another commercial disappointment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-ray-traced-global-illumination/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod now available for download introduces ray-traced global illumination and significantly improves lighting, but with a barrier of entry.</p>
<p>The FF7 Rebirth RTGI Remake-Grading ReShade preset, now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/222?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, addresses what is possibly one of the game's most glaring issues, the lighting, which makes the image look washed out and is a considerable step down from Final Fantasy VII Remake's lighting. The aim of the preset created by ShinObi12 is to bring the contrast and tone closer to that of Remake, which was used as a reference, and tame the adaption to feel more natural while adding RT bounce lighting. Judging from the comparison screenshot, the preset definitely achieves what it sets out to do, giving the game a more natural look in both indoor and outdoor locations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this ReShade preset is not exactly available for free, as it requires Pascal Gilcher's iMMERSE Pro shader, which can be downloaded by subscribing to the developer's <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> Ray Tracers tier. On the other hand, the cost of the subscription is only $5, which is definitely worth the visual improvements the shader can bring to a lot of games both old and new.</p>
<p>Despite some issues besides the downgraded lighting system over Remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is doing great on PC, as the game was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-had-great-steam-launch-best-selling-game-of-the-week-ending-jan-25/">best-selling game on Steam for the week ending January 25th</a>. The game's success is totally deserved, as it is an excellent continuation of the series, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 can't come soon enough, as the Japanese company has clearly overestimated the life left in the current consoles, according to a well-known analyst.</p>
<p>Commenting on the company's latest financial report with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-cant-come-soon-enough-nintendo-lowers-forecast-again-as-switch-sales-decline-30/">VGC</a>, which confirmed the original Switch surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/">150 million units sold worldwide</a>, Kantan Games' Serkan Toto highlighted how the new system can't come soon enough, as the company clearly overestimated the life left in the current system, which was highlighted by Nintendo revising its hardware sales forecast two times. The analyst, who feels that even the new lower forecast will be missed, is not sure why Nintendo thought they would sell 14 million units in the current fiscal year, especially with a pretty empty release schedule, which currently only includes Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. As such, the Nintendo Switch 2 can't come soon enough, and hopefully not this Fall, the analyst added.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of a solid release date for the Nintendo Switch 2, the excitement surrounding the system continues to be high among both fans and developers.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization VII</a> executive producer Dennis Shirk recently talked with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-dev-firaxis-remains-coy-on-nintendo-switch-2-mouse-joy-con" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a> about the system, saying that Nintendo is doing something very cool with the new Joy-Con controller and that it would be equally cool if the controller could be used as a mouse, as the reveal video suggested. While this is not exactly a confirmation, it definitely feels like there's still a lot we do not know about the new controller.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2025 release date worldwide.</p>

			<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/dragon-ball-sparking-zero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> is continuing to be a smashing success and has now reached an important milestone that has made it the fastest-selling Dragon Ball game to date on consoles.</p>
<p>Today, Bandai Namco confirmed that the new entry in the Budokai Tenkaichi series, released last October on PC and consoles, has sold over 5 million units worldwide since its launch. As mentioned above, this milestone makes the game the fastest-selling Dragon Ball console game to date, which is no small feat considering how many successful games based on the works of Akira Toriyama have been released over the years.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO's success is completely deserved, as the game developed by Spike Chunsoft is a labor of love that can be enjoyed by any fan of the series, regardless of their skill level. If you have always dreamed about immersing yourself in the world created by Akira Toriyama and unleashing energy beams while shouting the name of the technique, this is the game for you, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-an-explosive-love-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is undeniably one of the best games based on Akira Toriyama's series. With an engaging story mode that includes intriguing what-if scenarios, a combat system that's easy to learn but challenging to master, a massive character roster, and impressive attention to detail, Spike Chunsoft has created a must-have for Dragon Ball fans. If you've ever wanted to be Goku and scream your heart out before unleashing secret techniques, this is the game for you.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
