			<p>KO_OP, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/goodbye-volcano-high/">2023's Goodbye Volcano High</a>, has just revealed and released its latest game, Young Suns. The new title is an early access release that's been shadow-dropped on Xbox Game Pass as a Game Preview title, though it'll arrive on other platforms at some point in the future.</p>



<p>Like Goodbye Volcano High before it, Young Suns is a narrative-driven game, though this time it is a 1-4 player narrative sim that takes place in space, in a distant future where you step into the space boots of Sundog, one of the last remaining ship owners following a revolt that drove back a predatory corporation.</p>



<p>Now, with the people of Jupiter recently freed, you have to step up to try and build the better world they all just got done fighting for, and meet the 30 "<em>full realized</em>" characters to learn what problems they're dealing with and how you can help them.</p>

<p>On the game's <a href="https://www.youngsuns.com/roadmap">official website</a>, on its roadmap, KO_OP says it'll focus on new features like character and friendship tracking, an overhaul of the workbench, new cosmetic items like clothing and furniture, and, of course, bug and balance fixes. </p>



<p>Releases on new platforms like Steam, which is currently the only other platform we know it'll be coming to, as there's no word on a PlayStation or Nintendo release, are left for the "<em>In the future"</em> section of the roadmap.</p>



<p>Ahead of that, even more features, like introducing wildlife on the planets you explore, mini games, new story quests, and a photo mode, are currently planned to arrive shortly after the initial friendship tracking and workbench updates.</p>
