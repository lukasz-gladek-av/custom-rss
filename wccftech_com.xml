			<p>Firaxis has launched the next update for Civilization VII, which has made some of the changes listed from the content roadmap that they released. Most of the content from the update are updates and suggestions that have been left by the community and the feedback provided. Below are some of the highlights of the update.</p>
<p>First is the new Natural Wonder that all players will be able to discover for free, which is the Bermuda Triangle. Cross-play between PC and consoles will also be re-enabled when this update releases. The update includes UI adjustments and addressing reported issues from the dedicated community.</p>
<p>For those that manage to make it to the Modern Age, there have now been some major changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory, as AI leaders have now been given a better opportunity at completing a Cultural Victory. This means that players can expect to see fewer Explorer Unit stacks scattered across the map.</p>
<p>Those going for a Religious Victory will now be able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. When players create their own Missionary Units, they will automatically follow the player's chosen Religion.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-disperse-an-independent-power-in-civilization-7/">Dispersing Independent Powers</a> is a large part of Civilization VII, and previously, land units were the only ones able to disperse them. Now, Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers, which can be incredibly helpful if you don't have units in that area.</p>
<p>Along with this update, it's announced that the first in-game event that was planned for Civilization VII will instead be postponed to a later update. This includes future events as well, with them all taking a backseat so that the developers can focus on prioritizing quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide.</p>
<p>After today's update, there will then be another major update taking place this month, with Update 1.1.1 of Civilization VII slated for March 25 (subject to change). This will add in the Quick Move functionality, as well as the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities and a new Natural Wonder, which is available to all players.</p>
<p>Looking even further into the future, the developers are planning on adding new map sizes for all platforms except Nintendo Switch, mod tools and Steam Workshop support, and further customizations that can be made to a player's game.</p>
<p>If you want the nitty-gritty of each change made in today's update to Civilization VII, or any future updates, you can find the information on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Civilization VII website</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Sony has announced the new PlayStation Beta program. You may remember participating in previous limited-time beta programs for various system updates for PlayStation consoles, but this will be a unified Beta program going forward. Sony says it will be an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up for future beta testing across a wide range of PlayStation experiences.</p>
<p>With a single sign-up to the Beta Program at PlayStation, users may register their interest in testing access to participating games for the PlayStation 5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on the official PlayStation website. Interested users only need to register to be considered for all these different betas, and if they receive an invitation to a specific beta, it's of course up to them to decide whether to take part.</p>
<p>Here are the requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players must have a valid PlayStation Network account in good standing with a current email address. Accounts with restrictions or violations may not be eligible.</li>
<li>Players must live in the region where the PlayStation Beta program is available on PlayStation. For example, it is not yet available in Italy, as well as likely in many other countries across the world at this time.</li>
<li>Players must be of legal age in their region.</li>
<li>It's free to join, and registration is open worldwide from today <a href="http://playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this address</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sony also clarifies that sometimes there simply may be more interest than they can accommodate. Joining the PlayStation Beta program will allow you to be considered for beta participation, but it doesn't guarantee that you will be selected for a beta test.</p>
