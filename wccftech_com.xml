			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds mods, which are now available online, introduce new graphics options and quality-of-life enhancements that can improve performance and the overall experience.</p>
<p>The new graphics options are introduced by the aptly named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/816?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Graphics Options mod</a> created by Aiyke. These include mesh level of detail bias, foliage LOD offset/bias, the ability to disable texture streaming and dynamic shadows and to change small object culling ratio. While adjusting any of these options will impact the game's visuals considerably, it can also improve the game's performance, so the mod is definitely worth a try for those who are having trouble running the game with an acceptable level of performance.</p>
<p>While not every Monster Hunter Wilds player will see some benefit from the new graphics options, the vast majority will definitely appreciate the new quality-of-life gameplay improvements introduced by the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/839?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All in One Menu</a> by Reena, which introduced new options in the main menu, such as the ability to access the Smithy, change equipment and transfer items directly from the menu, without having to return to camp. Especially during the endgame, Monster Hunter Wilds wants hunters to be out on the field constantly, so these options are extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched last month on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. While the experience is marred by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">bad performance</a> on pretty much anything that isn't a top-end machine, the game is still one of the best entries in the series, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 patent that was updated a few days ago provides additional details on AI-powered upscaling, strongly indicating that the system will indeed support the technology in some capacity.</p>
<p>As spotted by Mike Odyssey, the patent was updated last week on March 13th with some additional details on how AI-upscaling works, taking a 520p resolution image and upscaling it to a 1080p resolution output using a neural network. The 520p and 1080p resolutions mentioned in the patent may also indicate how the tech will be used in handheld mode, confirming the console's screen resolution, but there's nothing in the updated patent that suggests a specific use case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo just released an update for Nintendo Switch 2 on AI resolution Upscaling. It's happening, folks! <a href="https://t.co/6GZUEXeBli">pic.twitter.com/6GZUEXeBli</a></p>
<p>— Mike Odyssey - Nintendo Switch 2 Experience Dallas (@MikeOdysseyYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1901107300581937596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Considering how the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by NVIDIA technology, how DLSS itself was mentioned in a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/"> previous patent,</a> and how Nintendo has already used AMD FSR in some of its original Switch games, there's little doubt that the console will support AI-upscaling in some form, although we will probably only get confirmation during the April 2nd Nintendo Direct. According to Kiwi Talks host Reece Reilly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-720p-resolution/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will be the star of the show, as its true, proper unveiling will blow everything else in the Direct out of the water.</p>

<p lang="en">In less than a month in the Switch 2 direct you'll see that Nintendo &amp; Retro were keeping their cards close to their chest with Metroid Prime 4 for this exact moment. The true unveiling will blow everything else in the direct out of the water.</p>

<p>The April 2nd Direct will likely confirm the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, which, according to analysts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">former Nintendo employees</a>, will be in early summer. The fact that<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-400000-units-shipped-north-america/"> around 400,000 units were reportedly shipped to North America in January</a> suggests that the console's release is indeed not too far off.</p>
