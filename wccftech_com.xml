			<p>Epic Games has <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1866894827930976259" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-ballistic-is-a-5v5-tactical-first-person-competitive-mode-launching-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortnite Ballistic</a> is now available on early access as planned. This is a 5-versus-5 tactical competitive mode made exclusively for first-person view. Here, players are always split into attackers and defenders, and each team is tasked with an opposing goal: to either plant a Rift Point Device at one of two sites on the map or prevent this from happening, respectively.</p>
<p>All matches in Fortnite Ballistic begin with players on each team selecting one of five Flex Gadgets that they alone will be able to purchase and use. Each Flex Gadget is very powerful, according to Epic, enough to potentially turn the tide of a match if used correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Proximity Mine can be placed on the floor, wall, or ceiling to surprise an unsuspecting enemy. They can be picked up and placed again and will explode if shot.</li>
<li>The Bubble Shield allows you to drop a temporary protective bubble that shields you and your team from bullets and grenades alike.</li>
<li>The Recon Grenade gadget will mark any enemies near where it's thrown, even through walls. Throw a Recon Gadget into a location before entering to get an idea of who might be waiting for you.</li>
<li>The regular but always trustworthy Frag Grenade couldn't be missing, of course. It will bounce and explode as you'd expect, dealing damage to nearby enemies. In Fortnite Ballistic, you'll take damage from your own grenades, but the same does not apply to allies.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the Impulse Grenade gadget is a disruptive tool that scatters enemies and allies. It has many creative uses, such as launching teammates into a location from a distance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, Epic Games also announced that Fortnite creators can publish Islands using the First Person Camera Mode device, allowing even more dedicated first-person experiences to be created and shared throughout the game. It certainly looks like Epic is pushing hard to improve first-person content in their title.</p>

			<p>As the winter season is fully underway, a lot of games are now getting their festive updates, and this includes Dying Light 2: Staying Human. The festive update for this game is called Winter Tales: Gifts from Above and sees Villedor back in the holiday spirit. This festive update comes to the game today, alongside the release of Patch 1.20, with the event being accessible until January 2, 2025. This update shows Villedor becoming a beautiful snow-covered landscape with a tree in the middle. However, the tree is missing decorations, and players need to complete bounties from Baka or loot containers to get the trinkets, ornaments, and decorations needed to dress up the tree for the festive season.</p>
<p>The players who commit to the Winter event in Dying Light 2: Stay Human to get the tree fully decorated will be rewarded with gifts such as the Killer Krampus Outfit and Winter Sweets, which are in-game currency that can be spent at Baka's stall. Baka's stall is out with the old and in with the new, swapping from a Halloween stand to a festive shack, including boomerang-style Skoll, Snowballs, and even The Punisher weapon for those who are looking for new ways to take down the zombies.</p>
<p>The more you increase Baka's reputation, you'll be given a letter that you can then send off to Santa using the post box next to the stall, which will provide you with a festive airdrop full of gifts to enjoy. The rewards will change frequently, meaning that players will have to stay on top of the airdrop challenges to ensure that they get the entire Killer Krampus Gear Set.</p>
<p>During the Winter Tales: Gifts From Above event, players will be introduced to a new enemy. This event usually comes with Uncle Snows and the Naughty Infected and Virals, but now he has a new enemy for players to face off against. This enemy is the Ice Spitter, who will shoot projectiles at the player.</p>
<p>As stated above, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-gets-major-ps5-pro-enhancements-with-ray-tracing-and-or-higher-graphics-settings/">one final update</a> for the year is coming along with the Winter update. This is Patch 1.20, and is dedicated to streamlining the Prologue so that players can experience the intense action much faster. Of course, it also focuses on fixing some of the most reported issues, such as the headless Aiden during a stomp animation.</p>
<p>As a final gift to players of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, players will be able to grab the Above the Law Bundle for free until January 2.</p>
<p>For those who have yet to experience Dying Light 1 or Dying Light 2: Stay Human, they are both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on discount of up to 80%</a>.</p>
