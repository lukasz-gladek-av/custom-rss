			<p>Shortly after a new look at Yoshi and the reveal of Bowser Jr. in the film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">leaked by an image of a Pillsbury Cookie Dough box</a>, Nintendo announced that it will host a Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the Super Mario Galaxy Movie this coming Wednesday, November 12, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427">announced on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and in the Nintendo Today! app. The post on X (formerly Twitter) clarifies that there will be no video game-related news, so don't expect anything game-related. This Direct is specifically focused on the film, and that's it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Join us on Wednesday, Nov 12, at 6am PT for the Nintendo Direct featuring the world premiere of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie official trailer. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p><p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/KNSvfYk64l">https://t.co/KNSvfYk64l</a> <a href="https://t.co/PfTUJTyMQ3">pic.twitter.com/PfTUJTyMQ3</a></p></div>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The news of this Direct isn't exactly surprising, considering that just last week, a report (that we now know was at least partially correct) <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reportedly-appear-before-wicked-for-good/">claimed that the first proper trailer for the film would be shown online soon</a>, since it would also be shown at upcoming screenings of Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part-two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical.</p>



<p>We'll almost definitely see the first proper trailer for the film on Wednesday, and, if this Direct will be anything like the Direct event Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-movie-first-trailer-chris-pratt-voice/">did for the Super Mario Bros Movie</a>, we'll also likely find out the rest of the cast (save for those who are returning) and discover a little more about the film's plot.</p>



<p>The first Super Mario Bros. Movie was a massive hit at the box office, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/">making over $500 million in its first week</a>, and eventually eclipsing $1.3 billion globally. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">sequel was confirmed soon after</a>, which, if it keeps its current April 3, 2026 premiere date, will arrive almost three years to the date from when the first film premiered.</p>

			<p>Almost every quest in The Outer Worlds 2 can be approached in different ways. You can talk your way into and out of situations, you can sneak around your enemies, or hack a computer to gain access to some secret information that gets you in or just opens a door that ought to be locked. There's rarely a quest that can only really be completed one way. The 'In Pursuit of Purloined Propaganda' quest, however, is one of those rare quests.</p>



<p>All it has you do is run around and find a few magazines. Well, more than a few, which is why this guide will help you find them all as quickly as possible so you can get back to the regular, more fun kind of adventuring that The Outer Worlds 2 is chock-full of.</p>



<p>That said, it's still worth your time running around to find all these magazines, especially if you're still in the early stages of your playthrough. It'll take you to far corners of the opening planet, Paradise, and unlock some key fast travel points along the way that can make future quests easier to complete.</p>

<h3 id="h-finding-redactor-quesnel">Finding Redactor Quesnel</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Redactor Quesnel in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To get this quest started, you'll have to find Redactor Quesnel and speak to her. You'll find her on her porch at her house just west of Fairfield, as shown on the map below.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Where to find Redactor Quesnel in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speak to her, and agree to help her find copies of the Science Adventures Quarterly, 'Featuring Commander Zane and Buddy and other Sensationalistic Space Stories.' Once you've agreed to the quest, she'll stay on her porch, so take the chance of her being outside her house to walk in and rob her of a few Bit Catridges and other resources scattered in her house. It's not much, but to not steal from her would be to go against one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/the-outer-worlds-2-tips-and-tricks-guide/">key things to know about playing The Outer Worlds 2: Always be Looting</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-finding-all-ten-science-adventure-magazines">Finding All Ten Science Adventure Magazines</h3>



<p>There are ten magazines to find in total, but you'll want to return to Redactor Quesnel after finding at least one. You'll gain some XP, some bits, and be sent back on your way. When you have another four, return to her again for more XP, bits, and a Pitchball Card that gives you a damage upgrade. </p>



<p>Return to her when you have the final five, and you'll get the full rewards of a Townie Clothing set and a bunch more XP.</p>



<p>Here's where to find each of the magazine issues, though not in order from one to ten, but rather in an order that I believe is the fastest way to find them all, starting from Redactor Quesnel's house.</p>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #5</strong> - You'll find this one just north of where Redactor Quesnel's home is, so it's an easy trod up the road to grab your first issue. It also makes it easy to grab it and head back to her for your first reward.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #3 - </strong>Assuming you're following this guide to the letter, the next one to grab is the third issue, northwest of Redactor Quesnel's home. Simple directions to it would be to head north to where you found issue #5, then turn directly west. You'll find it on a table outside of a house with a malfunctioning door, which you can open if you have the right skills.</p>

<figure><figcaption><em>You'll find issue #3 outside of a house with a broken door.</em></figcaption></figure>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #8 - </strong>From where you found issue #3, head as directly south as you can to find issue #8 on the coastline. You'll find it in a room on the second floor of the tower, though be warned that you'll likely have to deal with a few crabbles to grab it. There's also a safe and a bunch of loot behind a door you can pick the lock of on the first floor, if you have the right skills for it.</p>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #6 - </strong>Once you've grabbed issue #8, fast travel back to Fairfield. From there, head east along the coastline, and you'll find issue #6 in a fisherman's hut on a bed, with two fishermen working outside. Inside the hut, you'll also find an Advanced Decryption Key, so be sure not to miss that.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #2 - </strong>After finding issue #6, fast travel back to where you found issue #8 at the Crabble Tower. From there, follow the coastline all the way south, past the Mysterious Cave where you can stop and fight the Skeleton Crabble if you like, and head to the most southern point on the map.</p>



<p>You'll find issue #2 on a porch, outside of a sealed house. You will have to jump over the railing to get to it, though, where you'll find it on a table beside a couple of other resources.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #9 - </strong>If you've not yet completed the Perilous Journey to the Grove quest, then you've probably not gone up the cliff where the lift is, just west of where you'll find the fast travel point for Fairfield on the map. If you've fixed the lift (which you can do by having an Engineer level of three or higher), then just head up the lift and to the point on the map below. </p>



<p>If you don't have an Engineer skill of level three or higher, then there's a quick way to hop up the cliff. Look to the left of where the controls are to fix the lift, and you'll see a ramp leading up some boxes. Jump on the boxes, use them to jump onto the roof to your right, and use that to jump on to the cliff, so you can walk up to where the lift is stuck halfway down, jump across, and up to the top.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>Head to the lift here, just west of the fast travel point for Fairfield.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>If you can't repair the lift at the control box on the right, use this ramp to go up the boxes and to the roof above you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>From there, jump onto the side of the cliff, and use the broken lift to get across and up on the other side.</em></figcaption></figure>

<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Once you're at the top, however you've gotten there, head to the point on the map below. You'll find issue #9 in a building that's also a raptidon ambush trap. Once you open the door, you'll be ambushed by raptidons, so be prepared for that. After you've cleared them out, you'll find issue #9 on a bed in the house.</p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #1</strong> - Getting to this issue is arguably the biggest trek you'll have to make if you've not already been out this way. If you've visited Westport already, then you can just fast-travel to it and head to the point on the map. If not, then starting from Fairfield, follow the tracks as far east as they'll go, and then turn north. You'll find issue #1 in a house defended by some large crabbles, so be prepared to either fight them or sneak around them.</p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #4 - </strong>Even though you'll have seven out of ten magazine issues at this point, this is a sort of halfway point for the quest because the rest of the magazines, including issue #4, are found across the bridge that is guarded by the Protectorate, the same bridge you have to cross to get to the Vox Relay.</p>



<p>Whichever way you get to the Vox Relay is up to you. You can try storming the gates with other Auntie's Choice forces, you can agree to do something for the guard at the bridge that you'll get you across, you can try sneaking across. Once you're across, you can head east to the point on the map below, where you'll find magazine issue #4 at another fisherman's hut on a table along the coast.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>You'll find issue #4 here, at this fisherman's hut along the coast.</em></figcaption></figure>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #7</strong> - Thankfully, issue #7 and issue #10 are close by to each other, making the last two pick-ups easy before heading back to Redactor Quesnel. In as straight a line as you can, head almost exactly northwest from where you find issue #4. That will lead you to the building where you'll find issue #7, as shown on the map below.</p>



<p>Fair warning, the small hut where you'll find issue #7 is inside a Protectorate-controlled farm, so you'll have to deal with those forces or sneak around them to get the magazine. Thankfully, neither option should give you much trouble.</p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #10 - </strong>Head slightly northwest from where you found issue #7, and you'll find one final fisherman's hut along the shoreline, and just outside of the hut, on a table, is issue #10 and the final magazine needed to complete the quest. </p>



<p>Be warned though, you'll likely happen upon a group of Crabble and Raptidon's fighting, so you'll have to clear them away before you can grab the magazine.</p>

<h3 id="h-return-to-redactor-quesnel">Return to Redactor Quesnel</h3>



<p>Once you've found the remaining magazines and have collected all ten, return to Redactor Quesnel for a final time to receive the full rewards for the quest.</p>
