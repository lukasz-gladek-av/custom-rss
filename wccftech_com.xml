			<p>So far, GTA London 1969 remains the only installment in the franchise to take place outside of the United States. Fans have long wondered if Rockstar would ever return to London or perhaps even bring the series elsewhere in the world. </p>



<p>However, based on the statement relayed by Dan Houser (who wrote all the games in the series save for the upcoming sixth), that seems unlikely. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, he explained that the franchise is intrinsically linked to American culture. </p>



<p><em>We made a little thing in London 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down for the PS1. That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Houser <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-dan-houser-co-founder-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Rockstar Games in early 2020</a>, so it isn't really up to him anymore. That said, having worked there for twenty-two years, he certainly has a sound inkling as to the way the studio thinks about its prized IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creator-reveals-favorite-character-says-llms-will-be-good-at-cheap-stuff-not-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elsewhere in the interview</a>, Dan Houser mentioned that his favorite character in the series was GTA IV's Niko Bellic, as the most earnest and nicest of all, although he also mentioned CJ from San Andreas and Michael De Santa from GTA V as standout, partly due to the respective voice actors doing a great job at bringing them to life.</p>



<p>Houser then said he isn't worried about generative-trained large language models taking the jobs of writers because he reckons that LLMs can only create cheap, decent stuff, but are unable to come out with new, interesting ideas, which is where 'magic' comes from in writing.</p>
