			<p>PlayStation has been sued in the Netherlands over the high prices of digital games and in-game content, which the company can force upon users with its dominant position in the market.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-playstation-sued-in-the-netherlands-in-class-action-lawsuit-over-artificially-high-playstation-prices.1226472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument, a Dutch non-profit consumer foundation representing large groups of consumers in class action lawsuits, confirmed today on its<a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/nieuws/2025-06-24-sony-gedagvaard-in-collectieve-rechtszaak-om-kunstmatig-hoge-playstation-prijzen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website</a> that it has summoned Sony in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Dutch PlayStation players over the company exploiting its dominant position in the console market, and denying potential app stores access to its gaming systems. The class action lawsuit is the culmination of the Fair PlayStation campaign launched back in February, which highlighted how, in the PlayStation 5 generation, consumers are being pushed more and more towards digital-only consoles, where games and in-game content can only be purchased exclusively via the PlayStation Store. This dominant position led to the establishment of the so-called Sony tax, artificially high prices that make gamers pay much more for digital games and in-game content than they would in a free market.</p>
<p>In its summons, the Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument foundation accuses PlayStation of excluding competition and exploiting consumers and game developers, utilizing its dominant position in the market. By removing consumers' and third-party publishers' choice, Sony greatly profits from the situation, making more than twice as much margin on digital sales as on retail copies. As such, the advantages of digital distribution go entirely to the Japanese company. Since 2013, the damage to Dutch consumers has amounted to 435 million euros.</p>
<p>The next step in this class action lawsuit will be the first hearing, which may already take place this year. The Dutch court will evaluate its jurisdiction on the matter and the admissibility of the foundation. If the court grants the claim, the foundation expects Sony to be forced to open the market for selling digital PlayStation content to other providers, which is extremely unlikely to happen, at least not directly via PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>With the pricing of digital games on PlayStation 5 being extremely high and the market being pushed more and more towards an all-digital future, there's definitely some merit to the Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument class action lawsuit. Hopefully, this will lead to some much-needed changes, especially at a time when gaming is becoming an increasingly more expensive hobby, with prices of <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">consoles</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">games</a> rising across the board.</p>

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a massive improvement over the original in terms of visuals and a very effective showcase of the Decima Engine.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nick930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick930</a> puts the second entry in the series side-by-side with the Director's Cut release of the first entry in the franchise by Hideo Kojima running on PlayStation 5 Pro, comparing character models, environments, animations, and more. By all metrics, the new entry in the series is a massive improvement over its predecessor, and a great showcase of what can be achieved using the Decima Engine, so much so that the two games don't feel like they are only five years apart.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2: On the Beach vs Original | Direct Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nyMDgwTET2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach doesn't just look better than its predecessor, but it's also a better game, and the culmination of Hideo Kojima's best and worst ideas, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review-in-progress</a>.</p>
<p><em>As impossible to describe as the first, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a culmination of some of Kojima's best (and worst) ideas all in one package that's more cohesive and less coherent than anything his team has done so far.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on PlayStation 5 on June 26th worldwide. Owners of the Deluxe Edition can play the game already, thanks to the included 48-hour early access perk.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Fatshark announced the release of the first paid DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Darktide</a>. Priced at $11.99 for the Standard Edition and at $18.99 for the Deluxe Edition, the DLC provides access to a new class, the Adeptus Arbites, who can rely on a Cyber-Mastiff companion, which players can customize in name and looks. The Cyber-Mastiff has its own Passive target selection, which it will use to help players against anything that comes too close. The Cyber-Mastiff can also be commanded to attack a specific target, which will override any behavior of its own. To command the Cyber-Mastiff, double-tap the Tag Input on any enemy eligible to be Tagged.</p>
<p>Arbites have plenty of options to customize their playstyle, with Talent Tree sections like Elite Killing and Cyber-Mastiff Handling, Hybrid Combat and Supportive Utility, and Crowd Control and Melee. Those who don't enjoy having a companion can even grab the Lone-Wolf talent, which removes access to the Cyber-Mastiff but provides +15% Toughness Damage Reduction, +10% Attack Speed, +10% Damage, +1 increased Charges on your Blitz Abilities, and replenishes a charge of Blitz Ability every 60 seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVaGC0xXUVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the Arbites DLC, Warhammer 40K Darktide was also updated with a free patch titled The Battle for Tertium. The core player experience has been overhauled to provide a clearer narrative focus on the Battle for Tertium. Players will now experience a linear campaign featuring new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. This new progression path is designed to make it easier for new players to get started and gradually unlock features previously restricted by character level. Previously, each new player's experience was completely random. However, the Battle for Tertium narrative presents maps, enemies, and characters in a specific order, enabling players to discover all aspects of the game at a much better pace.</p>
<p>Fatshark has even introduced a new mission board system. Missions will no longer be tied to a specific difficulty, meaning you can select a mission and then choose your desired difficulty. This effectively increases the number of mission options available to players of all levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, the difficulty system in Warhammer 40K Darktide has been completely revamped. Rather than leveling up your characters, you now unlock new difficulties by completing missions. You must prove your skills at your current maximum difficulty to unlock access to the next difficulty. The studio believes it will motivate new players to master the game step by step and give veteran players confidence that their teammates have earned their place.</p>
<p>There's also a new Inferno in-game event running until July 7, and a new Havoc campaign. Lastly, the maximum number of Operatives was increased to 8, and the maximum number of weapon loadouts received the same treatment. Players will also hear around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>
