			<p>Today, Marvel Games and NetEase Games officially announced the details for the first season of Marvel Rivals. The season is titled Eternal Night Falls and will be adding some familiar faces to the ever-expanding roster of heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. The first season for this new Hero-Shooter will begin on January 10 at 9 AM UTC, where the Fantastic Four will be introduced to the game as playable heroes. Thus far, the title has <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/">been incredibly successful</a>.</p>
<p>The season will span over three months and will be divided into two halves. In the first half of the season, Invisible Woman and Mister Fantastic will be released. For those wanting Human Torch and The Thing, you'll have to wait until the second half of the season. Season 1 of Marvel Rivals is doing more than just adding superheroes to the game, as there will be three new maps for players to explore and learn when playing.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls, make sure to check out the trailer below to get a glimpse of some of the action you will be diving into, as well as the cosmetics you can get your mitts on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zATLJ6Cqt0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to new heroes and maps, there will be some special events for players to dive into, including a new Doom Match game mode. Like many free-to-play titles with live service elements, there will be a Battle Pass for players to dive into. Compared to Season 0, this Battle Pass has over double the amount of content and rewards to get. These rewards consist of 10 costumes, sprays, and emotes to get your hands on to add some extra flair for the battleground. To purchase the Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass for Marvel Rivals, it will cost you 990 Lattice, where you will then get 600 Lattices and 600 Units as a reward for completing the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Compared to other games on the market right now, the team developing this title has made it so that the Luxury Battle Passes will never expire, with Tokens purchased with Lattice being retained under specific conditions. For those interested in what these terms and conditions consist of, the developers have created both a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241225/40954_1202068.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diary</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiYrOSLYD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Vision</a>, where you can read about it or watch a video that explains it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises.1076337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new company comprised of members from Annapurna is set to take over games and franchises that were previously owned by Private Division, a<a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-sells-private-division-gta-vi-on-track-for-release/"> studio owned by Take-Two Interactive</a>. The staff that are creating the team are those who resigned last summer after it was said that there was a significant power struggle that led to the staff resigning. Now, they are taking over the portfolio that belonged to Private Division.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company that will be inheriting the Private Division franchises doesn't yet have a name, but it will gain access to the games and franchises created by Private Division.</p>
<p>The first information came from Take-Two Interactive in November 2024, where they announced that they had sold Private Division to an unnamed buyer for an undisclosed price. In the report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Bloomberg</a>, it seems that private equity firm Haveli Investments was the "unnamed buyer" of the company, with Haveli then going on to make a deal with the Annapurna staff, which gave them the power to take care of the acquired franchises.&nbsp; According to the Bloomberg report, a spokesperson for Haveli was contacted, but they stated that "the firm did not immediately have comment."</p>
<p>Private Division was responsible for creating franchises and games such as Kerbal Space Program, Tales of the Shire, No Rest for the Wicked, and the untitled action-adventure game made in collaboration with Game Freak, which is currently codenamed Project Bloom. No Rest for the Wicked has been confirmed to continue getting support and updates, despite the uncertainty of Private Division at current. Tales of the Shire is the next game to be released, with it set to release on March 25. This game is highly anticipated by many, as it combines the farming game genre with The Lord of the Rings franchise for a cozy experience.</p>
<p>As Haveli acquired the company, they also inherited approximately 20 employees who were working at Private Division. Unfortunately, some of the staff that they've inherited will be laid off as the company gets settled and rearranged. The specifics of this arrangement have not been finalized, and staff have been told to explore their options regarding employment and instability in the company.</p>
<p>Private Division was founded in 2017 as a publisher of mid-sized indie titles. They've published games such as The Outer Worlds, Hades, and Rollerdrome.</p>
