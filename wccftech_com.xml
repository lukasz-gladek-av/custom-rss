			<p>Today, 4A Games Ukraine made two big announcements: one, it's being rebranded to Reburn; two, it is developing a new cooperative sci-fi first-person shooter game called La Quimera.</p>
<p>First things first. Metro fans were probably puzzled by the aforementioned sentence, just like I was when I got the news. Let's clarify things right away, then. Following the beginning of the political instability in Ukraine, dating all the way back to 2014, part of the team at 4A Games moved to Malta. Back then, both studios still worked together on Metro Exodus.</p>
<p>After the launch of Metro Exodus in 2019, 4A Games Malta and 4A Games Ukraine were both big enough to handle projects separately. A few months later, the Malta office <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games-new-world-interactive-and-four-more-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired by Embracer</a>, while the Ukraine office remained independent and received unrelated investments to make its own IP, which would become La Quimera. The studios are effectively separate now, as reflected in the rebrand, although they are both allowed to use the 4A Engine seen in Metro titles.</p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series. We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>

<p>The game is set in a Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle environments. Players will step into the customizable exosuit of a down-on-his-luck PMC (Private Military Company) soldier battling rival factions. The world and story of La Quimera were written and created by movie director Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren. Combining Latin American folklore with advanced weaponry and technology, La Quimera will be playable in single-player mode or with up to two friends in co-op for a total of three players.</p>

<p>Reburn promises that fans of the Metro franchise will enjoy the familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling mixed with new gameplay experiences through unique and highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons. There's no release date yet, but Reburn said more about the game will be revealed in the coming months.</p>
