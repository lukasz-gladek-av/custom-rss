			<p>IO Interactive and Feral Interactive have <a href="https://feralinteractive.com/en/news/?platform=ios&amp;game=hitmanabsolution">announced</a> that Hitman: Absolution will be making its way to handheld devices, with a mobile version of the 2012 game coming to iOS and Android later this fall, followed by a Nintendo Switch version before the end of 2025. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is also in the works, though that won't arrive until 2026.</p>



<p>Feral Interactive is the same porting house that brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-switch-better-ps4/">Alien: Isolation to the Nintendo Switch</a> with extremely impressive visuals, and the team who brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-blood-money-reprisal-is-sneaking-its-way-to-mobile-platforms-this-fall/">Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal</a> to mobile and Nintendo Switch in 2023. This new version of Hitman: Absolution is the studio directly building off its mobile port of Blood Money.</p>



<p>The gameplay trailer that debuted alongside the announcement shows how Feral Interactive is bringing the experience of Absolution onto your mobile devices, with full touchscreen controls, though the studio also clarifies that these versions will also support you plugging in a controller or keyboard and mouse, if you have the time and space for it. </p>

<p>If you're keen to jump into Hitman: Absolution on mobile, then you can pre-order the game today for $14.99 / £9.99 / €12,49. You'll have to wait a little longer for pre-orders to go live on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, however. No specific release date for the mobile versions or the Nintendo Switch versions has been confirmed.</p>
