			<p>Avowed developer Obsidian Entertainment made sure that players will have the opportunity to start most quests in multiple ways. Obsidian's Environment Region Designer Berto Ritger <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/almost-every-quest-in-rpg-avowed-can-be-started-in-multiple-ways-we-want-to-just-constantly-foster-that-sense-of-exploration-wanderlust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> this in an interview with GamesRadar.</p>
<p><em>I think almost every, if not every, quest in the game has it more than one way to start it. You can do things out of order and pick up items and give them to people that want them, or kill a character or whatever, like, you can play things out of order. You can come at a dungeon or vice versa, from a different direction than you normally would. And we want you to be able to do that just based on however you naturally progress through the world. We want to just constantly foster that sense of exploration, wanderlust and just getting lost pleasantly.</em></p>
<p>In my <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview with Avowed</a>, I didn't notice this. However, it's entirely possible I may have simply missed it, as there weren't that many quests to begin with. It's certainly great to be able to start quests in any order - for example, if you happen to find a quest item before you've picked up the quest, you can complete it right away.</p>
<p>That said, after playing around three hours of the game, I feel it best to temper expectations: this isn't an open world that lets you explore as much as something like The Witcher 3 or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. However, there is definitely some room for exploration, even in the starting area. Ritger had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-dev-says-missable-content-is-core-to-what-makes-rpgs-special/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that one of the trademarks of roleplaying games is missable content. It makes them special, as players feel like they're rewarded for exploring the game world thoroughly.</p>
<p>Avowed is slated to launch on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it was delayed merely to give it more space out of the busy Holiday season, while the game itself was largely complete.</p>
