			<p>PlayStation 5 Pro patches for the two games released so far on the base model by Insomniac introduce graphical toggles that allow users to customize their experience further in the vein of PC gaming.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro patches for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which both went live today, introduce new Performance Pro and Fidelity Pro modes, which provide, respectively, 60 FPS gameplay with the same image quality of the standard fidelity mode through PSSR and all ray tracing features, and 30 FPS gameplay and new ray tracing features, which can be tuned individually to reach higher intermediate frame rates when using VRR and 120 Hz Display mode.</p>
<p>The new ray tracing options introduced by the PlayStation 5 Pro Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart patch are RT Reflections and RT Ambient Occlusion, while Marvel's Spider-Man gets RT Key Light Shadows, which uses ray tracing to calculate sun shadows at mid- to distance, replacing cascaded shadow maps, RT Reflections and Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. More details on the patches and the new options they introduce can be found <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344384505101-Version-1-005-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Rift Apart and <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344021452941-Version-1-004-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>The two Insomniac-developed games aren't the only ones that received PlayStation 5 Pro patches ahead of the system's release on November 7th. Other games that were already patched include <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-ps5-pro-patch/">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing/">Alan Wake 2.</a></p>
