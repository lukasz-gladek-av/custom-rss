            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unsurprisingly, the first leak of the year is related to the Nintendo Switch 2. Three pictures of the upcoming console's motherboard have allegedly leaked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>The memory appears to be SK Hynix LPDDR5 48Gbit. The leaked images also show NVIDIA's logo, which is again entirely expected given that previous leaks all pointed to the Nintendo Switch 2 once again being powered by NVIDIA hardware. More specifically, it will use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tegra 239 System-on-Chip (SoC)</a>, which is based on the Orin SoC family. The CPU has eight cores and 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores, while the GPU, based on NVIDIA's Ampere architecture, includes 2048 CUDA Cores. The hardware reportedly supports Deep Learning Super Sampling Super Resolution and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Reconstruction</a>, the latter's inclusion confirming hardware ray tracing support.</p>
<p>According to previous leaks, it won't feature built-in Frame Generation. However, several console games have shipped with AMD FSR Frame Generation, and on PC, it is possible to mix DLSS Super Resolution with FSR Frame Generation. We might see that again from some developers making Nintendo Switch 2 games as a way to extract more performance.</p>
<p>DLSS Ray Reconstruction might be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-superiority-ray-reconstruction-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only real advantage the hardware has over PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X</a>. Otherwise, experts concur that the new console will be much weaker than even the Series S, and it is rumored to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited to 4K resolution and 30 frames per second when docked</a>. Then again, it's nothing new for Nintendo fans - the last competitive console in this regard was the GameCube, which also flopped pretty hard from a sales standpoint.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/">Switch 2 motherboard</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MHN1994/">u/MHN1994</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will once again try to attract a large audience with its seamless combination of handheld and home console that worked so well for its predecessor. The Switch just <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> the lifetime sales of Sony's PlayStation 2 in the United States. Globally, the PS2 is still ahead, but Nintendo's console might get very close before all is said and done.</p>
<p>The increasing pace of the leaks suggests a reveal might be really close. A previous rumor points to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 8 unveiling</a> by Nintendo, while the accessories are <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-launch-on-march-28-says-italian-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be available on the market starting on March 28.</p>

<p>That concludes the 2024 Steam Awards, and these are all of the winners across each category. It's no surprise that Black Myth: Wukong has swept up a ton of awards, especially considering how well they've done for themselves in every other ceremony despite being a widely controversial game.</p>
<p>There are some surprising winners on this list, with games like Red Dead Redemption taking the best soundtrack when games such as Silent Hill 2 and Horizon Forbidden West were competitors in that category. However, Silent Hill 2 did net one award for the best visual style.</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of Balatro and the fact that the game was nominated in multiple categories, it didn't win any awards at this particular ceremony. However, it has been successful in other ceremonies, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards</a>, where it picked up a couple of awards and was even nominated for Game of the Year.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this year's winners of the Steam Awards 2024?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New information from the latest Circana report, as posted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lejpf37m3k2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mat Piscatella on social media</a>, shows that Marvel Rivals is still taking top spots across multiple platforms. This is the hit new hero shooter, where players can pick a number of Marvel characters to play and battle against others in teams. On <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">Steam</a>, Marvel Rivals is in the 1st position and has retained that position for at least a week now. On both Xbox Series and PlayStation 5, the game takes the third spot. It's worth noting that the data for these games only pertains to the US. It isn't too surprising that Marvel Rivals is continuing to be highly successful, with Call of Duty taking the top spot for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.</p>
<p>Most surprisingly, Project Zomboid has shot up the rankings again on Steam and has entered the top 15 on Steam. It takes the 11th spot on Steam after previously being ranked 48 last week. While there doesn't seem to be an ultimately strong cause as to why this has happened, it's possible that it was due to the update that they released for the game on December 17. However, it's an unstable build that only people who opt-in to play them can access, and it's expected that there will be bugs and issues along with the new content. This title has been in Early Access since 2013, and even now, the game is still in Early Access despite receiving a plethora of updates, making it uncertain as to whether this game will ever fully launch.</p>
<p>Another game that has seen a resurgence is Sonic Frontiers. What was a well-received game in 2022 has now ended up taking the 14th spot in the PlayStation 5 rankings. This is due to the game being added to the PS+ catalog, allowing those who are subscribers to get the game for free to keep it until they are no longer subscribed. Other titles such as Jurassic World Evolution 2, Coffee Talk, Aliens: Dark Descent, and Temtem were all added to December's catalog, providing a wide variety for those who are PS Plus members and those who have access to PS Plus Premium and Extra.</p>
<p>Among these titles are games such as Fortnite, Helldivers 2, and Roblox, which doesn't come as a surprise to anyone. These games have been popular throughout the year and have been mainstays for audiences across the globe.</p>
<p>On Steam specifically, Path of Exile 2 has dropped by one ranking and is now down to the 3rd position. While this game has proven to be popular since entering Early Access, they have lately been experiencing an issue where <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-in-security-crisis-after-hackers-raid-players-accounts-stealing-valuables/">accounts are being compromised</a>, and users are losing out on their valuable items, with Grinding Gear Games making no promise to return them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Infinity Nikki</h5><p><span>December 5, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Android, iOS, PlayStation 5, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Typically, I don't do gacha games. The way they work just doesn't gel with me, as I don't want to get sucked in and end up spending money on it, especially when there are tons of other games that I can play where I don't need to spend money to get ahead or be better in the game. Luckily, Infinity Nikki's gacha system is pretty fair compared to some of the others on the market right now. For the most part, there isn't a bad thing I can say about Infinity Nikki, as it is much like the games I used to play when I was younger and loved dress-up games. As an adult, this brings back many feelings of that childhood joy I experienced and allows me to get sucked into a cozy world full of whimsy and color.</p>
<p>To play this game on PC, you must download the independent launcher or play it via the Epic Games Store. I <span>chose to use the&nbsp;<a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent launcher</a> because I find that games launched through the Epic Games Store just don't run well at all for me, possibly because the launcher is not</span> optimized. Of course, the game is also available on PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS devices.</p>
<p>Although I knew that the former Director of Zelda, <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-announced-zelda-botw-designer-producing/">Kentaro Tominaga</a>, was working on Infinity Nikki, it still shocked me just how, like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, it was not just in the sense of the grand exploration, but also from the trials that you can undertake to get Whimstars. The aesthetic of the trials, in particular, is very reminiscent of those from Tears of the Kingdom, especially ones where you have to use your Purah Pad to be able to get from point A to point B.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-10-07-000539.png"></a></figure>

<p>The atmosphere and the aesthetic of the game is breathtaking. Even when you approach the first Warp Spire in the game, the location you get it at is so well decorated and bursting with vibrancy and realism. It's hard not to play Infinity Nikki and take a ton of pictures. Even if you aren't taking pictures of the costumes you unlock for Nikki, there is so much beauty in the surrounding world, especially once you start to progress through the story and discover new locations.</p>
<p>Even without doing the questing, I found myself getting lost in the expansive world, collecting materials that I could use later on to craft new dresses. I've always loved games where I can collect resources and hoard them, and Infinity Nikki allowed me to do just that. Every flower and herb was immediately pocketed, and I continued on my journey.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there wasn't much about Infinity Nikki that I&nbsp;<em>didn't</em> like. The game was magical and everything that younger me would have dreamed of. It definitely appealed to the inner child and allowed me to reminisce about days when I would play dress-up games online. Most controversially, the one character I didn't like was Nikki's sidekick, Momo. They were reminiscent of Paimon from Genshin Impact, and both have voices that I just don't like. Compared to Paimon, Momo was significantly more tolerable but still a touch annoying to listen to.</p>
<p>What surprised me most about Infinity Nikki was the game's performance. Admittedly, I do have a pretty powerful PC that I play it on, but when it comes to Unreal Engine 5 games, they don't have the best reputation for how they perform on PC specifically. For example, Silent Hill 2 was a game that ran terribly for me, even after many patches. However, Infinity Nikki felt like a breath of fresh air with how well it ran, even on Ultra settings. Once I got to the central city, the game was a little bit laggy, so I turned the settings down, and it improved significantly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-10-07-181551.png"></a></figure>

<p>Florawish was a particularly great city to explore, and I loved being able to climb up buildings, stand on the peak, and look over the people and terrain below. There wasn't a single part of it that wasn't teeming with life and vibrancy, and it was the perfect game to slow down, stop, and smell the roses. There's a lot of exploration to do in Florawish alone, with there being hidden chests in nooks and crannies that you may not even spot unless you're traversing the rooftops. It was fun trying to find everything, and I'm sure even now, I've missed a ton of stuff.</p>
<p>Overall, Infinity Nikki is a fantastic experience and is well-optimized, considering it's made in Unreal Engine 5. I had a lot of fun with the game, and I can't wait to see what is added to it with new updates. My main issue is the fact that you can't change the key binds. As someone who is left-handed and suffers from dexterity issues in my hands, I find that using a controller becomes painful after a while. I would love the option to change the key binds to make the experience more comfortable and streamlined.</p>

				<p>Infinity Nikki is a fantastic game, and you can play it while avoiding most of the gacha elements. It's a great gacha game that doesn't require you to pay any money to it to be able to succeed. It's a game full of whimsy, wonder, and most importantly dressing up and being able to customize Nikki to your liking, depending on the outfits you collect.</p>
