			<p>It's only the second week of its open beta, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is already looking like it'll be the game to take over 2025 with how strong its player numbers are on Steam alone. The second week of the beta has already surpassed <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">400K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and now analyst Rhys Elliot of Alinea Analytics is predicting that the game will hit 1 million pre-orders on Steam, after having already hit over 600K. </p>



<p>On X (formerly Twitter), Elliot <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/1955282226632925315">shared</a> a few key data points from Alinea Analytics' tracking of Battlefield 6, like how the firm is claiming that the game has already surpassed 605K pre-orders, and that EA stands to make $35 million in pre-sales revenue. </p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> is on track for a huge launch this year, if it can stick the landing. </p><p>Some Alinea Analytics Steam metrics for you:</p><p>üéØ605 K copies sold via preorderüéØ<br>üí∞Pre-order revenues of $35 millionüí∞<br>üôè2.7 million Steam wishlistsüôè<br>üìà521 K people playing the beta CCUsüìà <a href="https://t.co/UOlS5L5MPP">pic.twitter.com/UOlS5L5MPP</a></p></div>‚Äî Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1955282226632925315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-the-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-one-million-in-steam-pre-orders">Eurogamer</a>, Elliot elaborated on his predictions for Battlefield 6, saying that he believes it will pass "<em>a million in pre-sales</em>," and that the continued success of the game will be dependent on how EA can carry the momentum the beta is building into launch, and if it can stand out among other major shooters being released close to it, like Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>"<em>As we head into the Autumn period there'll be a lot more going on, but as of right now it's on track to do extremely well: the best Battlefield has ever done</em>,<em>" </em>Elliot said.</p>



<p>That said, Elliot is more realistic than EA executives and believes the target <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">'100 million players'</a> is "<em>completely unrealstic</em>." He's also not in agreement with former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, and doesn't think that EA's comeback with the series will be able to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/"><em>boot stomp</em>" Call of Duty</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>I think it's important not to conflate Battlefield's pre-launch success - even if it will be a big success - with being a 'CoD Killer'. Yes, Battlefield 6 is making all the right moves with these massive maps, a return to the core classes, the destruction. It is also borrowing a lot of things from CoD. Call of Duty is in a bit of a creative lul and an identity crisis, with Nikki Minaj shooting Beavis and Butthead while Snoop Dogg is twerking in the background. It's weird! But it's still a cultural juggernaut, it has a massive casual audience who buy it on autopilot every year. They complain, but they still buy it, and those habits run deep.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Battlefield 6 is undoubtedly winning over the hardcore FPS crowd, but CoD has that market momentum, the yearly launches, Warzone is there as that big pool for cross pollination marketing and a funnel into Black Ops. CoD has the seasonal content treadmill it's been running for years and years, with streamer partnerships. Whether Battlefield can keep up with that is unclear</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how Battlefield 6 does when it arrives this coming October, but in the meantime you can still check it out this weekend during the remainder of its open beta time. And if you're on PC and having issues getting the beta to launch due to Secure Boot errors, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">check out our guide on how to enable Secure Boot on your PC</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://kalshi.com/">Kalshi</a>, the US prediction market and market trading platform where millions of people bet on major global and cultural events, including things like <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards">what the game of the year will be this year at The Game Awards 2025</a> has crossed a cultural milestone by appearing in an ad for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The ad is a live-action mock-up of fictional news cycles that follow the events of the narrative in Black Ops 7, and at about halfway through the short teaser trailer, a shot of a Kalshi query regarding whether robots will replace human soldiers in the US military is spotted with 76% of fictional bets voting yes, and the remaining 24% saying no.</p>



<p>Kalshi shared the trailer from its official account on X (formerly Twitter), writing, "<em>Kalshi *hands shake emoji* Call of Duty. Prediction markets and culture are now one.</em>"</p>



<p>There are several claims online that Kalshi has partnered with Activision in some way, but there's no official word from either company that the partnership is any deeper than Kalshi appearing in the trailer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>That said, the prediction market's appearance alone is of some significance, as it's another layer of cultural integration for the platform that hasn't yet been seen, especially at such a high scale as this.</p>



<p>We'll provide an update if it becomes clear that there is a deeper partnership here. In the meantime, you can expect to see more of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this coming week, starting on Tuesday, August 19, at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-resident-evil-ghost-of-yotei-fallout-tv-ninja-gaiden-4/">Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live</a>.</p>
