			<p><strong>Ori </strong>developer <strong>Moon Studios</strong> took a big swing with <strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong>, choosing to make something outside of its 2D platforming comfort zone and instead direct its talents into making an action RPG. After its <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/">initial early access launch in <strong>May 2024</strong></a>, it was clear that the game had a lot of unrealized potential, and the time to realize that potential as an early access game. </p>



<p>Now, over a year and a half later, during which the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-patch/">has seen more than</a> a <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-breach-update-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-lots-of-content/">few significant updates</a>, the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-update-gameplay-trailer-moon-studios/">being <strong>a co-op update</strong> that went live last month</a>, it's starting to realize that potential. A little more than <strong>two weeks</strong> after Moon Studios confirmed that the game had sold over <strong>1 million copies</strong>, the developer gave players another sales milestone update: No Rest for the Wicked has officially sold over <strong>1.5 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Hey Wicked fans, it's been only <strong>15 days </strong>since our previous 1 million announcement, and already we're happy to make a small correction," </em>the team wrote on the game's Steam page.<em> "Now it's <strong>1.5 million copies sold so far</strong>. We're honestly so happy to see this as a small dev studio doing internal publishing. We want to thank you, our players, for being here with us, whether it's through your amazing support, sharing</em> <em>your love for the game, giving us constructive feedback, patiently waiting for consoles, or cheering us on from the sidelines.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It’s been only 15 days since our 1 million announcement, and we’re incredibly happy to share a small correction:</p><p>We’ve now reached 1.5 MILLION copies sold!</p><p>Thank you all, you’ve been a huge part of this ❤️</p><p>Last day to get 40% off on Steam: <a href="https://t.co/X1teDv5Q4j">https://t.co/X1teDv5Q4j</a> <a href="https://t.co/kc51LM4JRi">pic.twitter.com/kc51LM4JRi</a></p></div>— No Rest for the Wicked (@wickedgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/wickedgame/status/2019078495964459314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This milestone came just as No Rest for the Wicked closed off a sale where the game was discounted by 40%, and also serves as a means of putting down any fears or concerns<a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/"> that the studio is in any kind of trouble</a>.</p>



<p>Two short years ago, months before Moon Studios would release No Rest for the Wicked, analysts were <a href="https://wccftech.com/games-industry-to-become-even-more-concentrated-pure-play-companies-will-be-challenged-but-hits-like-palworld-will-still-occur/">sharing concerns over how concentrated the industry was becoming</a>, and how it would only become more challenging for smaller studios to make an impact. To see an <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/">independent studio that's also publishing its own game</a> find success is a positive sign, one that we'll hopefully see repeated with other developers throughout 2026. </p>

			<p>Late last year, it seemed like<em> Half-Life 3</em>, the third entry in the Valve series, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-rumors-intensify-on-27th-anniversary-original-game/"><strong>about to be announced</strong></a>. <span>Every&nbsp;<strong>available indication</strong>, whether </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/should-you-give-up-on-half-life-3-no-not-while-work-continues-on-hlx/"><strong><span>updates to the So</span>urce 2 engine</strong></a> or rumors from reliable insiders about <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/"><strong>a trailer in preparation</strong></a>, seemed to point to an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">imminent reveal before the end of 2025</a></strong>. </p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">However,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025 has ended</strong>&nbsp;without any confirmation of what the HLX project is, and the complete lack of information from the usual sources plunged the community into&nbsp;<strong>doom and gloom</strong>, with </span>many starting to doubt the game really exists, or believing it was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<p>While we still don't know if <strong>HLX is indeed the long-awaited Half-Life 3</strong>, we now know that development of the project is <strong>proceeding</strong>, at least in some capacity.</p>



<p><span>A few hours ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/2019536782279557428" target="_blank"><strong>Gabefollower</strong></a>, one of the most&nbsp;<strong>reliable sources</strong>&nbsp;of rumors about Valve's projects, confirmed on X that the latest&nbsp;<em>Deadlock</em>&nbsp;update<strong>&nbsp;includes some new mentions of the HLX project</strong>.</span> By itself, the new mentions don't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mean much</strong>, but at least they have confirmed that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"HLX survived Valve's winter break,"</em> as Gabefollower put.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">community reaction</strong> to the news that development of what is supposedly <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Half-Life 3</em> did not disappoint, divided between those<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> inhaling generous doses of hopium</strong> like <a href="https://x.com/Marcegonz19/status/2019542841836597746"><strong>X user Marcelo</strong></a> and those who believe <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Nothing Ever Happens,"</strong></em> like <a href="https://x.com/souvlaki420/status/2019544321591009472"><strong>X user tzatziki</strong></a>. Others, however, are <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">giving up hope</strong>, now believing <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">HLX is not the third entry in the series</strong>, but something else entirely.</p>



<p><em>'Gabe, I think that it's getting to a point that HLX isnt half life X or 3. I think it's just a new addition to games that could be for moderation, making the games better, or something else completely. Stop giving us hopium that eventually turns into dispairium,'</em> said <a href="https://x.com/d116223reb/status/2019602979784126694"><strong>X user dude3reborn</strong></a>. Was this <strong>a plea</strong> to Gabefollower or to Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve? Who knows, but this statement summarizes well the <strong>wild state</strong> the <em>Half-Life</em> community has been since it started to seem like <em>Half-Life 3</em> wasn't a fever dream, but a <strong>concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Although there's no <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">concrete indication</strong> that HLX could indeed be <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Half-Life 3</em>, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/">datamined discoveries</a></strong> made over the years suggest this project could be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a very interesting game</strong> coming with a lot of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unique mechanics</strong>, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fire and heat conductivity</strong>, a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gravity gun</strong> with complex physics mechanics likely used for puzzles, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">advanced NPC AI with superior hearing</strong> that, on paper, could make for <strong>a very immersive experience</strong>. As for when it will be <strong>revealed</strong>, it's really difficult to say at the moment. </p>
