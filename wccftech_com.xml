			<p>BetaDwarf, the publisher and developer behind Forced, Forced Showdown, and Minion Masters, has announced their latest title. The game was previously under the codename Project F4E and has now been announced as Vaultbreakers. The game promises to be a new take on <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-the-new-visceral-arpg-from-oris-moon-studios-early-access-launch-in-q1-2024/">ARPGs</a> and PvPvE games. You'll get to experience brawler combat with tactical extractions in an evolving fantasy world. If this sounds like something you'd want to play, make sure to check out the reveal trailer for Vaultbreakers below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vaultbreakers - Reveal Trailer - Join the Playtest" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OgdcqiVQgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Vaultbreakers is a hardcore top-down PvPvE ARPG where you can choose to fight off enemies alongside your friends or by yourself as you take on intense missions in a dynamic fantasy world. This game stands out from the crowd thanks to its reactive gameplay. You will get to take on missions that will shift and change based on the choices made by players, as well as actions taken by NPCs. You'll get to explore new environments, such as caves, and uncover ancient rituals.</p>
<p>To keep the combat fresh and keep you on your toes, the enemies will be unpredictable. They are named Changelings, a faction of shapeshifters that can either be controlled by AI or other players, making the battle even harder. You have multiple choices in how you deal with them, with the options to attack them, avoid them entirely, or align with them.</p>
<p>There will be various Champions you can choose from, as well as new perks, items, and Artifacts that can help make you more powerful on your expedition through Vaultbreakers. For those who have a competitive streak, there's also the option to participate in quests to be able to climb leaderboards and get the top ranking among other players.</p>
<p>"The game is set in an evolving world that challenges players to think tactically, adapt dynamically, and battle fiercely. With unpredictable events triggered by Changelings or other players, and with a focus on player skill and knowledge, I believe we are offering a fresh new multiplayer ARPG experience," says Steffen Kabbelgaard, CEO and Game Director at BetaDwarf.</p>
<p>If all of these features are ticking the boxes for you, BetaDwarf will be hosting an exclusive closed playtest of Vaultbreakers on January 31. If you want to get the opportunity to play the game, you can request access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306910/Vaultbreakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a> or through the <a href="https://vaultbreakers.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Vaultbreakers' website</a>. For content creators that partner up with BetaDwarf, Twitch Drop campaigns will be opened to allow players to get a key for the playtest.</p>
<p>The playtest will consist of the first and second chapters of the narrative campaign. Those who get the opportunity to participate will be able to earn Legacy Points that can unlock rewards that will carry over to the official launch.</p>

			<p>It's been confirmed on the official website for Forza Horizon 5 that this previously Xbox-exclusive title will now be coming to PlayStation 5. This is a huge deal for those who were previously unable to play this game due to it only being on Xbox and PC. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-starfield-playstation-5/">rumors were circulating</a> months prior, fans will now be able to dive into this game on PlayStation 5 in the Spring.</p>
<p>Since the game was released, it has received over 40 thematic updates, with two expansions and other content added into the game to keep it fresh for the Forza Horizon fans. Now that it's coming to PlayStation 5, players will have access to the nearly 900 cars available in the game, where they will finally be able to drive along Mexico's roads and experience the Horizon Festival.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news post</a> on the Forza website, it was stated that the PlayStation 5 version of Forza Horizon 5 was developed by Panic Button in partnership with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games. For those who may be worried about missing out on content, fear not. The game will come with all of the same content as the Xbox and PC versions of the title. Additionally, Car Packs and the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions will be available for PlayStation 5 users to purchase should they want to.</p>
<p>The news post also announced that there will be a special free update being added to the game across all platforms, titled Horizon Realms. Realm will allow players to explore a curated collection of the community's favorite previously released Evolving Worlds. There will also be "some other surprises," with details to be released in the future.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is now available to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist on the PlayStation Store</a> today, where players will be able to get updates about when the game is set to release.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be cross-play for all Forza Horizon 5 players across Xbox consoles, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>With Xbox deciding to do away with console exclusives, it will be interesting to see what further Xbox exclusives are revealed to be making their way over to PlayStation 5 in the future. Whether this means PlayStation will see titles like Halo or Senua's Saga: Hellblade II remains to be seen, but we can only hope they will be ported over in the future.</p>
