			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has yet to be released, but a talented fan has already managed to quite convincingly reimagine a small portion of the game in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, an alleged leaked video of the new entry in the series started making the rounds, fooling the vast majority of fans with its great attention to detail. The short video, however, isn't a real leaked video of Grand Theft Auto 6, but an Unreal Engine 5 creation made to look as close as possible to the real leaked videos of the game, which surfaced online a while back, made by a developer known as Long Long Time in around one month. While it may have been disappointing to learn that the video wasn't the first look at the game in a very long time, it is still an interesting watch that showcases the developer's amazing talent at creating a very believable slice of a game we have seen very little of so far.</p>

<p>No matter when it will launch, Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to have a huge impact on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/">video game industry</a> as a whole, so much so that some publishers are planning the release of their own titles so as not to coincide with its launch. Analysts also predict it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, and its failure could have some important consequences for the industry. Not that a failure is likely, judging from fake leaks like the one above, as the hype for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games is only getting bigger the more we inch closer to its late 2025 launch.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be revealed right when the new year starts, judging from some reported behind-the-scenes chatter.</p>
<p>Speaking during this week's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/reflecting-on-the-game-awards-2024-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry Microcast</a>, Chris Dring reported that he has heard some chatter from other people suggesting that the console could be revealed right when the new year starts. As this is chatter, however, Chris Dring stressed that it shouldn't be taken as fact.</p>
<p>Shortly after Chris Dring's statement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal timing became public, Nintendtalk revealed that insiders at major third-party developers suggest that a January reveal for the console is definitely in the cards. Samus Hunter added that the system's official announcement may have been brought forward to early January, before the release of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on January 16th, due to the recent leaks from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-ports-leak-developers-excited/">accessories manufacturers</a>. As all these sources have questionable reliability, however, we have to take all they've said with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Source: Nintendo to reveal Nintendo Switch 2 in January. This is coming from a Major Third Party developer contact I have. Here‚Äôs what they say about the console:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am not sure how much longer I can contain my hype for Nintendo Switch 2 based on literally everything I am hearing that I can't say here or in videos. Good news is, it sounds like I won't be waiting much longer...</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo may advance the next-generation Switch reveal with an announcement that possibly could come before DK. This is to address recent leaks especially of accessories to ensure official news for the public. The remaining announcements of Switch games may come a little later.</p>

<p>Where there's smoke, there's fire, as they say, so it seems very likely that a Nintendo Switch 2 reveal may not be too far off into the future. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
