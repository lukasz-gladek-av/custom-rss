			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced that it would be undergoing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset,"</em></strong> which saw the company <strong>cancel six games, including the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake,</strong></a> delay another <strong>seven unannounced titles</strong>, reportedly including the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">entirely restructuring the company's whole operating model</a>.</p>



<p>To call it a 'major reset' was practically an understatement, as it wasn't just a portfolio reset, but one that will forever change how the French company operates. Perhaps unsurprisingly, its share price didn't take the news well, and, as reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a>, the company's <strong>share price dropped by 34%.</strong></p>



<p>What's worse, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> points out, is that after yesterday's major drop, the company's market cap sits around <strong>€500 million</strong>. Back in 2018, its market cap was closer to <strong>€10 billion</strong>, which means that in just the <strong>last eight years, Ubisoft has lost somewhere in the range of 95% of its value.</strong></p>







<p>At the time of this writing, the company's stock price currently sits at <strong>€4.37</strong>, marking the lowest point for its share price in over a decade, as it hasn't dropped below <strong>€5.00</strong> since 2011. When you look at these historic lows, it's understandable as to why the company's shareholders were calling for the <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf"><strong>Guillemot</strong> <strong>family</strong> to be removed from leadership</a> back in 2024, and why shareholders have reportedly been looking at all options, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">including a buyout</a>, in recent years.</p>



<p>If not for <strong>Tencent</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-to-raise-its-stake-in-ubisoft-aims-to-become-largest-shareholder/">which has continuously raised its importance</a> within Ubisoft over the last few years, solidifying itself as a core partner for the company with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong> last year</a>, chief executive officer and co-founder <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, and the rest of his founding family might've already found themselves ousted from the company they started all the way back in the late 1980s.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, while chief financial officer <strong>Frederick Duguet</strong> did not comment on share price expectations, he emphasized that it's what the company does next that's most important, namely how it can execute its plans now that it is undertaking this "<em>major reset</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>What I can repeat is that we want to focus on execution," </em>said Duguet.<em> "It's a major reset and we want to make sure that everything we've decided will allow the Creative Houses to succeed in their specific role. And we want them to be the best in the world in each and every segment we're in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We will be also entering into a few additional segments. We mentioned that we still have four new IPs in development. But again, the market is super selective. We are on a good path to return to very high quality games, as we've seen lately, but we need to go further and we are convinced that when we do it well, then the return on investment can be exceptional. But you need to be in the top two of each and every segment.</em>"</p>

			<p><strong>Circana</strong> executive director and video game industry analyst <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> has published the final report for video game software and hardware sales in the US for 2025, and all of the work that <strong>EA</strong> and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> put in last year seemingly paid off, because <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was the <strong>best-selling game in the US in 2025.</strong></p>



<p>It officially beat <strong>Call of Duty</strong> on the sales front, a feat that many doubted Battlefield could accomplish. Everyone thought it would give Call of Duty a good deal of competition, but hardly anyone (<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">save for <strong>Mike Ybarra</strong>, who, to his credit, called this outcome back in August 2025</a>) thought that Battlefield 6 would have the juice to really squeeze out Call of Duty on the sales charts.</p>



<p>Even with <strong>Black Ops 7</strong> coming out on top for the monthly sales for December 2025, it was still only able to reach fifth place overall for 2025 premium sales. <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/">despite its performance struggles on PC</a>, had a strong enough launch that it was able to hold onto fourth place for the year. <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>, another game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-boss-borderlands-4-sales-softer-than-expected-poor-pc-release/">had performance issues at launch,</a> came in at third place, and <strong>NBA 2K26</strong> fell behind Battlefield 6 at second place.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the software charts for the year are <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong>, which is the only other non-shooter or annual sports game to make the top-10 alongside Monster Hunter Wilds. <strong>Ghost of Yotei</strong> just missed joining them as it fell to eleventh place on the year, but even that still shows how well <strong>Sucker Punch's</strong> latest was received. Lastly, we'd be remiss to not point out that, once again, <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> was one of the best-selling games of the year, barely making the top charts in the number 20 spot.  </p>







<p>Strong as these software sales were, they were not what drove the US video game market to grow <strong>1.4%</strong> compared to 2024, with the market reaching <strong>$60.7 billion in 2025.</strong> That growth, according to Piscatella, came from <strong>mobile games</strong> and spending on<strong> hardware</strong>, namely the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, and <strong>subscription services</strong>.</p>



<p>But, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczexudooc2v">as Piscatella notes in a separate post</a>, the increased spending wasn't necessarily driven by the number of people spending money on video games going up, but rather the price of everything, including subscription services, going up.</p>



<p>On the hardware side, the Nintendo Switch 2 was unsurprisingly the best-selling console in the US for 2025, reaching <strong>4.4 million units sold</strong> in the US for the year. <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> came behind the Switch 2 in second place for the year.</p>
