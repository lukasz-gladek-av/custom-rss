			<p>A new Monster Hunter Wilds shared online today introduces yet another highly-requested feature that is still missing from the vanilla game.</p>
<p>The Layer Any Weapon mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/496?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a very simple Layered Weapon system that allows hunters to layer the appearance of any weapon onto the currently equipped one, similar to what is possible to do in the vanilla game with armor. Given how the strongest weapons in the game, the Artian weapons, don't have the best looks in most cases, this mod is a must for those who want to look at something other than the mechanical design of these weapons.</p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of the game last month, plenty of mods were released online addressing some of Monster Hunter Wilds' biggest issues, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/">performance</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/">low challenge level</a>. Even with these issues, however, the latest entry in the series proved to be very successful, selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">8 million units in 3 days</a>, the fastest ever for CAPCOM. The game's success, in my opinion, is completely deserved, as it is a very solid game that's really fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ESRB has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40439/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the official rating for the PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, sparking inevitable discussions about the game's imminent debut on Sony's console.</p>
<p>This title went back and forth several times. It was already planned to go fully multiplatform in the beginning, but then Microsoft renegotiated the deal with Disney and Lucasfilm after its acquisition of Bethesda to make it a PC and Xbox exclusive. However, by the time the game actually got its final release date, Microsoft had shifted its policy toward multiplatform releases. At Gamescom 2024, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would launch in December for PC and Xbox and in Spring 2025 for PlayStation 5. The latest rumors point to a release on Sony's console sometime next month and today's finding of the ESRB rating certainly supports this theory.</p>
<p>MachineGames has already published a few post-release updates, although to be fair, the game was already great at launch, as I discussed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Still, some of those improvements could come in handy for this new version. The game now supports fully ray traced shadows; moreover, the most recent update <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-and-path-tracing-support-on-amd-intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> support for path tracing on AMD (and Intel GPU) and AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation integration. Given that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle already <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-an-impressive-ray-tracing-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured a great ray tracing implementation on the Xbox Series X</a>, it is possible the developers might push it even further on the PlayStation 5 Pro, which features several hardware-based ray tracing optimizations.</p>
<p>Could this game be the first path traced title available on the PS5 Pro? Maybe. When we floated the idea of path tracing for Sony's console <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with System Architect Mark Cerny</a>, he remained cautious, adding that developers 'need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PlayStation 5 Pro'. Well, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is likely the most optimized path tracing game available right now, so there's no better candidate in theory. We'll see if MachineGames actually tries it or sticks with a more conservative enhanced ray tracing target.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Always the outspoken game designer, Hazelight's Josef Fares has recently commented on the negative influence that the widespread usage of microtransactions is having on the game industry. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjgQpyc1gh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to YouTube channel Fall Damage</a> in a reaction video to user comments, Fares explained:</p>
<p><em>Of course, and that goes for everything we do at Hazelight. I think that kind of shit affects the design of how the game should be done. Every time you take a design decision based on you making more money in the game, I think it's a huge problem, and it's stopping our industry from a creative perspective.</em></p>
<p>For a few years, especially around 2017-2018, there were instances of highly aggressive microtransactions that triggered massive backlash from fans. Famous instances include <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-hit-by-class-action-for-nba-2k-loot-boxes-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA 2K</a>, Star Wars Battlefront II (where Electronic Arts was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> to remove them just before launch), <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-now-features-gameplay-related-microtransactions-despite-promises-itd-never-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Avengers</a> (in this case, too, the developers had to quickly cut them from the game), and more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-community-is-angry-at-the-new-microtransactions-techland-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2</a>. Microtransactions even made it into several single player games, like <a href="http://wccftech.com/shadow-of-war-director-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a>, various Ubisoft games, and even CAPCOM's <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-time-saving-mtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devil May Cry V</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-mods-bypass-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-gets-microtransactions-for-instant-weapon-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, developers are more careful when implementing microtransactions, sticking strictly to cosmetic items in most cases. However, microtransactions are more pervasive than ever, especially since the game industry isn't growing meaningfully anymore and development budgets continue to increase. The only solution, then, is to try to squeeze more out of the average consumer.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if you don't want anything to do with microtransactions, there are still several games completely devoid of them, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-no-drm-or-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> or even Josef Fares's own Split Fiction, which just launched to positive reviews. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8/10 score from Nathan Birch</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
