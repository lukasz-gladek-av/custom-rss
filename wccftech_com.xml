			<p>In a recent interview with Wall Street Week's David Westin, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on the Bloomberg Television YouTube channel, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed the company's strategy for GTA VI marketing.</p>
<p>So far, we've only had one trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in December 2023</a>. Red Dead Redemption 2 had three trailers scattered over the course of three years, plus a gameplay video and a launch trailer. If this pattern were to be followed, it would inherently mean a delay outside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced Fall 2025 release window</a>. However, Zelnick outlined a different strategy for GTA VI where the marketing will only kick off in earnest when closer to launch, to balance excitement with 'unmet anticipation'.</p>
<p><em>The anticipation for that title (GTA VI) may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property. And I've been around the block a few times and I've been in every</em><br>
<em>entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance.</em></p>
<p><em>We found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement</em><br>
<em>with unmet anticipation. We&nbsp;don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we are trying to do.</em></p>
<p>It sounds a lot like the approach championed by Bethesda with Fallout 4, which was announced and released within six months. Of course, GTA VI was announced a long time ago, but it does seem like we'll get more details and trailers about the game relatively close to launch this time around.</p>
<p>It's not just gamers but also competitors who are waiting to know exactly when the most anticipated entertainment product of all time will debut on the market. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/possibility-of-gta-6-delay-threatens-games-industry-some-companies-are-going-to-tank-if-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by analysts, companies are desperate to guess right if GTA VI will launch this Fall or not, as they will have to try and get out of Rockstar's behemoth to stay afloat. It's certainly no coincidence that the current schedule is nearly wide open, with only Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch in October</a> and Crimson Desert also <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned for the Fall window</a>. Everyone else is waiting to see, just like fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stuttering-issue-registered-in-several-ps5-and-ps5-pro-games-with-vrr-enabled/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a stuttering issue in several PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro games when enabling Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and unlocked frame rate. The report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2smFwG3Xkc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes from Digital Foundry</a>, which investigated the issue across various games. They found out that after twenty to thirty minutes of playing one of these games, stuttering would occur roughly every eight seconds, give or take a few frames here and there.</p>
<p>The following games were confirmed to be affected on both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Last of Us Part One</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part Two Remastered</li>
<li>Diablo IV</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
<li>Elden Ring</li>
<li>Resident Evil 4</li>
<li>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</li>
<li>Metaphor: Refantazio</li>
<li>Kingdom Come Deliverance II</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital Foundry also tested Warhorse's first-person open world role-playing game on Xbox Series X and noticed no such stuttering problem. They also noted that testing took place across various TV sets, eliminating that as a potential factor.</p>
<p>However, other games do not seem to exhibit this behavior. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>God of War Ragnarok</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li>Immortals of Aveum</li>
<li>Dragon's Dogma 2</li>
</ul>
<p>What's even more interesting is that some of these games are powered by the same engines seen in the first group. For example, Dragon's Dogma 2 runs on CAPCOM's RE Engine just like Resident Evil 4, but the latter is impacted, and the former is not. Having said that, Digital Foundry noted that it's not unthinkable that some of these games could still suffer from the issue, albeit only after playing them after longer than half an hour.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the stuttering issue seemed to go away for a while after switching to another input (for example, PC) and back. Of course, that's not a proper fix, which can only come from Sony or the developers, depending on whether it is a system-wide issue or a game-specific issue.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we'll let you know if Sony acknowledges the problem and provides an ETA on its resolution.</p>
