			<p>Digital Extremes has revealed major <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-early-access-begins-later-this-year-overworld-is-larger-than-warframes-open-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulframe</a> news at TennoCon 2025. Preludes, the Pre-Alpha version of the game, will be opened to public access for everyone who signs up <a href="http://www.soulframe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> by July 20 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time. They'll continue to have access until the game's full public launch. After the open sign-up period ends, players can still sign up but will be placed in a queue until additional access becomes available.</p>



<p>Geoff Crookes, Creative Director of Soulframe, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Over a year now of players going hands-on with Soulframe in our Preludes pre-alpha builds, we’ve learned so many lessons and built a lot of new features for us as a studio. After last TennoCon, we put a huge amount of effort into improving combat fluidity and continued that passionate work into exploring brand new features like player social hubs, asynchronous player messaging with World Trees, among so many other additions. Today, we shared what the latest additions to our next Preludes build would be and beyond. We promise to all existing and future players to keep trying new things outside our comfort zone and work with you to create something we’ve all been looking for.</em></p>



<p>Combat has been significantly improved since last year, with smoother and more grounded fights. Movement and stagger have been overhauled, and a new "Smite" critical hit that allows "soul stealing" from enemies has been implemented. Bows have been reworked as well, and a new "Combat Arts" system, where packs and weapons level up through combat to unlock unique arts, is being introduced. More weapons will be added, including a two-handed axe.</p>



<p>The gameplay demo from TennoCon 2025 also showed new content and features coming to Soulframe.  A new fable, "The She-Wolf Snared," which is Orgal's fable, has been added. Playing it allows players to get their own puppy. New time-based festivals, including the "Festival of the Circade" and "Akfolmar" (a spooky season event), have been introduced. Improvements have been made to the Sparrow's Tale system, an in-game mission system now tied to factions, offering greater variety in mission types. The new player experience has been improved, too, with the game now starting with a choice to pick an alignment (Spirit, Courage, or Grace), which is connected to one of three enclaves in their faction system (Alchemist's Children, Kith and Kin, and Silent Rose).</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players will soon find a new enemy, the Wazzard of Wastes, who is the source of the rot in the heart of the Galvinar Swam. Furthermore, this magical mini-boss offered a new perspective on Magick-focused combat in Soulframe, showing off a new parry feature that can reflect projectiles back at the corrupt thaumaturge. After an initial tease, TennoCon 2025 attendees and viewers were even treated to the next Omen Beast boss fight: Bromius. Players will explore the underground realm of the Neath’uns, which is full of corrupted Sproutfolk and environmental puzzles that hinder the rehabilitation of the mutated, three-headed Bromius from the sinister whispers within the dark, tainted sap.</p>



<p>The Soulframe development team then showcased the first set of hairstyles available for players to customize their Envoy. Eight different hairstyle cosmetics are in production, and additional customizations for Envoys are still to come. More interestingly, the Soulframe team presented a customizable approach to combat techniques and skill progression that can be tailored to individual playstyle preferences. Offensive and defensive build options can be mixed and matched, including close-range melee focused on creating space with dodges and ranged damage that can close the gap with timed parries. Other combinations include more supportive roles. This progression approach allows players to tailor their Envoy's strengths to their preferred playstyle. It also adds to situational party compositions when playing cooperatively with others across various encounters.</p>

			<p>It seems like the Battlefield 6 reveal event may be very close, at last. Content creator Doom49 reported (as screengrabbed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-reveal-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Insider Gaming</a>) having received a promotional package this week, and rivaLxfactor <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946400245388038395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> a few more details:</p>



<p><em>I have confirmed with another person that there is a 3 day event at the end of July for EA which will include the live reveal of Battlefield 6. It will be much like the BF1 event, with players getting a live round in after the devs speak and video is showcased.</em></p>



<p>This is, perhaps, why EA Games won't be at Gamescom 2025, as their PR agency confirmed to Wccftech. They're going to have their own event, possibly on Tuesday, July 29, and, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/datamine-leak-ea-battlefield-6-open-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by a datamined leak</a>, there might be a public open beta not too long afterward.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has been in development for several years, with four studios contributing to the project:</p>



<ul>
<li>Franchise creator and caretaker DICE</li>



<li>Motive Studios (Star Wars: Squadrons, Dead Space Remake), which is working on the single player campaign</li>



<li>Criterion Games, which is working on both single player and multiplayer</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-dev-dice-la-rebrands-ripple-effect-studios-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple Effect Studios</a>, which worked on Battlefield 2042's Community Portal</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to a report</a> from early July, Electronic Arts has lofty goals for Battlefield 6: it seeks to reach a hundred million players, which would be by far the franchise record. The report also hinted at a $400 million budget, one of the largest in the history of gaming, and various development troubles. </p>



<p>One thing is for sure: Battlefield 6 cannot fail like 2042 and, to a lesser extent, Battlefield V did. To that end, EA should ensure that the game is polished enough before making it to launch. Officially, we only know that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released before the end of EA's fiscal year</a>, which is to say before the end of April 2026.</p>
