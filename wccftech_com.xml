			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza, a new entry in the series starring one of Nintendo's most iconic characters besides Mario, is launching in a few months on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The new 3D platformer will be released on July 17th, a little over a month after the next-generation Nintendo console debuts worldwide on June 5th. While not a lot of information is currently available on the game, the trailer shown during today's Nintendo Direct provided a decent overview of what to expect, including a new design for Donkey Kong clearly inspired by the successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie, a colorful and lively experience that looks heavily inspired by Super Mario Odyssey.</p>

<p>With the announcement of Donkey Kong Bananza, 2025 is looking increasingly like the year of Donkey Kong. Back in January, Nintendo brought one of the best entries in the series, Donkey Kong Country Returns, to Nintendo Switch, complete with improved visuals that make it a worthwhile purchase for those who have never experienced the game before, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</em></p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th worldwide.</p>

			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> presentation was a wave of new information about Nintendo's hotly anticipated console, and some of the first-party Nintendo games that will be available on the console either at launch, or later this year.</p>
<p>We also got confirmation for a number of third-party titles that will be available on the Nintendo Switch 2, including Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Hades 2, Hitman: World of Assassination, Hogwarts Legacy, Star Wars: Outlaws, and more.</p>
<p>Some of these games are classified as specific editions, like how Elden Ring for Nintendo Switch 2 isn't just called "<em>Elden Ring</em>," but instead is called "<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition,</em>" which in the case of Elden Ring signifies that this version of the game will include the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion.</p>
<p>The Tarnished Edition will also include new customizations for Torrent, new weapons, and new armor, when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>Some of the games confirmed were also brand new announcements, like a new FromSoftware game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a>, or Enter the Gungeon 2. We also got a reiterated confirmation that Hollow Knight: Silksong is indeed planned to release sometime later in 2025.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition however, has been confirmed to launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p>
<p>But on the note of release dates, we don't know when each of these games will release, as some of them came with specific release dates, while others just had a release window for 2025, and others still had no release date attached to them at all.</p>

			<p>A new game by FromSoftware called The Duskbloods is coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2 next year.</p>
<p>Announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, the next game by the renowned development studio will be a brand-new multiplayer title sporting a rather eerie setting and atmosphere not too different from Bloodborne's and a deep dive into what feels like a vampire-themed story, so much so that the game almost feels like a new entry in the Castlevania series. Sadly, details are scarce at the moment, but judging from the trailer below, it seems like the game will share some similarities with Elden Ring: Nightreign, especially regarding characters' mobility. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn more about the game, as a developer diary series called Creator's Voice featuring director Hidetaka Miyazaki will be coming on April 4th.</p>

<p>Before The Duskbloods launches next year exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, although it will likely be a timed exclusive, FromSoftware will release the aforementioned Elden Ring: Nightreign next month on PC and consoles. You can learn more about the multiplayer game featuring roguelike mechanics set in the same world of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">2022 Game of the Year</a>, which is also launching on Nintendo Switch 2, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">hands-on preview</a> of the closed beta.</p>
