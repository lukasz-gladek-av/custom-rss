			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched yesterday, at the time of this writing, and in what seems to be a required milestone in the launch of any major title, it has done so with a number of performance issues. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">a new statement</a> from developer Leenzee Games, the studio acknowledges the reports it has received from players regarding performance problems and a few other issues with "<em>abnormal pricing</em>" and pre-order errors.</p>



<p>After thanking players who have supported the game and were there to play it on launch, Leenzee Games wrote that it has "<em>received reports regarding issues such as the game’s optimization not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>These problems should never have occurred,</em>" it continued, "<em>and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games adds that it is "<em>confident in the game's performance</em>" so long as your PC is within the studio's recommended technical specifications, but it is working on optimizing the game for the variety of PC builds out there. It also confirms that a patch is being worked on, and that Leenzee will release it "<em>as soon as we can</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games also quickly touches on "<em>pricing anomalies</em>" in some regions where the game is being sold, and just says that it is trying to work with Steam to ensure that the correct price is listed in every region. </p>



<p>Lastly, Leenzee Games addresses reports of players not getting promised pre-order rewards, an issue it also says will be fixed in its next patch. And as a sign of appreciation for its players, everyone who purchased the game on Steam is getting a free copy of the game's soundtrack. If you bought the deluxe version of the game on Steam, then you'll also be getting a brand-new costume in a future update, as another token of the studio's appreciation for your support.</p>



<p>A free copy of the soundtrack and new in-game cosmetics is nice and all, but what players want is for the game they purchased to run smoothly. Of the 8,000+ player reviews for WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">only 21% of them are positive</a>, with pretty much every negative review citing major performance problems. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">Francesco De Meo looked at WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers for his review</a>, he also cited performance issues as a key drawback of the game, and while it has a strong art style and some engaging combat elements, the performance problems aren't the only things players have to worry about in Fallen Feathers. </p>



<p>"<em>Uninspired level design, mediocre PC performance and a formula that relies a little too much on the genre's conventions hold the experience back a bit, making it worthwhile only for fans of the genre who haven't had enough of it, and are willing to look past some shortcomings.</em>"</p>
