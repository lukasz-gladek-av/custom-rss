			<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel codenamed Project Orion is going to feature a second city to explore besides Night City, according to information provided by the creator of the Cyberpunk universe.</p>
<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/cyberpunk-2077-tworca-potwierdza-nowe-miasto-w-kontynuacji-to-chicago-ktore-poszlo-w-zla-strone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD-Action</a>, Mike Pondsmith recently talked with TVGRY during the Digital Dragon 2025 event, revealing that, while he is not as involved in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel as he was with the original game, he gets to see scripts, check out new cyberwar, and talk with the various departments at work on the game, including the environment design people. From these people, he probably learned that the second entry in the series will feature a second city besides Night City, which he described as having the feel of "Chicago gone wrong", rather than the Blade Runner-inspired atmosphere of Night City. While unable to share more, Mike Pondsmith added that he sees this city working for the game, so it will definitely be interesting to see how it will fit in the story and the universe.</p>
<p>Though we probably won't see the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion anytime soon, the franchise by CD Projekt Red entered the spotlight once again last month, when a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game was announced alongside the Nintendo system. Despite the technical differences with the other consoles, the port seems to be holding up quite well and could offer a much better on-the-go experience than the Steam Deck, judging from some <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">recent comparisons.</a> With CD Project Red putting so much <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">effort</a> into the port, including the entirety of the game on the retail edition's cartridge, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game become one of the most popular Nintendo Switch 2 launch releases.</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Project Orion, is currently in development for yet-to-be-announced systems. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>
