			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-reportedly-headline-februarys-ps-plus-extra-games/">Leaked earlier in the week by Dealabs</a> and confirmed at yesterday's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, the latest web-swinging adventure from <strong>Insomniac Games</strong>, 2023's <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</strong> is the headlining title for the February 2026 batch of <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong> games entering the Game Catalog. It enters the library of games that players have access to through their subscription, alongside <strong><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-february-marvels-spider-man-2-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-neva-season-a-letter-to-the-future-and-more/">eight other games</a></strong>, including several of the more notable indie releases from the last few years.</p>



<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 wasn't the only game that was leaked ahead of this batch's official confirmation. <strong>Neva</strong> and <strong>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</strong> were also part of the leak, with the remaining seven games being surprises. </p>



<p>All of the games entering the PS Plus Extra Game Catalog this month will be available as of <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>. Of the nine joining the library, <strong>four</strong> of them are indie titles that you should take the time to check out if you've not played them before, particularly if you're a fan of strong narrative storytelling. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/venba/"><strong>Venba</strong>,</a> Neva, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/season-a-letter-to-the-future/"><strong>Season: A Letter to the Future</strong>,</a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/echoes-of-the-end-review/">Echoes of the End</a></strong> are all indie games worth checking out, especially as games you can play as part of a larger subscription.</p>



<p>While Echoes of the End may be the weakest of the bunch in terms of its narrative chops, it does have more action-focused gameplay and a few puzzle mechanics that could keep you intrigued. This version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-the-end-enhanced-edition-free-update-improves-combat-and-more/">is also a much better one than what we played at launch</a> when we reviewed it, where it still featured several glaring technical and design issues. </p>



<p>Two other notable entries in this month's batch are the first two <strong>Monster Hunter Stories</strong> titles, which arrive just in time for anyone who has been intrigued by trailers for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a></strong> but missed the first two games.</p>



<p>As for PS Plus Premium subscribers, they are only getting one game in this batch of releases, which is <strong>Disney Pixar's Wall-E</strong>, a game made by <strong>Asobo Studio</strong> that first arrived on the PlayStation 2 back in 2008.</p>

            <guid>1435501</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>SEGA</strong> has just released its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/en/ir/">third-quarter financials</a> for its current fiscal year, and while some of its numbers don't look as strong as the company may have hoped, like having to incur <strong>$200 million</strong> <strong>impairment</strong> by devaluing <strong>Rovio</strong>, the <strong>Angry Birds</strong> maker that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-buys-angry-birds-rovio-to-expand-in-mobile/">acquired back in 2023</a>, its future outlook has a lot for players to look forward to.</p>



<p>In the segment of its presentation regarding its initiatives for the next fiscal year, SEGA lists that it plans "<em>to release four major new titles for mainstay IPs</em>." The next fiscal year will take us all the way to <strong>March 2027</strong>, which means that if SEGA can hit its goal, it will have <strong>four new games</strong> from its <strong>biggest franchises</strong> on shelves for players to grab.</p>



<p>Outside of a new <strong>Sonic</strong> game looking to <a href="https://wccftech.com/did-you-like-frontiers-leaker-teases-next-sonic-game-as-community-pleads-for-more-than-just-sonic-on-generic-ue5-terrain/">follow up <strong>Sonic Frontiers</strong></a>, which has not yet been officially announced, the upcoming games we know about from SEGA that don't yet have a release date include: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-the-game-awards/">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/total-war-medieval-iii-is-in-early-development-warcore-engine-announced/">Total War: Medieval III</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027/">Persona 4 Revival</a></strong>.</p>



<p>There's also the question of the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">Virtua Fighter Project</a></strong>, the upcoming sequel to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-sequel/">Alien: Isolation</a></strong>, and SEGA's efforts to reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/"><strong>Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, </strong>and <strong>Shinobi</strong></a>. And, of course, we're also still waiting on news for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-6-release-logo/">Persona 6</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Save for a few obvious franchises like Sonic, Persona, and Virtua Fighter, it's unclear what SEGA is referring to when it talks about "<em>mainstay IPs</em>." After having to write down Rovio and seeing a <strong>54.6%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in its operating income and a <strong>51.8%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in its ordinary income due to recent releases falling short of expectations, SEGA knows it needs its next batch of releases to hit a little higher.</p>



<p>It all comes down to what could be ready and what it believes will be the game to set it on that path to commercial success. If we really do have a flurry of major SEGA games coming from now until March 2027, then we'll hopefully know more about SEGA's plans soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance Next-Gen Update Delivers A ‘Performance Leap With Up to 60FPS, Ultra-Quality Settings’ On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ]]></title>

			<p>Although a little <strong>rough around the edges</strong>, the original <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> managed to carve out its niche with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the most immersive medieval open-world role-playing games ever</strong>, making it easy for many fans of the genre to look past its <strong>technical shortcomings</strong>, especially on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>



<p>From today, however, even console players will be able to enjoy the first entry in the series by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhorse Studios</strong> at its best, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/"><strong>previously rumored</strong></a> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Next-Gen Update</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">now out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Announced during today's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Warhorse Studios Anniversary Celebration Stream</strong>, the Next-Gen update allows players to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"experience Henry's journey like never before,"</em> delivering a <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)">significant performance boost with up to 60 frames per second, ultra-quality settings from the PC version, improved visual assets</strong> and<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> </strong><strong>1440p resolution upscaled to 4K resolution output.</strong></p>



<p>Though short, the launch trailer below does a good job showing how much the game has been improved for current-generation consoles, and with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">cross-generation save transfers</strong>, returning to 15th-century Bohemia will be easier than ever. All existing owners can also download the update <strong>for free.</strong></p>

<iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Next-Gen Update - Launch trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_gLXjKFYQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While the high-quality settings and improved assets are welcome, the biggest improvement in the <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> Next-Gen Update is the <strong>improved framerate</strong>. Previous generation consoles <strong>struggled to run the game at 30 FPS</strong>, and with massive drops in cities and with some weather conditions, such as rain, it was difficult for most not only to get immersed in the game's setting but also to just enjoy an adventure that still deserved to be played, despite its issues.</p>



<p>All of the issues found in the original have been addressed in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. Released last year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, <strong>Henry of Skalitz's second adventure is a memorable one, by all accounts</strong>. "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original,"</em> wrote Chris Wray in our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">10/10 review.</a></strong></p>
