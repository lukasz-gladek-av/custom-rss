			<p>A new datamine points from <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981402959180427611">X (formerly Twitter) user ModernWarzone</a> points to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/">the battle royale mode</a> for Battlefield 6 shadow-dropping next week when the game's Season 1 update arrives on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, the new mode which is codenamed "<em>Granite</em>" will be fully revealed first on October 27 with a trailer before it goes live the next day on October 28. It's worth noting that we've heard nothing concrete from EA and Battlefield Studios about when the battle royale mode will arrive, and that it has not been included in any promotional materials for the game's Season 1 roadmap.</p>

<p>According to ModernWarzone, this is partly due to EA not wanting to immediately pull focus away from Battlefield 6's core offering, its multiplayer modes. If that's true, then that's likely because the coming battle royale will be free-to-play and likely a separate offering compared to the core Battlefield 6 game. Essentially, it'll be just like how you can play Call of Duty: Warzone for free, but to jump into the multiplayer for the new annual Call of Duty release, you'll have to buy the latest entry.</p>



<p>Just yesterday from the time of this writing, Wccftech and several other media outlets <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">shared hands-on impressions with the Season 1 content set to arrive next week</a>, including the new maps and game modes, the first batch of which arrives on October 28, the second on November 18, and the third on December 9.</p>



<p>The new maps both look stunning and like they'll be solid additions to Battlefield 6, but the new game modes, both the permanent one arriving next week and the limited-time mode coming in November failed to impress, and at least in their current state, are rather stale and boring.</p>



<p>If this battle royale mode does arrive next week, then that certainly gives Season 1 a huge boost compared to what it already has available. </p>
