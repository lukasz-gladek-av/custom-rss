			<p>Steam's Winter Sale is now over, and according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most">the latest report from Alinea Analytics,</a> PC players are going to be spending their time playing ARC Raiders while they wait for the next store-wide sale for the platform this Spring.</p>



<p>December 2025 was the best December for Steam yet, with the platform generating<strong> over $1.6 billion</strong> last month. It was a <strong>22.7% increase</strong> compared to December 2024, and it handily beat December 2020's COVID-era numbers when Steam brought in a gross revenue of $1.4 billion.</p>



<p>As for what drove that record-breaking gross revenue? ARC Raiders, the third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios that continues to be the 'game of the hour' after its massive launch in October 2025, was a big part of that success. Since it hit the market, it has barely slowed down, just recently having reached over <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/">12 million copies sold</a></strong> overall. On Steam alone, Alinea estimates it has sold over <strong>7 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>Over the holidays, ARC Raiders was the second-best-selling game on Steam by revenue. It sold over 250K copies on Boxing Day, and its concurrent player counts show no sign of the game leaving the top-played games on Steam anytime soon. At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">it has yet to fall below 250K concurrent players on Steam since it launched</a>. </p>



<p>As for which game took the number one spot in terms of revenue, that went to Counter-Strike, which is what you'd expect from the game that constantly remains the most played game on the platform.</p>

<p>The charts for Steam's December 2025 get more interesting when you look at copies sold, as they directly point out the value of a good deal. Detroit: Become Human was 90% off during the Winter Sale, making it less than the price of a latte at Starbucks. At that price, approximately <strong>993K</strong> players who hadn't bought it before took their chance, and it was the second-best-selling game, behind ARC Raiders, for December 2025.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Battlefield 6, which was 30% off during the Winter Sale, and Slay the Spire, which was also at an all-time low at 90% off during the Winter Sale. Good timing for developer Mega Crit, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">getting prepared to launch Slay the Spire II later this year, in March 2026</a>. </p>



<p>When ARC Raiders arrived in October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto gave it a 9/10 in his review,</a> writing, "<em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em>"</p>

			<p>If you think the problem with video games these days is that everyone plays the same five games all the time, which makes publishers more wary of taking risks, and instead of getting new, creative and innovative games, we get more of the same, then <strong>Circana</strong> analyst and executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> just gave you some fuel for that argument, as the numbers for the top-five played games in 2025 on PlayStation and on Xbox were the same as the top-five games played on both platforms in 2024.</p>



<p>They're even almost in the exact same order, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">Piscatella reports on Bluesky</a>, with the top five played games in the US on PlayStation, as ranked by percentage of active players, are:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Roblox</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>
</ol>



<p>On Xbox, the list is:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fortnite</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>All five games are on the list for the most-played games on either platform in 2024, with the PlayStation 2024 list not changing at all, and the only difference on the Xbox 2024 list being that Call of Duty and Fortnite swap places, as do Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto V. But it's still the same five games, seemingly consuming everyone's time on consoles in the United States.</p>







<p>Piscatella followed the news up by saying, "<em>Things are a bit...established...at the top</em>." He also claimed that a more detailed report, including the top-selling games in 2025 in the US, overall and by platform, will arrive on January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>Any new game's biggest competitor is Fortnite, Call of Duty, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, and Roblox. Those are <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-biggest-competitor-threat-video-games-industry/">the five games that are dominating the industry,</a> and the reason why new games have a tough time gaining any traction.</p>



<p>Those are also five free-to-play games (Call of Duty: Warzone), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">as Piscatella has reported before,</a> US consumers are likely to spend less on video games as tariffs and the rising cost of living continue to impact their discretionary spending. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">2025 might've been the year of indies</a> controlling the conversation and the awards, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight Silksong, Blue Prince, etc, but those are not the games that keep the industry moving. </p>



<p>So if you're the person complaining that we keep getting the same kinds of games over and over again, or that publishers aren't greenlighting new titles for fear that they'll get swallowed up by 'the big five,' then vote with your wallet where you can, and maybe spend a little more time <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">in the 'indies' section of Steam</a> instead of on Fortnite. It won't be much, but at an individual level, it's one of the best things you can do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Back in December 2025, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/"><strong>CES 2026</strong> really kicked off</a>, ASUS invited Wccftech and other members of the press to downtown Toronto for a sneak preview at what ASUS would be bringing to the coming show in Las Vegas. It was an afternoon packed with information and a look at ASUS's lineup of 2026 products, and as you might imagine, there were more than a few intriguing devices shown off.</p>



<p>That said, everything that was in the showroom that day and all of the tech that is currently descending on Las Vegas comes with a cloud hanging over it: <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/"><strong>memory shortages</strong></a>. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/">shortage is threatening</a> (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">in some ways, already succeeding</a>) to send the entire tech world into disarray, which honestly makes it difficult to get excited about anything coming from ASUS or any other tech hardware manufacturer.</p>



<p>Even with the gloomy realities of the world creeping around every new device that was shown off, I was still able to find a few items that stood out to me as what to look forward to, and what might actually be worth saving up for, if you're in the market for some of the latest and greatest tech.</p>



<p>I also got the chance to speak with <strong>Sascha Krohn, </strong>global director of technical marketing at ASUS, about the company's 2026 lineup and what it's bringing to CES. <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">You can check out that interview here</a>.</p>



<p>Some housekeeping, these picks are just what stood out to me based on their specs, what actually seems exciting about the device, and how I'd be interested in using it. I only got to spend an afternoon getting up close and personal with these devices, and I'm not at CES 2026 personally, so these won't be hands-on impressions. We're sure to learn more about these devices as CES 2026 kicks off, so <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ces/">check out our full coverage of the showcase here for more</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rog-g1000-the-outrageous">ROG G1000 - The Outrageous</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-G1000-ASUS-CES-2026-Preview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The ROG G1000 at the ASUS CES 2026 Toronto Preview.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are always a few products that make their way to CES that aren't ever going to make it to consumers, and are just expensive showpieces for the show floor. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-g1000-flagship-rog-gaming-desktop-anime-holo-holographic-fans-420mm-aio/"><strong>ASUS ROG G1000</strong></a> straddles the line between a product that's actually going to be available to consumers and something that is better suited as a showpiece for CES.</p>



<p>It's that duality that makes it an impressive machine that can be easy to get excited for, with holographic fans and three-zone cooling. The fact that the chassis is so big, you can fit practically any component you want in there, not to mention ASUS's mandate that only the top-of-the-line hardware gets anywhere close to meeting this tower's standards.</p>



<p>After all, what else would you expect from the flagship ROG desktop in ASUS's 2026 lineup? But unless you have the storage space and, more importantly, the wallet space, the G1000 might as well be one of those impossible products you see at CES that you know you'd never actually get to try unless you were on the show floor. </p>



<p>It's cool and exciting to have a holographic fan and to see an LED show on steroids going on in your PC at all times, but with the price of all tech products in fluctuation, the G1000 may live up to its "<em>Built to be Seen</em>" tagline more than ASUS would like, as all we can do is 'see' it through our own computer screens without a hope of actually getting to see one at our desks while playing the latest release at max settings.</p>

<h2 id="h-rog-zephyrus-g16-the-respectable">ROG Zephyrus G16 - The Respectable</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ROG-Zephyrus-G16-ASUS-CES-2026-Preview-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ROG Zephyrus G16 2026 at the ASUS CES 2026 Toronto preview.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This entry comes with a fair share of bias, because I bought an ROG Zephyrus G15 laptop back in 2021, and it's been an incredible piece of kit for me since day one. It's easy for me to get excited about the ROG Zephyrus G16 because it's a better version of a laptop I already love, so take my recommendation of it with that in mind.</p>



<p>As someone who has been working and gaming on an older model in the Zephyrus line of laptops, what stands out to me about the 2026 G16 is how ASUS redesigned the cooling structure for the device, as I've found my current model to run hotter than I'd like while gaming. That's a personal highlight based on my own experience with my older laptop, but the undeniable highlight of the 2026 G16 model is its Nebula HDR OLED display panel.</p>



<p>At 2560x1600 and 240Hz, and up to 1000 Nits, this will undoubtedly be one of the best displays on a laptop this year. It'll be so crisp it might actually distract you long enough that you forget about the memory shortages for a few fleeting moments.</p>

<h2 id="h-rog-zephyrus-duo-the-innovative">ROG Zephyrus Duo - The Innovative</h2>

<p>I know devices like the Zephyrus Duo and Zenbook Duo aren't anything brand new. It's not exactly innovative to be putting out yet another version of a device we've already seen before. But to me, if the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-g16-g14-laptops-next-gen-intel-amd-upgrades-dual-3k-oled-stunning-designs/">ROG Zephyrus Duo 2026</a></strong> ended up becoming the best dual-screen laptop so far, that would be innovative enough, because I truly believe dual-screen laptops are the future of laptops overall.</p>



<p>I don't think we'll be abandoning the kinds of laptops we've all been used to for decades, but I do see Duo laptops becoming the 'everything device' for the next generation. It's a tablet when you want it to be, without losing any of the features you get from a full laptop. You can fold it any which way you need whether you're relaxing by watching something online or if you're making a presentation to a group of people. </p>



<p>It's got two standout Nebula HDR OLED displays, all the ports you'd want with little need for any adaptor dongles, and it's got power to spare, especially if you get the model that is spec'd out below with an RTX 5090 and Intel's latest Panther Lake CPUs.</p>



<p>I don't necessarily need a new laptop, but if I did, the Zephryus Duo is what I would try to save my pennies for.</p>

<p>Lastly, the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 Kojima Productions collaboration stood out because it is just plain cool. Yes, it is last year's ROG Flow Z13; the hardware inside isn't anything new, but even with that in mind, it's tough to say 'no' to a laptop designed by Yoji Shinkawa and Hideo Kojima. </p>



<p>The hardware won't take you as far as even some of ASUS's more budget-friendly laptops from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-zenbook-a16-fastest-qualcomms-snapdragon-x2-laptop-proart-pz14-zenbook-a14-vivobook-s16-unveiled/">Vivobook</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-amd-ryzen-ai-max-ryzen-ai-400-mainstream-tuf-gaming-a14-laptops/">TUF Gaming </a>lines will, but those don't come with Yoji Shinkawa's brush stroke.</p>
