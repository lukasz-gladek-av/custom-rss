			<p>With the video games industry being ever more averse to taking risks and launching new IPs, last year's release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> was a breath of fresh air. While the game developed and published by CAPCOM failed to set the sales charts on fire, the tower defense-meets-action game was, by every metric, a fine game that deserved more recognition and success, which the soon-to-be-released Nintendo Switch 2 port could bring, considering the experience is sure to work well in handheld format and with mouse controls. The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess will also feature a new play mode called Otherworldly Ventures, which is also coming to other versions of the game to provide better replay value.</p>
<p>The Otherworldly Ventures mode is a sort of replayable "endless" mode with some light roguelike elements powered by a more streamlined version of the game's formula set in the same locations seen in the campaign, but with rearranged elements. Villagers, for example, don't have to be rescued; crystals are much easier to come by; contraptions, barriers, and other structures are located in different places than in the original maps, and can be repaired instantly; Soh doesn't have to guide Yoshiro to purify gates, only protect her. At the beginning of an Otherworldly Ventures run, Soh will come with limited abilities, and can only assign the roles of Woodcutter and Archer to the available Villagers, but after clearing a Seethe wave, it will be possible to pick one among a few available upgrades, including additional Rations, new Villagers, new Masks, higher defense, increased damage and so on. Items and new abilities can also be purchased during waves as well with enough crystals, providing players with every option they need to survive the night and take on the next wave. After enough waves have been completed, the stage will change, repeating the loop until the final stage, or Yoshiro's health has been depleted. In Hard difficulty mode, the Otherworldly Ventures mode can go on indefinitely, though waves will progressively become more challenging, as the health of any character is not replenished automatically. At the end of each run, the player's performance will be scored, accompanied by several rewards that provide some incentive to engage with the new play mode.</p>

<p>Though the new Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess play mode doesn't shake up the experience much, the faster pace makes the Otherworldly Ventures mode a fine addition to the game. And a rather challenging one to boot, as right from the onset, you will be dealing with powerful Seethe that only appear later in the campaign, so if you haven't played the game in a while, it will take some time to get back into the swing of things. After this happens, however, the new play mode becomes quite enjoyable, so much so that it could be difficult for some to return to the slower pace of the main campaign.</p>
<p>Twisting the main campaign's formula only slightly, and unlocking only after completing the campaign, the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Otherworldly Ventures mode is not going to change anyone's opinion on the game, as only those who liked it enough to complete the campaign will get to experience it. Still, it is a great way to put one's skills to the test, and a solid addition to an already solid game that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves.</p>
<p>The Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Otherworldly Ventures additional content will get added to the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S with a free update on June 5th, the same day the Nintendo Switch 2 port releases worldwide.</p>
<p><em>Tested on PC. Early access provided by the publisher.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've been hearing <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">for a while now</a> that a Persona 4 Remake was on its way, but now the game is all but officially confirmed by Atlus after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man</a> and Yosuke voice actor, Yuri Lowenthal, posted about not being asked back to reprise his role as Yosuke.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">In a post on Lowenthal's personal BlueSky account</a>, as a response to people who have been asking Lowenthal about the upcoming and not-yet-officially-confirmed remake, he wrote "<em>And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake. I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don't want me to come back</em>."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreif7qijwd43romugsgml5j2ee7gpah36vaz2lacnvrzogoyosqzygq">
<p lang="en">And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake. I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5?ref_src=embed">Yuri Lowenthal (@yurilowenthal.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r?ref_src=embed">2025-05-28T13:37:47.019Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So not only does Lowenthal seemingly confirm that the rumors about a Persona 4 remake coming have been true, he also confirms that, at least in his case and likely in the case of the rest of the original voice cast, Atlus is taking the same route it took for Persona 3 Reload and recasting the core characters in the game.</p>
<p>Considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-is-the-fastest-selling-game-in-the-franchise/">Persona 3 Reload's success</a>, it could be that the decision not to ask Lowenthal back came from Atlus trying to take the same steps it took with Persona 3 Reload to repeat that success with the Persona 4 Remake. We'll likely never know exactly why Lowenthal and potentially the rest of the voice cast aren't coming back, but Lowenthal's words seem to make it clear he's not too happy about the decision.</p>
<p>Regardless, hopefully, Persona fans don't have to wait too much longer to get the official confirmation we all know is coming. Summer Game Fest 2025 is around the corner, and there's always a good chance an announcement like this could appear at Keighley's big showcase.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-new-%E2%80%9Chigh-performance%E2%80%9D-mode-delivers-higher-fps-than-performance-mode-with-minimal-impact-on-image-quality.1200594/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-new-high-performance-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The custom NVIDIA DLSS 4 "High Performance" mode strikes a good balance between the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, delivering image quality on par with the latter with better performance.</p>
<p>A comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows games like Cyberpunk 2077, Oblivion Remastered, STALKER 2, The Witcher 3 next-gen and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running on an RTX 4070 at 1080p with the official NVIDIA DLSS 4 Performance and Ultra Performance mode and the "High Performance" mode which can be enabled in the NVIDIA App by setting the Ovrerride Super Resolution to 42% input resolution. The custom mode essentially delivers the same image quality as the vanilla Performance mode but with better performance in most of the tested games, and with noticeably better image quality in some games like The Witcher 3 next-gen over Ultra Performance mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="DLSS 4 New High Performance Mode - The Ultimate Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4070" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qNaG2ve5Uo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the release of the NVIDIA App earlier this year, it has become possible to tweak NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution with different input resolutions, giving users more control over how the upscaler behaves. Besides the "High Performance" mode showcased in the video below, the App also allows users to use the Ultra Quality mode that was added to the upscaler a while back but has never been properly implemented, allowing users to enjoy<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-ultra-quality-mode-better-perfromance-image-quality-dlaa/"> better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality.</a></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 officially launched together with the RTX 50 series GPUs, introducing a new Transformer model that delivers better image quality than the old CNN model, Multi Frame Generation for the latest RTX GPU generation and more. More information on these new features can be found <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
