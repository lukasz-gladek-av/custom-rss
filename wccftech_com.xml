			<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is now enhanced for the PS5 Pro, just a year after it was initially released on PS4 and PS5. Ubisoft Bordeaux has been working to release a patch for the game so that it will be enhanced for PS5 Pro when the console officially releases. To make it worth playing on the PS5 Pro, they've made some changes to how the game will run in both Quality and Performance mode on the PS5 Pro. Here is everything you can expect from the Assassin's Creed Mirage Enhanced patch.</p>
<p>Should you be picking up the game for the PS5 Pro, you will be able to play the game in 4K60 with PSSR as the upsampling software to provide "more faithful 4K details at 60 FPS." Quality Mode is now the default setting for the game at 60FPS rather than the 30FPS that it was for the original PS5 version of the game.&nbsp; The improvements have been showcased in a <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1854569510272905389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short video</a> that was posted by the official Assassin's Creed account on X.</p>
<p>As a whole, graphics are said to be generally improved, with better shadows and reflection fidelity, as well as higher texture resolution and improved draw distance. Whether this will be enough for people to pick up the game for the PS5 Pro remains to be seen.</p>
<p>While the Assassin's Creed franchise is quite expansive, when it comes to recent titles, Assassin's Creed Mirage wasn't as revered compared to other titles in the franchise, like Black Flag and Valhalla, for example. Despite this, Assassin's Creed Mirage was still the third best-selling retail game in Japan when it was released.</p>
<p>The main issue with Assassin's Creed Mirage was that people felt that the game was too short, and it is listed as one of the lowest-rated games in the franchise. Although it received a ton of positive buzz from critics when the game launched, it's tied for the third lowest-rated Assassin's Creed game in the whole series. Mirage tried to return to the stealthy roots of the fan favorites but didn't quite have the sparkle and charm that the original Assassin's Creed games had.&nbsp; You can read the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">review by Nathan Birch here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest Assassin's Creed game, named Assassin's Creed Shadows, was due for release on November 15 but has since been pushed back for a release on February 15, 2025. Despite not being out yet, the game has caused a significant stir in the community, and people have been actively trying to push for Ubisoft to either scrap the game or remake it entirely away from the story that they were initially trying to create.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Assassin's Creed Mirage for the PS5 Pro?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer.1030245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly three years since Deadline first <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Amazon was closing on a deal to adapt Mass Effect into a TV series for its Prime Video channel. Today, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> that the deal is finally done, featuring Daniel Casey as the writer and executive producer of the show. Casey is known primarily for the screenplay of 2018's Kin, a sci-fi feature film, and 2021's Fast &amp; Furious 9. Neither of which were exactly masterpieces, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyway, Variety also reports that Karim Zreik will executive produce under his Cedar Tree Productions banner. Ari Arad and BioWare's Michael Gamble will also executive produce. Zreik has worked on several successful TV series, such as Jericho and a plethora of Marvel shows (Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, Runaways, The Punisher, The Gifted, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Legion, and Helstrom). Ari Arad has produced several feature film adaptations, such as 2004's The Punisher, 2007's Ghost Rider, 2008's Iron Man, 2017's Ghost in the Shell, 2022's Uncharted, and 2024's Borderlands. Finally, Michael Gamble is a BioWare veteran who has worked on every Mass Effect game since the second. He is also leading the project for the next game installment and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that it would retain the photorealistic style and mature tone of the previous entries.</p>
<p>No details are currently available on the plot or on the casting. For Prime Video, this is yet another gaming adaptation. They've had massive success with Bethesda's Fallout, of course, and they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Like a Dragon: Yakuza last month. Amazon has two more heavy hitting gaming TV series on the way: <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>As for Mass Effect, today is N7 Day, so it's a good day for fans to get this near-announcement. There won't be much else, given that BioWare has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard, beyond a return of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-adds-cross-save-brings-back-mass-effects-normandy-on-n7-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
