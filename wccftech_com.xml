			<p>Developer and publisher Tripwire Interactive has released a new trailer for Killing Floor 3 ahead of its launch next week on July 24, 2025.</p>



<p>Technically, Killing Floor 3 should have been out for months by now. First announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-pc-ps5-xbox/">Gamescom 2023</a>, it was initially due to arrive on <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-assassins-creed-shadows-split-fiction-and-killing-floor-3-in-march/">March 25, 2025</a>. However, just a week into March, Tripwire Interactive announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">the shooter would be delayed</a>, and though it didn't reveal a new release date at the time, it promised it would arrive sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>Two months later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/">in May</a>, Tripwire confirmed that the delay would only last four months, with a new release date set for July 24, 2025. Today's new launch trailer seems to confirm that there won't be any more unexpected delays, and that players can look forward to jumping onto the killing floor next week with their friends regardless of platform, since Killing Floor 3 will support full crossplay between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, at launch.</p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 takes place 70 years after the events of Killing Floor 2, and in that time, Horzine has created a horde of monstrous creatures called Zeds. Now, Mr. Foster and the Nightfall crew are the only thing standing between the army of Zeds and the rest of the world.</p>



<p>If this trailer is to be believed, then Killing Floor 3 will be an explosive and action-packed game. We'll see how players respond to it when it arrives next week. </p>

			<p>The Epic Games Store has kicked off its new Summer Sale, which will run from today, July 17, to the end of the month on July 31, and while it'll feature a number of solid deals, its best deal is probably the fact that you can grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civ-vi-rise-and-fall-expanding-greatness/">Sid Meier's Civilization VI</a> for free.</p>



<p>Not just the base game for Civilization VI, mind you, but the Platinum Edition of the game, which includes its six DLC packs and two expansions. It's everything under the sun that's Civilization VI related, and the perfect deal for anyone who was perhaps unsure about jumping into Civilization VII.</p>



<p>It was made available for free starting today, July 17, and will only be available to grab until next week on July 24 at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST. So make sure to redeem it at some point in the week before then, to add it to your library and ensure you can download and play it through the Epic Games Store at any time in the future. </p>



<p>When it comes to what's not free on the EGS, some of the more notable deals include Red Dead Redemption 2 being 75% off and Cyberpunk 2077 being 60% off. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">Cyberpunk 2077 also recently got yet another significant update</a> from CD Projekt RED, making it once again another good time to jump into the game if you've not yet played it. </p>



<p>There are also a few notable games that came out this year that are on sale, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blades-of-fire-review-god-of-the-forge/">Blades of Fire</a> on sale for 20% off,  and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> on sale for 10% off. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Mortal Kombat II Movie Trailer Shows Johnny Cage In Action Ahead Of October Debut]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-mortal-kombat-ii-movie-trailer-shows-johnny-cage-in-action-ahead-of-october-debut.1246572/</guid>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">Warner Bros.</a> has debuted a new trailer for Mortal Kombat II, the upcoming sequel to the 2021 Mortal Kombat live-action film. The sequel is set to hit theatres this coming October 24, 2025, and today's trailer shows off plenty of action that the film will feature, specifically around a character who was absent in the 2021 movie, Johnny Cage.</p>



<p>Karl Urban is the one stepping into the role of Johnny Cage, who by the looks of it, will be the focus of the narrative of this film.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though, the real focus of anything Mortal Kombat, will always be the action, which this movie will hopefully have in spades. The trailer shows some of that, with Cage mostly dodging out of the way and discovering just how much he needs to punch above his weight if he wants to survive the tournament. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, we get to see more of Scorpion in action, as he slices Noob Saibot in half to close out the trailer. Which, admittedly, doesn't actually give the film the best setup it could, as the CGI doesn't look entirely clean.</p>



<p>But that could be due to a lot of things, and it's best to hold any final judgement until the film is actually out this October. Even if it's not able to deliver on a stronger story than the 2021 entry, hopefully, it will be able to deliver on more intense action, which was the strongest highlight of the 2021 movie.</p>
