			<p>October saw a lot of huge releases this month, including the highly-anticipated release of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, as well as games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Overall, the month saw a lot of huge releases, with a lot of them performing incredibly well and hitting major milestones for the franchise or developer.</p>
<p>When it comes to retail and digital games, it's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was on the top of the charts. Even though the exact number has not been confirmed by Activision or Treyarch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/">they have announced that this game</a> was the best-selling in the franchise thus far and crushed major milestones for the game. In addition, Circana has <a href="https://www.circana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had the most promotional volume, capturing 70 promotions for this game. It was promoted in stores like GameStop, with front-page coverage on websites like GameStop, Target, Walmart, and Amazon.</p>
<p>In terms of Twitch content, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a> remained on top for the month of October, as the semifinals of Worlds took place on October 27, which was the most-watched event. Peak concurrent viewership reached 1.64&nbsp; million viewers. While they didn't make the top five, both Silent Hill 2 and Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero debuted in the top 10 games, with Silent Hill 2 taking seventh place and Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero! Just about making it at number nine.</p>
<p>Another surprise was <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/">the massive success of Silent Hill 2</a>. While there were a lot of people who had faith that the game would be done well, Bloober Team has not had a stellar reputation in the past, leading a lot of hardcore Silent Hill fans to feel uncertain about the game. However, it did incredibly well, sold well, and has been nominated for multiple awards in different ceremonies. Additionally, Silent Hill 2 had 37 unique promotions, as captured by Circana. This comes as a surprise, considering the game has no Xbox Release. However, it's been confirmed by PlayStation that Silent Hill 2 was at the top of reorders, among the top games in the country, and among the top new games, with Steam promoting the game on its front page banner.</p>
<p>When it comes to retail, Sonic x Shadow Generations took the seventh place for unique promotions, and was one of two Sega titles in the top 10, with the other game being Metaphor: ReFantazio, another title that did incredibly well in sales and has been nominated for multiple awards.</p>
<p>October was a very stacked month, whereas November was relatively quiet and didn't have as many big titles. It's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was a major performer across a lot of categories in the Circana report.</p>
