			<p>EA is kicking off its first public beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> tomorrow, and even though the first two days of this weekend's beta is only open to players who were able to grab a code through Twitch or sent out to players that previously signed up to participate in Battlefield Labs, servers for the beta are already starting to fill up, as tens of thousands of players are queued up for the beta ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tens-of-thousands-of-players-are-queuing-for-the-battlefield-6-beta-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/">VGC</a>, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mj6s2e/the_hype_is_real/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> are sharing that the servers have already been maxed out, and there are thousands more waiting in the queue to get in, which means there are thousands who are keeping their devices on and ready, waiting in the game's lobby for the beta to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>At least for these coming beta weekends, it seems like EA won't need to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-include-bots-servers-arent-full-classic-maps-fan-feedback/">bots to fill the game's servers</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> is showing thousands of users currently in-game with a peak of 24,879 players earlier today. </p>



<p>Pre-loading the beta has been available to players since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">yesterday</a>, and with thousands already chomping at the bit to try out the next entry in the Battlefield series, it's clear that the caption on the above Reddit post is right. The hype is indeed real, for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Will it live up to the hype is another question all together. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">Last week's reveal</a> was a very promising show of the new shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto had plenty of positive things to say in his hands-on impressions,</a> saying "<em>this is exactly what I've wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs. While I know what I've experience during the multiplayer reveal event is only a small slice of the complete Battlefield 6 package, October 10th can't come soon enough.</em>"</p>

			<p>EA has revealed EA Sports NHL 26, which will once again not be coming to PC, and will only arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S when it launches on September 12, 2025. </p>



<p>This year's cover athletes also follows suit from last year's family focus, though instead of the Hughes brothers, it's the Tkachuk family who are being featured this year, with Matthew Tkachuk sharing the cover with brother Brady Tkachuk and their father Keith Tkachuk, who in his 18-year-long NHL career played for the St. Louis Blues, Winnipeg Jets, Atlanta Thrashers and the Phoenix Coyotes.</p>



<p>Unlike the reveal trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">EA Sports FC 26</a>, the reveal for NHL 26 features no direct gameplay, and makes no promising boasts that this year's entry will <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/">"<em>make gameplay better</em>."</a> It's instead more of what you'd expect from an annualized sports series, a flashy trailer that is chalk-full of sparks and sizzle but little substance as to what this year's entry will look like.</p>

<p>As far as what is supposedly different in this year's entry, the 'Be A Pro' mode has been "<em>revamped</em>" according to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250806397524/en/Think-Move-and-Play-Like-a-Superstar-in-EA-SPORTS-NHL-26-Powered-by-Official-NHL-Edge-Data">press release</a>, and is getting its "<em>biggest</em>" update since NHL 21, according to EA Sports creative director, Mike Inglehart. Inglehart also claims that EA Sports NHL 26 "<em>is the most true-to-life experience we've ever built</em>."</p>



<p>A new Goalie Crease Control System is also being introduced this year, aiming to make goalies "<em>more responsive, with smarter positioning and quicker, more natural saves</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding this year's new cover athletes, now back-to-back Stanley Cup champion and Florida Panther forward, Matthew Tkachuk, adds "<em>My dad, Brady and I are all unique and play the way we want to. Sharing the cover of NHL 26 is an extension of that. I've always tried to bring my own style to the ice, and seeing that captured in NHL 26 makes it feel like it is really me out there</em>."</p>



<p>Keith Tkachuk, who is gracing the cover of an NHL game more than a decade after he retired from the league, said that he is "<em>proud to be sharing the cover</em>" with his sons. Brady Tkachuk, brother to Matthew and captain of the Ottawa Senators,<em> </em>said "<em>it's an honor to be featured on the cover, and having him standing alongside us makes the whole thing even better</em>."</p>



<p>While it's nice for the Tkachuk brothers to share the milestone of making the cover of an NHL game with their father, fans of the series (myself included) can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by this reveal. The Be A Pro mode has been the exact same since NHL 21, and even the changes brought in that year's edition of the annualized series didn't exactly shake the hockey world to its core. </p>



<p>EA can talk about how it's been updated and "<em>revamped</em>" all it wants, but we'll need to see the changes before they can be believed. </p>
