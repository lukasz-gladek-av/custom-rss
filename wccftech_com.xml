			<p>Reliable insider billbil-kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 should launch on November 14, echoing the previous rumor shared by TheGhostofHope last month on X. Billbil-kun however added that there won't be a version of the Nintendo Switch 2, and there is no information on whether Activision Blizzard plans a later port of the game for the console.</p>



<p>The question arose within the Call of Duty community because back in February 2023, Microsoft, during its efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-contract-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a ten-year deal with Nintendo to bring the popular first-person shooter franchise to the Switch platforms. So far, no Call of Duty game has been released on Nintendo consoles. With the release of the Switch 2, it should certainly be easier to bring new titles to the freshly released hardware; after all, Black Ops 7 is also coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and it's been established that the Switch 2 is more powerful than Sony's and Microsoft's previous generation consoles. Still, there are clearly some hurdles to be overcome first.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will also be released in physical editions on consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X) at the price of €79.99. According to billbil-kun, pre-orders will be opened on Wednesday, August 20, right after Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live event. </p>



<p>The game itself is co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software. The campaign follows the events seen in 2012's Black Ops II. Ten years later, David Mason (voiced once again by Milo Ventimiglia) and his team of agents will pursue "a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else". Of course, there will also be plenty of multiplayer modes, including a round-based cooperative Zombies mode. When it comes to gameplay, the developers promised an evolution of the omnimovement system seen in last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

			<p>Just like every year around Gamescom, Berlin-based developer Elysium Game Studio has released a fresh trailer for their upcoming debut title, NEO BERLIN 2087.</p>



<p>The story of NEO BERLIN 2087, a first and third-person action roleplaying game, begins on a dark and ominous night in the German capital, which has been plunged into chaos following the brutal assassination of the police chief. The protagonist is Nolan (voiced by Elias Toufexis, the same actor behind Deus Ex's Adam Jensen), a detective with a troubled past who is given the daunting task of finding and protecting the police chief's daughter. She may hold the key to solving her father's murder. With state-of-the-art technology and weapons at his disposal, Nolan begins a perilous journey to find Natalie as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Eventually, with each new step, he grows closer to a sinister conspiracy that endangers him and the entire city. When Nolan finally meets the fiercely independent and resourceful Natalie, it becomes clear how their fates are intertwined in ways he could never have imagined. Their connection is a volatile mix of love, fear, and uncertainty. As they navigate the treacherous path ahead, they must confront their deepest fears and the shadowy forces threatening to tear them apart.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to Elysium Game Studio, the gameplay lets players customize Nolan's abilities and weapons to suit their preferred play style. They will be able to choose from a wide array of shooter, stealth, and RPG mechanics. NEO BERLIN 2087 is inspired by classic cyberpunk movies (Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell), albeit with a different city at its heart. Berlin in the year 2087 has become a cyberpunk metropolis shielded by massive walls from its devastated surroundings. There, outcasts gather, and malfunctioning machines roam the land. In the game, players will also explore the surrounding wasteland, which is full of dangerous enemies. They'll also get to test their reflexes in exciting combat sequences or, if they prefer, they may avoid confrontation entirely by adopting a stealthier approach.</p>



<p>NEO BERLIN 2087, which is powered by Unreal Engine technology, still doesn't have a release window. However, we know it will be available for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2326200/NEO_BERLIN_2087/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/neo-berlin-2087-500f0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series S|X. You can already add it to your favorite platform's wishlists.</p>

			<p>Vancouver-based game developer Blackbird Interactive has <a href="https://x.com/BBIgames/status/1956060573453705411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it has acquired the rights to the Hardspace: Shipbreaker IP from Focus Entertainment, which published the original game in 2022. Hardspace: Shipbreaker was well-received at launch; it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hardspace-shipbreaker-its-a-hardspace-life-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earned a 9/10 score here on Wccftech</a> from reviewer Rosh Kelly:</p>



<p><em>If you’re after a game to recover from the burnout and exhaustion of daily life in the 21st century, Hardspace offers a game that lets you lose yourself in satisfying, procedurally generated puzzles that are the ships that appear in your dock each and every ship. Whether you just want to listen to some ambient country music that calls into mind Firefly and other less problematic science fiction frontier stories, rip apart unique and detailed ships, or want to feel what it’s like to fight a massive company, win or lose, Hardspace: Shipbreaker is a fantastic game worthy of the fifteen hours or so it takes to complete.</em></p>



<p>Clearly, Blackbird Interactive feels there's much potential to expand the IP. Indeed, they have already announced that multiple games in the Hardspace: Shipbreaker franchise are in development.</p>



<p>At the same time, they have also unveiled the so-called LYNX Pioneer Program. Pre-registration <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is open on the official website</a> for users who would like to get:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exclusive early playtests of future Hardspace (and other BBI original IP) projects</li>



<li>Behind-the-scenes development updates and access</li>



<li>Opportunities to help shape BBI's next generation of games, participate in contests, and more</li>
</ul>



<p>Blackbird Interactive, a studio founded by former Relic Entertainment developers, has historically focused on strategy games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deserts-of-kharak-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak</a>, Crossfire: Legion, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homeworld 3</a>. However, it has found success with an unusual action/adventure simulation game. Still, one of these Hardspace projects could very well be a strategy game take on the IP, which would be interesting to see at some point.</p>
