			<p>The controversial GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, which includes the first three 3D entries in the series, was patched today on PC and consoles to bring over a highly requested change and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The patch</a>, which is now live on all PC storefronts, Xbox, and PlayStation, introduces the Classic Lighting Mode introduced in the mobile version of the collection last year. This mode restores the look and feel of the sky of the original games. To better highlight the differences between the vanilla lighting and the Classic Lighting Mode, Rockstar Games shared some comparison screenshots taken from the PC versions of all three games at maxed-out settings. You can check them out below.</p>

<p>Having not been updated in a long time, it seemed like Rockstar Games was done with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition patches, but thankfully, that was not the case, as the new Lighting Mode is a considerable improvement over the vanilla lighting. Some lingering issues still remain, but there's no doubt the remasters are in a much better state now than they were at release. You can learn more about these issues by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">launch review.</a></p>
<p>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices.</p>
