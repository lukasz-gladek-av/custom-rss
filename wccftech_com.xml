			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/">supposedly launching next year</a> is reportedly going to use a hybrid engine setup with Unreal Engine 5 and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine, as well as modern gameplay features and tweaked level design.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming"> Rebs Gaming</a>, who proved their reliability in the past by reporting correct information before official announcements, such as the launch date for Halo Infinite multiplayer component, reported some new details on the rumored remake, relied by an unnamed source who received it from a developer who works for a co-development studio which has previously worked with 343 Industries on the Halo: The Master Chief Collection and is now handling a lot of the remake's core development.</p>



<p>According to the new information, the current Halo Combat Evolved remake build features sprinting, which is not available in the original. Although the introduction of a modern FPS gameplay mechanic can be divisive, its inclusion would be hardly surprising, considering series co-creator Marcus Lehto talked about more contemporary core mechanics that improve gameplay among features of a potential remake that would enhance the original experience. Regarding gameplay, the remake is said to feature tweaked level design for maps like The Library.</p>



<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake will also reportedly be powered by two engines like this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, using Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay logic and world systems. This setup would ensure modern visuals and faithful gameplay, although using UE5 for graphics could lead to performance issues, as we have seen time and time again in way too many games released in the past few months, especially if <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-performance-issues-caused-development-process/">optimization work is not done properly, as suggested by Epic CEO last month</a></p>

<p>Although Rebs Gaming has proved to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new information, and even the development of a Halo Combat Evolved remake, with a grain of salt. Thankfully, it shouldn't take much longer to learn if the game is really in development, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo Studios will reveal the future of the series at HaloWC 2025 next month.</a></p>

			<p>Game developers have often criticized the Xbox Series S for its lower specifications, which made ports troublesome, but there have also been a few voices claiming the contrary. Recently, Ripple Effect <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Battlefield 6 was better optimized due to the development team's work to optimize the game for Microsoft's less expensive Xbox console.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with Windows Central</a>, Square Enix's programmer and director Naoki Hamaguchi has now said that the Xbox Series S has solid specs and his team did not encounter many issues with the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade port, except for the memory (the Series S has only 10GB of RAM).</p>



<p><em>In terms of hardware specs, I would say the Xbox Series S is actually quite solid in terms of spec. We didn't come across much of a processing challenge, but many of the challenges were more memory related. Optimization is something we were strongly cognizant of as we worked on the PC version as well. For Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we took some of the philosophies found in Nanite for Unreal Engine 5 and created our own solution for Unreal Engine 4. We were successful in delivering stable graphics there, and gained Steam Deck verification as well. We have been pretty proud of what we were able to achieve, even on lower spec systems.</em></p>



<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade port is coming to Xbox Series S and X as well as Nintendo Switch 2 on January 22, 2026. They also added that the whole trilogy will eventually be available on all main platforms (including PlayStation 5 and PC, of course). We don't know yet when Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will launch on Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2. We also do not know whether the third chapter in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy will launch simultaneously for all these consoles or still as a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive, as was the case with the first two installments.</p>

			<p>The new PlayStation 5 CFI-2100 model <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-digital-edition-revision-amazon/">released in Europe this month</a> may have a smaller SSD, but it introduces some welcome improvements, including one for a well-known <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">critical liquid metal cooling issue that has damaged plenty of systems already.</a></p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@austinevans">Austin Evans</a> takes a good look at the new hardware revision of Sony's current generation console, highlighting some changes over the previous models besides the inclusion of an 825 GB SSD over the 1 TB SSD of previous version of the system, which is a considerable downgrade for the Digital Edition of the system considering how much storage space games require nowadays.</p>



<p>The first notable change is purely aesthetic. The design of the new PlayStation 5 hardware revision remains identical to the current Slim design, but without the glossy finish. Although minimal, some may prefer this look, which is more in line with the launch models regarding the faceplates.</p>



<p>Every other change over the previous model is internal. Among the most notable changes are the inclusion of more NAND modules, three over the two of the earlier models, and ridges for the liquid metal cooling solution like those seen in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">PlayStation 5 Pro. </a></p>



<p>This addition is extremely welcome, as without those ridges, liquid metal can drip down if the console is placed vertically, causing dry spots on the APU, which can heavily compromise its functionality. Despite having had my launch model vertically since day one, I never had any of these issues as others did, so not every older model is affected by this problem. Still, these ridges are welcome additions that should ensure these systems stay functional longer.</p>



<p>The above changes are only some the new PlayStation 5 hardware revision offers. You can learn more about the reduced weight of the system and its better efficiency in the full teardown below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new base PlayStation 5 hardware revision, whose release in the United States is still uncertain, is reportedly being followed by a PlayStation 5 Pro revision. Little is known about this new model, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">changes are expected to be minimal.</a></p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds and its immediate predecessors Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise will drop Windows 10 support next month, CAPCOM confirmed today.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236777?l=english">new message on Steam</a> today, the Japanese publisher confirmed that starting October 14, 2025, CAPCOM will no longer guarantee the three games will run on Windows 10. While all three games will continue to be playable on Windows 10 systems, future system or game updates may make the games incompatible with the operating system. Additionally, support will only be provided based on information from before Windows 10 support was discontinued.</p>



<p>While this is unlikely to be an issue for Monster Hunter Rise and Monster Hunter World, as both games have stopped receiving new patches for some time, the end of Window 10 support for Monster Hunter Wilds, which coincides with Microsoft ending support for their older operating system, could be a problem, as the game is actively getting patched with fixes and updates, and its performance is still in dire need of improvement, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">it hasn't improved a lot since launch.</a></p>



<p>Speaking about new Monster Hunter Wilds updates, the latest entry in the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236233?l=english">getting a new Title Update today</a>, which introduces collaboration content with Final Fantasy XIV, including Omega Planetes as an additional monster, the Dark Knight Hunter armor and Pictomancy spells, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, which will be the target of a new event quest, and more.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During last week's Tokyo Game Show 2025, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-reveals-who-mysterious-hooded-character-is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer interviewed Resident Evil Requiem producer Masata Kumazawa</a>, who opened up about CAPCOM's issues with rumors and leaks for this game. Kumazawa-san admitted that fans get frustrated with the developers because of rumors or theories that the studio never really promised, and that, in turn, is frustrating for them.</p>



<p><em>Sometimes I talk to people and they act as if various speculation and rumours are just already a confirmed thing, and then they start talking on that basis. I would like everyone to remember, let's calm down a bit - what we've shown you so far is everything we can say. People get frustrated with us, because even though we didn’t promise things, the rumours and theories were such that they were widely believed.</em></p>



<p>Many of the rumors (mainly sparked by long-time CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem) are about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-remake-re-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged presence of Leon Kennedy in the game</a>, which CAPCOM has never really confirmed to this day. But there's also another hot topic: the hooded man seen in previous Resident Evil Requiem trailers, which fans are absolutely convinced is a returning character. However, Kumazawa confirmed that this was not the case.</p>



<p><em>Everyone is convinced that the hooded figure has to be a reveal of a returning cast member, and there is speculation that it ‘must be this person or must be that person’. But we don't always want to just lean on surprise comebacks like these. The hooded person is a new character, we will confirm that much. In this case, it's a newly created character for this storyline, so it's a bit of a previously undisclosed detail, but hopefully it contextualises how we’re approaching the game's story.</em></p>



<p>It won't be that long before players can verify for themselves what's true and what's not<span>&nbsp;since Resident Evil Requiem is slated to launch on February 27, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2 (which,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>based on off-scree</span>n footage from TGS</a>, is looking pretty good). On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is confirmed to support path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> for optimal visuals and performance.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-stunning-in-engine-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-iv-gets-stunning-in-engine-trailer-as-devs-talk-about-inspiration.1311169/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the PC Gaming Show - Tokyo Direct, KING Art and Deep Silver debuted a gorgeous in-engine trailer for the upcoming real-time strategy game Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV and shared some details about the game's inspiration. Originally announced at Gamescom 2025 and slated for a 2026 launch on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272360/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War_IV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>), the game will, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3u6jlJUEVI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Creative Director Jan Theysen</a>, follow in the footsteps of the first game in the franchise.</p>



<p><em>The first big decision, of course, was what we were aiming for. Do we try to do a Dawn of War 1 or 2 or a mix of both? We like both of them. But in the end, we said no, let's really go with Dawn of War 1; that's our guiding star. We talked to a lot of people: 'What do you remember from Dawn of War 1? What made it Dawn of War 1 for you?' And everybody was excited about sync kills. That was just something that everybody remembered, and so we said, okay, we definitely want sync kills in the game, but could we maybe even make it more spectacular or something that 20 years later is super cool? And so we came up with a new system.</em></p>



<p><em>I think when you do a new version or reinterpretation of a classic game, the challenge is always that you're not trying to recreate the old game, but you try to recreate the feeling that people had when they played the old game, right? What you basically want to do is you look at the old game, you ask yourself, okay, how did this work and how did this make us feel and how can we do this 20 years later?</em></p>



<p>Jan Theysen then discussed the developers' choices when it comes to the factions that will be featured in Dawn of War IV:</p>



<p><em>There are so many cool factions and so many cool stories you could choose from. We ended up picking the factions we picked because we felt if we do like a new version or an evolution of Dawn of War, you need the Blood Ravens and you need the Orks. That is just a given.</em></p>



<p><em>We thought about adding the Nekrons to Dawn of War IV because we felt that, you know, Nekrons were kind of promised for Dawn of War 3 and never came. So, it felt like a nice touch to finally give them to the players. There may be a faction that never had a big role in the Dawn of War games and there are not that many. The Adeptus Mechanicus is definitely a big and important faction in the 40K universe and they were never part of the Dawn of War franchise, so we felt that's a good opportunity to have something new for everyone.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As a reminder, the first three games were made by Relic Entertainment, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went independent from SEGA in March 2024</a> and is now working on a self-published turn-based strategy game called Earth vs Mars, <a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-announces-turn-based-strategy-game-earth-vs-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as announced in February 2025</a>.</p>



<p>As for KING Art, the German studio's last game was the real-time strategy game Iron Harvest, which launched in 2020. Our own Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/iron-harvest-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave it an 8 out of 10 score</a> back then.</p>
