			<p>New details about the upcoming Resident Evil film are starting to pour in. Just a few days ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-bird-star-joins-zach-creggar-resident-evil-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that actor Paul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai, Black Bird, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, The Naked Gun) would join the cast. Now, movie director Zach Cregger (Barbarian, Weapons) <a href="https://ew.com/resident-evil-movie-entirely-original-story-set-game-world-zach-cregger-exclusive-11812968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has spoken with Entertainment Weekly</a> about the adaptation, revealing that it will be an entirely original story and, despite fan speculation, Leon Kennedy from the games won't be there.</p>



<p><em>It's an entirely original story. When you watch it, you'll be like, 'This is very Zach.' It's just it takes place in the Resident Evil world. I don't think fans of the games are gonna be bummed. I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous. But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna like tell a Resident Evil story in the Resident Evil canon that still leaves everything they love intact from the games, you know what I mean?</em></p>



<p><em>I think that when you see it, you'll understand how I can be obsessed with original ideas and still make a movie that is an IP-based thing. I know that doesn't make a lot of sense now, but I hope that it will later.</em></p>



<p>We only know the very basics of this original story based on the synopsis. Apparently, a 'hapless courier' is sent to deliver a package to a remote hospital and soon finds himself caught in the middle of an outbreak and must battle hordes of mutated creatures to survive. The courier is probably going to be played by Austin Abrams, who was the first actor to be confirmed for the Resident Evil movie. Abrams has been featured in This Is Us, Euphoria, Wolfs, and Weapons.</p>



<p>This will be the third film saga based on CAPCOM's survival horror IP. The first and most famous is the series of six movies directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, starring Milla Jovovich. In 2021, there was an attempted reboot with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city-director-says-the-most-challenging-part-was-living-up-to-zombie-movies-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</a>, which was more faithful than Anderson's movies to the games but still largely failed to captivate critics and fans. The following year, a way less faithful TV series adaptation was released on Netflix; it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-tv-series-canceled-by-netflix-after-one-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> after the first season.</p>



<p>Cregger's new Resident Evil film will debut in theaters on September 18, 2026. Meanwhile, a brand new game installment, Requiem, will be released on February 27, 2026. You can find our Gamescom 2025 hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">confirmed</a> that the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles would be increasing globally, though the steepest increases would be hitting the US. Today, Microsoft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">announced</a> that, for the second time this year, the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles will be increased again, with the new prices going into effect in two weeks time on October 3, 2025.</p>



<p>Microsoft didn't specify exactly why prices are going up, instead citing "<em>changes in the macroeconomic environment</em>." It added that understood "<em>that these changes are challenging,</em>" and reassures that they "<em>were made with careful consideration</em>." The price of accessories like controllers and headsets is staying the same for now, and the price of the console in countries outside of the US will also remain the same for now.</p>



<p>To recap, when the price of the consoles and accessories went up in may, the price of the Xbox Series S console went up $80, for both the 512GB and 1TB variants. The price of the Xbox Series X console went up $100, and the price of the 2TB special edition Xbox Series X went up $130. </p>



<p>Thankfully, today's increases aren't as steep, but it's still baffling to hear they're going up at all. While Microsoft doesn't mention the word 'tariffs,' the fact that the increases are isolated to the US points to the current US administration's tariffs as a likely reason behind the two price hikes within the last five months.</p>



<p>Starting October 3, 2025, these are the prices of the Xbox Series line of consoles: </p>



<ul>
<li>Xbox Series X - $649.99 ($50 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition - $799.99 ($70 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series S 512GB - $399.99 ($20 increase)</li>



<li>Xbox Series S 1TB - $449.99 ($20 increase)</li>
</ul>



<p>To be fair, Microsoft isn't the only hardware maker to raise the prices on its consoles. Sony raised the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price of the PS5 by $50 in the US just last month</a>, and while Nintendo has so far only raised the price of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">Switch 2 accessories</a>, the threat of a console price hike<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/"> still looms</a>.</p>



<p>One thing is for sure, though. These price increases won't help Microsoft move more units than they were before. Even if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">console is reportedly profitable</a>, it's difficult to imagine that the added revenue from these price hikes will have a meaningful impact due to how few units are actually being sold week-to-week.</p>
