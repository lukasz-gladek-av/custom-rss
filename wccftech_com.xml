			<p>Woochi the Wayfarer is a new single-player action-adventure game developed by LoreVault Studio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-the-first-descendant-death-relives/">The First Descendent</a> developer, Nexon Games, signed on as its publisher. Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> leaned on a famous Chinese story, Woochi the Wayfarer leans on a famous Korean story, as a press release reveals the game is a depiction of 'The Tale of Jeon Woochi,' a famous Korean novel.</p>



<p>Nexon Games and LoreVault Studio debuted a nearly two-and-a-half-minute cinematic trailer, which set up the grandeur that the Unreal Engine 5 game is certainly going for, but didn't provide any real insight into the gameplay or what the final product will look like when it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future. A release date, or even a release window, was not provided.</p>

<p>In a press release, Nexon Games chief executive officer, Park Yong-hyun, said "<em>Woochi the Wayfarer will provide a fresh and unique play experience that is based on traditional Korean materials while also having an emotional resonance that anyone around the world can relate to. We plan to present a game that will appeal to gamers of all cultures, telling an amazing story that fully showcases Nexon Games' development capabilities and accumulated experience</em>."</p>



<p>The game's soundtrack is inspired by traditional Korean music and is being composed by Korean composer Jung Jae-il, whose work you might recognize from the film Parasite or the Netflix series, Squid Game.</p>



<p>Between the storytelling, the visuals, and the music, it'll be cool to see Korean culture on display in Woochi the Wayfarer. Hopefully, the game is able to stick the landing with its gameplay on top of what already seems to be a strong setting.</p>
