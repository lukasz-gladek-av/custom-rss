			<p>Focus Entertainment Publishing and Saber Interactive have just <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1900226944853004392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the surprise announcement that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 is already in development.</p>
<p>Now, don't get us wrong—there was never any doubt that a sequel would be made, given the resounding commercial success of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, which, last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold five million units in less than three months on the market</a>. However, the timing is definitely sooner than anticipated, especially as the development team is still updating and expanding Space Marine 2. Indeed, the press release makes it a point to stress that an ambitious content roadmap is still planned for Space Marine 2, including the upcoming release of the Horde mode.</p>
<p>Anyway, Saber is promising even more spectacular and more large scale battles in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3. Here's what John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years. Today, we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with Space Marine 3. Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular.</em></p>
<p>Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive, added:</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber. ​ It is the culmination of everything we have learned about game development in our 25 years in the business. ​ We are now starting to develop Space Marine 3, a game that carries with it tremendous expectations from our rapidly expanding fanbase. ​ While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third installment. We view this as an opportunity to create a true love letter to the Warhammer 40.000 universe</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-update-1-2-adds-steam-workshop-mod-integration-barbers-and-lots-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhorse Studios announced that Kingdom Come Deliverance II has received another major free update, version 1.2. Its highlights are the addition of native mod integration through Steam Workshop support and the new barber feature.</p>
<p>The former will allow players to more easily download and install mods into the game rather than jump through various hoops <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as they had to do until now</a>. The caveat is, of course, that the mod has to be available on Steam Workshop. At the time of writing, there are only four mods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412838982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Saving</a> provides the player with a Saviour Schnapps item every time they use or lose one, effectively providing infinite saving.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442455418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helmet of Henry VIII</a> adds a horned helmet for Henry to wear.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442495480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tourist</a> disables NPC reactions to trespassing, opening up several story places that would normally be inaccessible.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3440052578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pebbles the Zebra</a> visually transforms Henry's horse into a zebra.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the modding section will undoubtedly soon be populated with many more mods. Right now, there are over a thousand Kingdom Come Deliverance II mods available on Nexus. While it is unlikely the Steam Workshop section will ever be just as big, several mods should be on both platforms soon.</p>
<p>Henry can also now go to a barber NPC in Zhelejov and Kuttenberg to get a haircut and optionally also pick a new beard style. Regardless of the actual choice, going to a barber will temporarily buff Henry's Charisma stat.</p>
<p>The 1.2 update is much bigger than just those two features, though, as you can glean from scrolling through the lengthy patch notes article <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the game's website</a>. Warhorse says it introduces more than a thousand between fixes and improvements to nearly every aspect of the game. A lot of that has to do with balancing, but there are also enhancements to various animations and NPC behaviors, such as the crime system, which should now be more accurate. The daily NPCs schedules have been fine-tuned, and there are improvements to horse riding, horse trading, character visuals, and performance, especially in Kuttenberg (the largest city in Kingdom Come Deliverance II) and the biggest battles.</p>
<p>Warhorse plans to discuss all of these tweaks in greater detail during a developer stream next Thursday. The studio won't stop working on the game, either, given that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the 2025 roadmap</a>, three premium DLCs are coming in spring, summer, and winter. The excellent open world roleplaying game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in its first two weeks and the Czech studio certainly wants to ride that success as much as possible.</p>
