			<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Definitive Edition has become more immersive than ever before this week, thanks to a new VR mod that's now available for download.</p>
<p>The new mod, which has been developed by Holydh and is now available for free on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grandtheftautothetrilogy/mods/922">Nexus Mods</a>, includes everything players need to play San Andreas Definitive Edition in first-person VR with 6DOF motion controls. Thanks to the implementation of 6DOF controls in particular, it's possible to play the game from beginning to end in VR, as they allow the aiming of all ranged weapons, even in scripted shooting sequences in vehicles as a passenger. The functional Sniper Scope and Camera Screen with zoom in and out function also allows specific weapons that require using a sniper rifle to be completed in VR.</p>

<p>The release of this VR mod definitely makes the purchase of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Definitive Edition more enticing for those who still prefer the original release, although the game, much like GTA 3 and Vice City Definitive Editions, has seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">considerable improvements</a> since its launch in late 2021. You can learn more about the issues that plagued Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition at launch by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition collects some truly groundbreaking games that still provide their share of nostalgic fun, but little has been done to make them shine here in 2021. Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low.</em></p>

			<p>A new Hogwarts Legacy patch has gone live on PC, introducing ray tracing and stability improvements as well as new features that may bring performance improvements for GPUs that don't support NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The April 17th patch introduces, besides some UI improvements, some ray tracing improvements, such as fixed Hogsmeade watermill shadow not rotating with asset and ray-traced reflections system resolution issues, stability and performance improvements, AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeLL and XeFG support, meaning that users that cannot use NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation now have the option of using either AMD or Intel's tech, depending on their GPU. The patch also introduces support for AMD Anti-Lag 2 and updates Intel XeSS 2.0 to the latest version.</p>
<p>The new Hogwarts Legacy patch also packs improvements to the Creator Kit, with plenty of fixes and enhancements for the game's official modding tools. You can check out every fix and improvement the new patch introduces <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/990080/view/576005583301247566?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The game will also launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the system launches.

			<p>Polaris Quest, a Chinese development studio owned by Tencent, has published a new gameplay trailer for Light of Motiram, the game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks a bit too much like Guerrilla's Horizon franchise</a>. Truth be told, there are some gameplay differences. Whereas the Horizon games are action/adventure titles with some light RPG elements thrown in for good measure, Light of Motiram is mostly a survival game where players must establish a base and defend it. The building system will be based on a realistic physics engine.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be a lot of emphasis on taming the over a hundred types of 'Mechanimals'. Each comes with unique skills and growth potential. Players can assign Mechanimals different combat modes and production traits. Combat itself also seems more centered on melee with dodging, blocking, and counterattacking moves. Moreover, Light of Motiram includes seamless cooperative multiplayer throughout the whole game, something that Horizon games have lacked so far - although Guerrilla Games is <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now working on Horizon Online</a>, a co-op game that is the Dutch studio's next big thing. Sure, it's hard to shake the visual similarities, which are definitely more than just inspirations.</p>

<p>Anyway, it won't be long before Light of Motiram becomes available for everyone to check out. Polaris Quest plans to launch it in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android as a free-to-play game. You can find the system requirements below.</p>

			<p>During the Galaxies Showcase, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms published a new trailer for the Painkiller reboot. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late March at the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2024 for a release scheduled later this year.</p>
<p>In the new Painkiller game, players will use these seven weapons to slay all sorts of demons and foes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrodriver: Barrage enemies with rapid-firing shurikens that bounce off hard surfaces.</li>
<li>Stakegun: Hurls high-damage stakes that can impale foes from long-range.</li>
<li>SMG: Unleashes loads of ammo in short, rapid-fire bursts.</li>
<li>Handcannon: Decimate enemies from long range with deadly precision.</li>
<li>Shotgun: Spits destructive pellets at short range that can damage and stagger multiple foes.</li>
<li>Rocket Launcher: Discharges a rocket projectile with a devastating blast radius that can stagger even heavy enemies.</li>
<li>Painkiller: a versatile weapon with a brutal melee attack that hooks onto enemies, shreds them to pieces, and refills your ammo.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Weapons Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dUKtbucEOk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this reboot, players must choose between four playable characters: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. Each comes with unique perks and boosts to energy, health, power, or damage. Tarot cards can be used to enhance character abilities and even combined with those of other players. Indeed, the addition of cooperative multiplayer is arguably the greatest change compared to the original. We'll have to wait and see if the game can retain its signature gameplay even when playing with others.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-fantasy-action-game-covenant-gets-new-trailer.1167654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-fantasy-action-game-covenant-gets-new-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's Galaxies Showcase, independent developer Legion Studio shared the second official trailer for Covenant, an upcoming first-person dark fantasy action game. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at The Game Awards 2024, Covenant is being developed by a 12-person team with industry credits in big franchises like Call of Duty, DOOM, Apex Legends, Battlefield, Destiny, and Halo.</p>
<p>Players will step into the role of a warrior angel sent from the Heavens into Creation to follow in the steps of the fallen angel Malach. According to Legion, this mythical land is designed to be fully interconnected, just like in a Soulslike game. Because of this, puzzles, riddles, platforming, and exploration are going to be part of the player's journey. Discovering shortcuts and seeking out hidden paths will be the key to uncovering every secret.</p>
<p>Of course, combat is the core of the game. The developers said they have put a lot of emphasis on melee combat, which was inspired by fighting games (Tekken, Smash Bros), immersive sims (Dark Messiah, Dishonored), and action games (Dark Souls). There are even different stances that change the player character's entire fighting style, down to the way they run, jump, kick, and slide. Each of the stances drastically modifies the play style. Magic will also play a key role in complementing the build crafting, strategy, and creativity that players will be able to exhibit.</p>
<p>Covenant will support co-op multiplayer as well as competitive multiplayer in dedicated 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Galaxies Showcase Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpuDEWCyoVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game is said to be still in early development. Legion said they'd like to avoid going into early access, but it may become necessary at some point if the studio needs financial help (they are currently seeking a publisher). They would also wish to port their game to consoles, but for now, they can only promise the PC version, which can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
