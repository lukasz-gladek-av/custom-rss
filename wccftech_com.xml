			<p>Video game designer Michel Ancel is primarily known for his work on Rayman, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, and Rabbids, although he also became infamous for two big failed projects attached to his name: Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 and WiLD.</p>
<p>Ancel <a href="https://wccftech.com/michel-ancel-retires-from-the-industry-wild-and-beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired</a> from the games industry in September 2020, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-disarray-michel-ancel-toxic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allegations of toxic management</a>. Since then, he's been busy with something entirely different: an ecological project for the preservation of nature. However, French website <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superpouvoir</a> (which tipped us about the article) managed to score an interview with him to discuss the aforementioned unsuccessful game projects.</p>
<p>When it comes to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, Michel Ancel cited issues with the other key figures in the studio at Ubisoft Montpellier. Apparently, they couldn't agree on a singular vision for the game.</p>
<p><em>On BGE2, there were too many problems between managers. The artistic director wanted to redo everything constantly, the game director wanted to make a game of generated dungeons and I dreamed of a space adventure. We simply could not agree and the game director took the project in other directions.</em></p>
<p><em>In this type of situation, teams find themselves tossed around and don't even know who's in charge and making decisions. The producer is supposed to sort things out, but that didn't happen. Yves Guillemot even had to go down to Montpellier to get things back on track, but that wasn't enough and the game director continued in his stubbornness. When I read in Libé that I was the one directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was going to choke. BGE2 is the game on which I don't think I've ever questioned a decision. I'd be happy to discuss this topic with any potential detractors.</em></p>
<p><em>In the end, all this is a matter of passionate managers who did not get along. I believe that for some time now, these people have been thanked and the project has found a certain balance with new managers. These management concerns are of course very damaging for the teams. All this shows that indeed, it is not simple: a lot of egos and a lot of issues with clearly improvable human management.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a huge difference between developing a BGE2 that requires new technology and a project with known tech and gameplay. I believe that for a long time, the complexity of such a project was beyond many people at Ubisoft… and also in the press that did not hesitate to take shortcuts to sell paper at the time of the Parisian affairs.</em></p>
<p><em>There was not a single big bad guy but a sum of key concerns, unresolved at the level of the managers, of which I was one. I have my share of responsibility, and I should have defended the project better, been more present and more conciliatory with the collaborators.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michel Ancel had also founded his own studio, Wild Sheep, which was working on the PlayStation exclusive <a href="http://wccftech.com/ancel-working-hard-ps4-exclusive-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WiLD</a>, a survival game set in a procedurally generated Neolithic world. It was announced at Gamescom 2014 and shown once again at Paris Games Week 2015, but then the studio went silent for a long time. The development reportedly continued after Ancel retired, but a few months ago, creative director Steven ter Heide <a href="https://x.com/StevenTerHeide1/status/1818716603942400382?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the project is no longer being actively worked on.</p>
<p>In the interview, Ancel explained why this project also had what he described as a 'very unfortunate fate':</p>
<p><em>In 2018, we had a very nice playable version, but we took time to upgrade the game on PS5, which slowed down production. On the Sony side, there were big management changes and the game was stopped. Ubisoft offered to take it back, and shortly after, Sony decided to take it back by even offering to double the budgets! Unfortunately, the contracts with Ubisoft were well advanced and we refused Sony's proposal. What a shame!</em></p>
<p><em>It was during this period that I had my burnout and, unfortunately, the game fell into the hands of the Ubisoft editorial department in Paris, itself in full chaos. I was no longer there to defend the game, which was literally crushed by people from this department who asked for all sorts of changes without really playing the game. A real scandal. After two years of wandering, the game was abandoned on the pretext that it no longer corresponded to the initial game... You have to understand that at this time, the editorial department was in full explosion following the internal affairs surrounding Tommy François, who was also in charge of WiLD.</em></p>
<p>Michel Ancel also revealed that he doesn't really have much time to play anymore. He did not completely shut down the door to a return to the industry, although he clarified the context would have to be 'optimal'.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MachineGames has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/509566179781640981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which technically launches today even though early access actually started last Friday for pre-order customers who purchased the Premium Edition.</p>
<p>This patch's highlight is undoubtedly the addition of full-blown path tracing, which was missing from the review build, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I noted in my article</a>. Now, owners of NVIDIA RTX graphics cards can activate the computationally expensive (the developers recommend at least 12GB of VRAM) yet visually impressive mode.</p>
<p>YouTuber Tyrian has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmeGdJD4_w4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the first video comparison to demonstrate the graphics improvements enabled by path tracing in the game. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle supports ray traced sun shadows, ray traced reflections, and ray traced indirect illumination, all of which can now be toggled in the graphics settings. After turning everything on, the improvement is easily noticeable. However, the performance hit is just as stark, with Tyrian's RTX 4080 graphics card having its frame rate cut in half (or even lower) when path tracing is enabled.</p>
<p>Still, it should be manageable for the RTX 4080 by setting DLSS Super Resolution to Performance and activating the obligatory DLSS Frame Generation. Of course, the top-class RTX 4090 remains the best choice for anyone who wants to go all-in with path tracing - at least until its successor, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-blackwell-gb202-gpu-flagship-geforce-rtx-5090-to-measure-around-744mm2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5090</a>, launches next month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Path Tracing ON vs OFF! RTX 4080 4K DLSS" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmeGdJD4_w4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Indiana Jones and the Great Circle update also fixes a number of bugs, as you'd expect for any first post-launch patch nowadays, including a bug I had reported to the developers during the review process (HDR and DLSS sometimes produced a moiré effect when enabled together). Moreover, MachineGames is also thinking about AMD users. They promised that FidelityFX Super Resolution would be integrated into the game in a future update. There is still a known issue that the developers pointed out to the community. Sometimes, when starting the game with DLSS enabled, the game will run slower than intended. When this happens, until a final fix is released, you should switch from DLSS to TAA and then back to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is available now on PC and Xbox Series S|X, and Game Pass subscribers can access it without any additional cost. The game will&nbsp;<span>also be&nbsp;released next Spring for PlayStation 5</span>. It's certainly worth keeping an eye out for PS5 users, as I mentioned in my review:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>

			<p>Sony's move to make a series of "Grand Theft Auto" entries as exclusive PlayStation titles was apparently influenced by the release of Microsoft's Xbox, reveals former PlayStation EU President.</p>
<p>Well, Rockstar's GTA series being exclusive to PlayStation wasn't just an unplanned move. According to an interview with Chris Deering (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>), a former PlayStation official, it is revealed that the franchise was purposefully limited to Sony's game consoles in an attempt to steer off interest in the upcoming "Xbox" release at that time. Deering says that folks at PlayStation were apparently "worried" about Microsoft's console, and the idea of making the Grand Theft Auto franchise exclusive popped up "randomly".</p>
<p><em>We were worried when we saw Xbox coming. We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, 'How would you like a special deal if you keep your next generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?'</em></p>
<p><em>And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game. It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media</em></p>
<p>So, the Sony x Take-Two partnership was driven by Microsoft's Xbox release, and it won't be wrong to say that this decision has been pivotal for the success of Sony's past consoles and the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Ultimately, the collaboration was a win-win for both parties, and whether this move managed to overshadow the Xbox release is now a thing of the past.</p>
<p>For Grand Theft Auto 6, exclusivity for PlayStation is certainly out of the equation for now since the franchise is expected to follow a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-version-release-not-mentioned-by-rockstar-consoles-2025/">similar release strategy</a> to what they did with GTA 5. That means consoles first, then other platforms such as PC.</p>
