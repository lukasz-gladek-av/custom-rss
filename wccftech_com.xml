			<p>If you're looking for a way to celebrate the festive season in Mortal Kombat 1, then look no longer. It's been announced today by Warner Bros. Games that new holiday-themed in-game events will be arriving at the game from December 19 through to December 30. These events will be staggered across the days, with each event providing different rewards upon completion. The rewards come in the form of new character palettes, of which the details will be provided below. The events comprise five new Towers of Time events, which are free events available to all owners of Mortal Kombat 1. Below are all of the details you need about these events so you can pick and choose which ones you want to participate in based on the character palettes that you can unlock.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bloody Snow&nbsp;</strong>Tower (December 19-25) - Yuletide Necromancer &amp; Christmas Evil character palettes for Quan Chi</li>
<li><strong>Naughty List</strong> Tower (December 21-26) - Souls of Winter &amp; Holiday Collection palettes for Ermac</li>
<li><strong>A Christmas Krampus</strong> Tower (December 23-30) Holiday Hero &amp; Winter Wonderman palettes for Takeda</li>
<li><strong>'Twas the Night</strong> Tower (December 25-30) - Angel on High &amp; Holidazzle palettes for Cyrax</li>
<li><strong>Final Present</strong> Tower (December 26-30) - Eat, Drink, and Be Lethal &amp; Bah, Humbug palettes for Sektor</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these character palettes, players will be given the option to purchase new holiday skins for Kameo Fighters Frost and Sareena, as well as the previously released festive skins Santa's Helper Reptile, Krampus General Shao and Mrs. Klause Kitana.</p>
<p>For those who aren't owners of Mortal Kombat 1 yet, there is now the option to purchase the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Kollection, which is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store. This collection includes the main Mortal Kombat 1 game, as well as the Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion, the previous Kombat Pack, and 1,250 Dragon Krystals.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you already own the game but you don't have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-trailer-showcases-noob-saibot/">Khaos Reigns content</a>, you can upgrade your version of the game with Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns, which will provide you with a new story expansion, as well as Konbat Pack 2, which adds Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot to the game. There are also some new guest fighters on the way that will be added to the game via Kombat Pack 2. This includes Ghostface, who is already in the game, as well as one-week early access to guest fighter Conan the Barbarian, who is set to be released on January 21. T-1000 Terminator is also set to join Mortal Kombat 1 but doesn't yet have an official release date.</p>
<p>What character palettes will you be aiming for this year?</p>

			<p>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition has officially launched for free on<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ark-ultimate-mobile-edition/id6639622324" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studiowildcard.arkuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a> today, with the game being completely free to play for those who want to get stuck into the Dino adventure. This announcement came from Grove Street Games and publisher Snail Games in partnership with Studio Wildcard. This is a brand-new free <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">adaptation of ARK</a>, serving as a massive mobile dino-adventure that will include the full-scale experience of ARK: Survival Evolved, as well as the ARK Expansion Packs. This consists of Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, Genesis Parts 1 &amp; 2, and the fan-favorite Ragnarok map that was created by the community. This is just the tip of the dino-shaped iceberg, as there is plenty more that will be available in this mobile adventure, with a promise of thousands of gameplay hours.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to get their games through the Epic Games Store mobile marketplace, it will soon be available there. If you're not sure how ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition is panning out, you can check out the gameplay launch trailer below, which gives you a glimpse into what you can expect. The trailer is just over a minute long, and showcases some of the key features of the game, the same features that are in the PC and console versions of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U014C9C2X60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition comes with massive worlds for you to explore, with over 150 dinosaurs and creatures to tame and train as your own, as well as multiplayer tribe dynamics so that you can partner up with friends. Of course, it wouldn't be ARK without the crafting and building experience, which you will be able to dive into from the outset. The app launches today with the original ARK Island Map, Scorched Earth, and Aberration expansions. The rest of the expansions will be available for players by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>For those interested, there is also the option to opt-in to a subscription service called the ARK Pass. If you want to subscribe to the ARK Pass, it's available at a $4.99 monthly cost or a $49.99 annual subscription price, whichever is preferable for you. By having access to the ARK Pass, you will get access to every current and future Expansion Pack, as well as monthly bonuses. These bonuses include God Console, giving you access to console commands if you're playing in a single-player, bonus XP in all game modes, monthly drops of free 'Keys,' and exclusive access to servers.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Expansion Packs and features for ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition can also be purchased separately, depending on what you prefer.</p>
