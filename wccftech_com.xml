			<p>It's been announced today by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/04/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond-launches-february-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Baskin</a>, Social Media and Community Manager of Arrowhead Game Studios, that the next Warbond to be added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-wins-goty-at-tiga-awards-2024/">award-winning</a> Helldivers 2 will be released on February 6. Its full title is Warbond: Servants of Freedom. Helldivers 2 is already an incredibly chaotic game, but now even more chaos will be unleashed with the addition of Portable Hellbombs, which you can carry around as a backpack before dropping it off and setting it to blow. You only have ten seconds to clear out, so make it quick.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from this update, make sure to check out the trailer below, which is just under a minute long.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Servants of Freedom Warbond | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7s2Es5g7fwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Sickle can now do even more, as the LAS-17 Double-Edge Sickle burns both the wielder and the ones on the receiving end of the weapon. It's a bit of a niche choice when it comes to weaponry, but it may just be something that you find plenty of enjoyment in. Alongside the Portable Hellbombs and the Sickle, you can now equip a grenade pistol. Known simply as the Ultimatum, you can launch grenades like never before. Instead of shooting them further away, the Ultimatum is designed for close-range use. However, it still packs an almighty punch, so be careful where you aim it.</p>
<p>A new throwable has been added in this Helldivers 2 Warbond. Named the G-50 Seeker, it's a small drone that follows after you and then explodes near enemies when detected. It can also be used to target pinged enemies and hunt them down to then detonate when found.</p>
<p>Weapons aren't the only thing being added in the Helldivers 2: Servants of Freedom Warbond, as there is new armor for you to try out. The IE-3 Martyr and the IE-12 Righteous medium armors come equipped with the Integrated Explosives passive.</p>
<p>To be able to access this Servants of Freedom Warbond when it releases, you will, of course, need to own Helldivers 2. It also requires a paid purchase of Super Credits and game progression to unlock.</p>
<p>Will you be purchasing this Warbond when it releases on February 6? Let us know in the comments what you're excited for with this new update.</p>

			<p>Following the launch of NVIDIA DLSS 4, NVIDIA confirmed today that PC gamers can use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA app DLSS Override functionality</a> to enable the new transformer AI model and even Multi Frame Generation in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-demo-out-now-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo of The First Berserker: Khazan</a>. Of course, Multi Frame Generation is only available to owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5090</a> or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-suprim-soc-16-gb-gpu-review-superior-cooling-stunning-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 5080</a> (the RTX 5070 and 5070Ti are slated to launch later this month). The First Berserker: Khazan is scheduled to be released on March 27; you can read our take on the action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As part of an NVIDIA DLSS news round-up, NVIDIA said that the Unreal Engine 5 powered <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> remaster supports DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, though the DLSS Override functionality isn't enabled for either the new transformer AI model or Multi Frame Generation. The same goes for Level Zero: Extraction, the multiplayer extraction horror shooter developed by Doghowl Games and published by tinyBuild, which has recently launched out of early access with standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation integration.&nbsp;In two days, developer Aesir Interactive and publisher NACON will release Ambulance Life: A Paramedic Simulator, which is described as the first paramedic simulation game. This title also supports standard DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth supports standard DLSS Super Resolution (you can turn it into DLAA by simply setting both maximum and minimum Dynamic Resolution Scaling values to 100%). For some graphics enhancement mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our previous coverage</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Warhorse's excellent (as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our perfect score review</a>) Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launches today with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA. Through the NVIDIA app, users can activate the DLSS Override to force the transformer AI model to take over for improved image quality.</p>
