			<p>Since Fortnite launched in 2017, it has had some downright insane collaborations. The latest one is due to arrive this coming Sunday, November 30, 2025, with the previously unreleased Kill Bill chapter, Yuki's Revenge, coming to Fortnite as part of the Quentin Tarantino collaboration.</p>



<p>Epic Games put out a new teaser trailer for the collaboration today, giving us our first look at the chapter that never made it to the silver screen, but will now see the light of day more than 20 years after the release of Kill Bill Vol. 2.</p>



<p>Fortnite has been a part of several 'firsts' for video games, and this has to be a new one, as it's currently difficult to recall another time when a previously unreleased chapter of a popular film was showcased for the first time as part of a popular video game, instead of, say, a movie theatre.</p>

<p>That said, the short will be shown in theatres, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/yukis-revenge-premieres-in-fortnite-on-november-30?lang=en-US">according to a blog post on the Fortnite website</a>. "<em>Starting December 5, participating theaters in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom will show Yuki’s Revenge as part of an exclusive limited theatrical run of </em><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em>," the blog post reads.</p>



<p>US players who purchase a ticket to go see the short in theatres between November 20 and November 29 will also receive a code for the in-game Gogo Yubari outfit at participating theatres. </p>



<p>This weekend in Fortnite also marks the end of Chapter Six and the beginning of Chapter Seven, with Zero Hour kicking off this coming Saturday, November 29, 2025.</p>

			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has just confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>, the eleventh expansion pack for the most popular subscription-based MMORPG, will be released on Monday, March 2, 2026 at 3:00 PM Pacific Time.</p>



<p>An earlier rumor from leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> a February 26, 2026 date. It appears that Blizzard has finally settled on taking a few more days, though it really is a nearly insignificant delay compared to the date listed in that report.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight is the middle chapter of the trilogy known as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>. This narrative was conceived by returning writer Chris Metzen, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-metzen-blizzard-retires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Blizzard in 2016</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-christ-metzen-returning-lead-franchise-wow-next-generation-of-adventures/">returned in 2023</a>. Following the events of the previous expansion, The War Within, Xal’atath, the so-called Harbinger of the Void, returns to Azeroth and unleashes utter chaos in her wake. The ensuing invasion strikes at the heart of the Blood Elf homelands in Eversong Woods. Meanwhile, the looming Voidstorm threatens to extinguish all light and cover the world in darkness as it arrives over the ancient elven kingdom of Quel'thalas.</p>



<p>As mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my previous Deep Dive article</a>, the expansion introduces player housing through the so-called Neighborhoods, the new opt-in Prey bounty hunting system, the new Haranir Allied Race, the new Devourer specialization for the Demon Hunter class, four explorable zones (the Eversong Woods, which have been merged with the Ghostlands; Zul'Aman; Harandar; and the Voidstorm), eleven Delves, eight Dungeons, three Raids, new PvP content (a new Battleground and the Training Grounds as a permanent mode), a reimagined Silvermoon City that now hosts the Horde and Alliance both, and other improvements to User Interface and transmogrification. In the campaign storyline, players will have the option to choose which of multiple paths to complete first.</p>

<p>While you'll have to wait for early March to play most of the content in World of Warcraft: Midnight, player housing is actually being made available in early access starting next Tuesday, on December 2, for those players who pre-purchased the expansion. To celebrate the arrival of this long-requested feature, Blizzard crafted a range of special rewards across all its games for players who move into their first home and earn the new 'Welcome Home' achievement in World of Warcraft.</p>



<p>Overwatch 2 players can look forward to the following in-game unlocks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Xal’atath Symmetra Legendary Skin</li>



<li>Xal’atath Symmetra Spray</li>



<li>Xal'atath Symmetra Name Card</li>



<li>Dark Heart Player Icon</li>
</ul>



<p>Hearthstone players will unlock the Hearth &amp; Home Card Back. Furthermore, separate from the WoW achievement, the collectible card game now hosts a new, limited-time in-game event, 'Welcome to the Neighborhood!', featuring an earnable Epic event card.</p>



<p>Lastly, in StarCraft II, players will be able to show their allegiance in every match with the new Horde and Alliance StarCraft II skins. Weirdly, there won't be any Diablo IV tie-in unlocks.</p>
