			<p>Announced during QuakeCon 2025, id Software and Nightdive Studios have shadow dropped Heretic+Hexen, a remaster collection of the two magic-based FPS games built off the back of id Software's DOOM Engine originally developed by Raven Software in 1994 (Heretic) and 1995 (Hexen).</p>



<p>The collection is available right now on PC and all major console platforms, meaning you can grab it on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, though there's no specific Nintendo Switch 2 version. For Xbox players, it's also available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles, so Game Pass subscribers can download it to their preferred device and begin reliving the mid-90's shooters.</p>



<p>It'll also soon be playable through <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-mafia-the-old-country-titan-quest-ii-stormgate/">GeForce Now</a>, though a specific date for its inclusion in the GeForce Now roster has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>A nice boon for fans of the games who might've already purchased the digital versions of Heretic and Hexen available on the Xbox Store or Steam is that <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes">a free upgrade is available</a> for owners of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and/or Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel.</p>



<p>And if you're new to both shooters and are picking up the collection to play them for the first time, you'll be able to play through the three titles mentioned above, along with two brand new episodes made by Nightdive and id Software, titled: Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur.</p>



<p>The remasters feature improved performance on the classic titles with both games playable at a 4K resolution and at 120FPS, a wide range of accessibility options and game balancing options, widescreen support, mod support, and a new Vault section that includes early concept art for the development of both games and some unused sprites for fans of the originals to sink their teeth into.</p>
