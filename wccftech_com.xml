			<p>The development team behind Skyblivion, the total conversion mod that seeks to recreate The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in Skyrim, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwUibq6wBn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a new progress update to celebrate the advent of the new year. As you probably remember, 2025 is the year they had <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designated</a> for the long-awaited release, and this was confirmed in the new video.&nbsp;Then, the team focused on the progress of specific areas:</p>
<p><em>We're finalizing the world map with only the Nibenay region on Cyrodiil's eastern border left to complete. Massive swathes of the map are ready for the hero of Kvatch to explore.</em></p>
<p>Most of the landscapes have been completed (though they still need to be fully navmeshed to allow NPCs to properly navigate the areas). The only exceptions are the Nibenay Valley (268 out of 300 cells completed), the Nibenay Basin (289 out of 674 cells done). As such, 93% of the cells in Skyblivion are ready, though only 44% are navmeshed. The team is still looking for new volunteer recruits to speed up the navmeshing process. Likewise, they put out a shout for 3D artists with a specialty in plants, as only 74 of the 118 3D plant objects have been remade so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Path To Release (Skyblivion Roadmap 2024)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LwUibq6wBn4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many quests were implemented in 2024. In last year's update, the team still needed to add over a hundred quests; now, only six haven't had work on them started yet. As for music, the team has not only ported all the music from Oblivion, but they also added 24 new tracks: one for each region of Cyrodiil, three new dungeon exploration tracks, three new night exploration tracks, two new boss fight themes, and three new atmospheric tracks that will play when roaming through Oblivion realms.</p>
<p>Lastly, Skyblivion was always meant to include the DLCs, such as the large expansion Shivering Isles. However, they likely won't be available when the mod launches:</p>
<p><em>A note on Shivering Isles and the other big DLC. We are currently focused on the main game experience to ensure it is released on time. Once the main game of Skyblivion is released, we will look into how we can tackle DLCs.</em></p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> of an official The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster from Bethesda. That would be a bit of a wrench in the team's plans, though there's no official confirmation for the time being.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-is-free-to-add-to-your-epic-games-store-library/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Store's New Year's Gift is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> from Warhorse Studios. You've got until 5 PM today to permanently add it to your library. Like Christmas's gift, <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy's Control</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance was also previously featured as a freebie <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-free-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early 2020</a>. Likewise, just as Control, in case you didn't grab it at the time, you absolutely should do it now.</p>
<p>For one thing, it'll get you prepared for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>, which is scheduled to launch in just a month. That's around the right amount of time you'll need to complete, as just the main story requires over 40 hours of gameplay on average. If you add side content, it's easily going to double that figure. This is just the base game, mind you - there are also a few DLCs, which you can <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance--royal-dlc-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grab for $3.99</a> (with an 80% discount) with the ongoing Holiday sale.</p>
<p>Originally funded via Kickstarter, Kingdom Come Deliverance has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over eight million units to date. It is a first-person roleplaying game set in a fully historical setting, 1403 Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic), at the time of King Wenceslaus IV. This would already be enough to make the game stand out from most RPGs. Adding to that, the main character, Henry of Skalitz, is the mere son of a blacksmith. And no, he never gets magic powers or anything like that.</p>
<p>It's all quite realistic, and so are the missions, which sometimes ask the player to perform regular chores as would be required for a relatively lowly person in the medieval ages. Even so, Warhorse managed to make it feel fun on most occasions, although you'll definitely need a greater deal of patience than in most RPGs, especially as you learn the unique direction-based combat system. The characters are very well-written, and some scenes are absolutely memorable.</p>
