			<p>Today, NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation support is being integrated into Indiana Jones and the Great Circle with a new game update. As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, players can take advantage of the new transformer-based DLSS AI model, which improves image quality compared to the previous CNN-based model. Users with the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can also enable Multi Frame Generation, reaching much higher frame rates on their configurations. And even GeForce RTX 40 GPU owners can take advantage of the updated Frame Generation model, which delivers higher frame rates and consumes less video RAM.</p>
<p>Moreover, MachineGames improved the game's visuals by adding fully ray traced shadows to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you own an RTX GPU and use ray tracing, the update also adds DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which replaces multiple denoisers with NVIDIA's unified AI model, improving surface detail, drawing more precise shadows are more precise, enhancing lighting and delivering more accurate reflections. Lastly, the game also includes native DLAA support for those with spare headroom (GeForce RTX 5090 owners, in all likelihood). However, it seems like the new RTX Hair feature didn't make it into this update as previously planned.</p>

<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will also be available tomorrow in Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, the campaign mode of the shooter game developed by Team Jade. According to NVIDIA, a GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card can get up to 265.9 average frame rate per second in the game with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (CNN model). For more about Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, check out Kai's hands-on preview of this mode.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in an earlier article today, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will also be available starting tomorrow in NetEase's Marvel Rivals with the new patch.</p>

			<p>Today, Funcom has announced the release date of its upcoming game, Dune: Awakening. Previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled for Q1 2025</a> on PC, the survival MMO will now debut on May 20, priced at $49.99. Pre-orders will begin soon, said Funcom, promising the in-game bonus Terrarium of Muad’Dib, a beautiful in-base decoration that houses the iconic desert mouse.</p>
<p>Even more interestingly, the Norwegian developer has released both benchmark and character creator. Players can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> the former to check how well their PC will run the Unreal Engine 5-powered Dune: Awakening while the benchmark goes through an ornithopter flight and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm. With the latter, players will be able to create their characters starting today, which will then be importable into the full game on May 20.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DA_MuadibCage_2K_02-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>They must undergo the Gom Jabbar test and fine-tune every aspect of their appearance, as well as pick their home planet, their caste, and their mentor, which is tied to different combat schools: Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper. This choice also determines the player character's starting abilities, though the game later opens up access to all schools, letting players mix and match abilities from any of them to create their own play styles. Those who play both benchmark and character creator will get a complimentary Frameblade knife skin at launch.</p>
<p>Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-develop-games-dune-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secured the license</a> to develop Dune games in early 2019, before any of the movies were released. Shortly afterward, they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-offers-to-fully-acquire-funcom-scope-of-dune-survival-game-to-be-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Tencent, which allowed them to increase the scope of this project. Now, the studio is calling this 'the most ambitious survival game ever made', and it might just be correct based on what we've seen.</p>

<p>You can find our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer Q&amp;A</a> at the respective hyperlinks. On PC, the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjnEiP9a9kQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> for owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards. A console version of Dune: Awakening is highly likely, but will come at a later date.</p>
