			<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>, former BioWare veteran Mark Darrah revealed that Electronic Arts refused several pitches from the studio to remake or remaster Dragon Age: Origins and, potentially, the second and third game, too. </p>



<p><em>I'm not pitching a Dragon Age to EA right now. I don't know what I'd want to do, to be honest, to go forward with it. I mean, I honestly think they should do - I don't think they will, but I think they should do a remaster of the first three. One of the things that we pitched at one point, pretty softly so pitch is a massive overstatement, was to kind of retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy. We'd call it the Champions trilogy, so you have these big, larger-than-life heroes. You've got the Hero of Ferelden, you've got the Champion of Kirkwall, and then you've got the Inquisitor. I think as a first step, you take those three games, and maybe Veilguard, you shine them up, re-release them, and see what happens and go from there.</em></p>



<p>Darrah, an Executive Producer on the first three Dragon Age games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a consultant on the fourth</a>, said that the publisher has been historically reluctant to do remasters. While they did the successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-highest-concurrent-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a> a while ago, that was made easier by the fact that all those games were powered by Unreal Engine technology, whereas Dragon Age: Origins was powered by the proprietary Eclipse Engine, DAII by the Lycium Engine (an upgraded version of the Eclipse), and Inquisition by Frostbite.</p>



<p><em>EA has historically been, and I don't really know why but they've even said this publicly, they're kind of against remasters. I don't really know why. It's strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. That's part of it. The other problem is that Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do; to some degree, unknowably harder. Maybe only a little bit harder, maybe a lot harder.</em></p>



<p><em>One of the very earliest things for Joplin was, let's do Frostbite tools, and then let's find a mod house that seems talented and just uplift them and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age: Origins. There were lots of pitches around, 'Is there a way we can bring Dragon: Age Origins forward?'</em></p>

			<p>The Battlefield 6 beta is now open to everyone, and the concurrent users peak on Steam (the only platform where we can reliably check it, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to SteamDB</a>) has already surpassed 470K. It's entirely likely that it will break through 500K concurrent users before this beta weekend is over. As a reminder, playing this weekend will guarantee the unlock of two skins (Seeker Soldier and All-Terrain Soldier), the Dominion weapon package, two weapon stickers, and the Lights Out player card background. Playing during the next weekend (from Thursday, August 14 to Sunday, August 17) will provide access to the War Machine vehicle skin, the Striking Distance weapon package, and the Bat Company dog tag.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 introduced a kernel-level anticheat that requires the SecureBoot feature to be enabled on PC.  Even so, there were plenty of cheat attempts, as relayed by the SPEAR Anti-Cheat Team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3081410/discussions/0/600786083350058140/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a post on the Steam forum</a>:</p>



<p><em>Since the launch of Open Beta Early Access:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.</em></li>



<li><em>You’ve reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today.</em></li>



<li><em>We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The team also explained that the requirement of the SecureBoot was never going to be a 'silver bullet' to end all cheats:</p>



<p><em>Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do. There are certain signals that we can only trust when Secure Boot is enabled.</em></p>



<p>The fight against cheaters in Battlefield 6 will continue unabated, and the team vowed to give no quarter to hacks and the like, especially when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 10</a>.</p>
