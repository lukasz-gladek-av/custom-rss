			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is continuing to make amazing progress and is now capable of booting and running multiple console exclusives.</p>
<p>The latest version of the only PlayStation 4 emulator that can run <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-4k-100-fps-rtx-4070/">Bloodborne</a> fairly well is now capable of booting another PlayStation 4 exclusive that is likely to stay so in the foreseeable future, The Last Guardian. The game is not in a playable state whatsoever, as seen in the video below provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, but the fact that the emulator can now boot the game is still impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Guardian New Gameplay on ShadPS4 Emulator" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4K5HWrnFevI?start=9&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it will be a while until The Last Guardian will be playable on PC, the ShadPS4 emulator is more than capable of running other console exclusives like the aforementioned Bloodborne, which obviously was a priority for the developers due to its popularity, Vanillaware's Dragon's Crown Pro and Odin Sphere Leifhrasir, <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/">Gravity Rush Remastered</a> and others. You can check out how these games, as well as over 50 other ones, currently run on the emulator in the video below put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GAMERNO1INTERNATIONAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GAMER NO 1.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/avowed-30-fps-xbox-series-x/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-will-run-%E2%80%9Cat-least%E2%80%9D-at-30-fps-on-xbox-series-x-obsidian-wants-to-fully-deliver-a-beautiful-world-at-the-best-framerate-possible.1041900/</guid>

			<p>Avowed developer Obsidian Entertainment will make sure the game will run at the very least at 30 frames per second on Xbox Series X, but this framerate is not its target, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@marcello696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parris</a>, Game Director Carrie Patel commented on the performance level that should be expected on Xbox Series X, saying that the game will run at the very least at 30 FPS, but this level of performance is not the team's target. As of now, the developer is fully into performance optimization and is committed to delivering a beautiful world at the best framerate they possibly can.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Preview With Game Director Carrie Patel" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzJTfeOjzkg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Judging from this statement, it is definitely a good thing Avowed was delayed to February 2025, as the extra time could allow developer Obsidian to spend more time on optimization and deliver framerates higher than 30 FPS at launch. Phil Spencer himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/">commented</a> on the game's delay, saying that the game's quality didn't cause it and that the developer would make use of the extra time it did not need to release the game.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on February 18th. You can learn more about what makes the game feel fun and engaging in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/">preview.</a></p>

			<p>The latest Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws is <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-biggest-update-to-come-21-november/">the biggest one yet</a>, and the team has been working towards making some huge changes both in graphics and in gameplay. For the most part, this Title Update has had a significant focus on combat and stealth to allow the player to have more control of their decisions, as well as allowing players to keep hold of pick-up weapons for longer. For those who may be getting stuck into Star Wars Outlaws, this is how big the update is on each platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 7.44 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 10.18 GB</li>
<li>PC: 8.83 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>A few notable changes have been made with the latest Title Update in Star Wars Outlaws. Especially when it comes to the stealth and combat options in the game, by updating stealth and combat, players now have more choices to make and can adapt their playstyle accordingly. This includes using stealth or reaching for your blaster, even in syndicate territories in cities.</p>
<p>In conjunction with stealth and combat, enemy AI and detection have been improved. Players are now notified when they're being detected, giving them a choice between breaking stealth and engaging in combat or finding a way to change tactics to remain in stealth. Another layer has been added to the combat system, which involves enemy weak points being added to Star Wars Outlaws. This is so that players who engage in strategic gameplay are rewarded for their efforts, leading to the enemies to die in comedic new ways.</p>
<p>Continuing on with the efforts to fix combat, Kay's blaster and pickup weapons have been re-tuned so that the combat experience is smoother and more enjoyable. This includes the option to carry two-handed weapons more frequently throughout the game.</p>
<p>For many people, the animations and character design is what threw them off, as the characters do have a touch of uncanny valley. The developers for Star Wars Outlaws continue to work on this, with facial expressions and animations now being improved in dialogue scenes. This also comes with a new option to toggle the cinematic lens during gameplay, as well as distant lights being more visible when traversing through the game.</p>
<p>These are only the highlights of what was added in this Title Update for Star Wars Outlaws, and the patch notes carry on for quite a while. You can read them in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2842040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded blog post</a>, which goes into detail about everything that has been changed in the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Shenmue III Publishing Rights Transferred to ININ Games]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games.1041762/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Previously, Shenmue III's publishing rights were Deep Silver's, a company that has previously published titles such as Dead Island: Riptide, Metro Redux, and most recently, Metro Awakening.&nbsp; Shenmue III was first released for PlayStation 4 and PC via Epic Games Store in 2019, with a Steam and GOG release following a year later. Now, the publishing rights have transferred from Deep Silver over to <a href="https://www.iningames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ININ Games</a>, a publisher known for bridging the gap between Japanese media and the West. They have published titles such as Air Twister, Parasol Stars, and Rainbow Cotton.</p>
<p>"Following the previous collaboration on Air Twister, this will deepen the relationship with the legendary creator Yu Suzuki and his team. Known for our commitment to celebrating beloved titles and bringing them to new platforms, ININ Games is excited to shepherd Shenmue III into its next phase," says the announcement from ININ Games. The transfer of publishing rights coincides with two milestones within the Shenmue franchise. The transfer took place during the 25th anniversary of the Shenmue franchise and the fifth anniversary of Shenmue III.</p>
<p>"We at ININ Games are honored to carry the Shenmue torch forward during such a significant moment in the series' history. As we reflect on two decades of innovation and passion, we remain dedicated to preserving and sharing the journey of Ryo Hazuki with both long-time fans and newcomers."</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven't been any announcements as to what the plans are with Shenmue III or the overall franchise as a whole, but the transfer is still relatively fresh, meaning they need time to plan out their announcements and plans for the game going forward. However, they have promised that there will be upcoming announcements, as they signed off on their announcement.</p>
<p>"With this transfer, the story of Shenmue is far from over. We have exciting plans to celebrate these anniversaries, ensuring that this beloved series continues to thrive and inspire. Keep an eye out for upcoming announcements as we unveil our vision for the next phase of Shenmue's legacy."</p>
<p>Currently, the title is only available on PC and PlayStation 4. However, with the transfer of the rights, it's possible that this game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iv-still-in-planning-phase-needs-a-partner-to-be-made-ue5-remakes-of-first-two-games-might-be-fun/">any future titles</a> within the franchise will be seen on other platforms, such as Xbox Series X|S and maybe the Nintendo Switch.</p>
