			<p>In September 2023, the existence of a new Xbox controller was <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-controller-to-feature-haptics-and-speakers-like-ps5s-dualsense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> due to the inadvertent sharing of an internal Microsoft document as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft legal fight. The controller, codenamed Sebile, would feature improved wireless, direct-to-cloud connection, Bluetooth 5.2, new modular thumbsticks, replaceable and rechargeable batteries, and other minor improvements. The big addition, though, was the DualSense-like haptics feature.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer did not hide <a href="https://wccftech.com/dualsense-controller-praised-by-microsofts-head-of-gaming-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his appreciation</a> for the PlayStation 5 controller when it launched alongside Sony's console in late 2020. A few months later, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dualsense-controller-praised-phil-spencer-xbox-controller-updates-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> the concept while also teasing that Xbox would have to catch up in this area. The document leak proved he was very serious about that. However, since there haven't been any official updates on the topic, there was no way to know whether the project bore fruit. After all, it could have easily been canceled.</p>
<p>Fans needn't worry too much about that. Tech4Gamers <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> a newly published <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US444401677&amp;_cid=P22-M4Z00G-73974-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patent</a> clearly linked to the Sebile Xbox controller. The patent was originally filed in late August 2023, just before the aforementioned FTC leak. Here's the patent's abstract:</p>
<p><em>A device configured to generate haptic feedback is disclosed. The device includes a housing, a connector, and a haptic motor. The connector includes a mount end coupled to the housing and a distal end spaced away from the mount end. The haptic motor is coupled to the distal end of the connector. Activation of the haptic motor causes the haptic motor to move relative to the housing to generate the haptic feedback.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-sebile-controller-breaks-cover-in-this-new-patent-and-we-now-know-what-that-the-weird-grippy-trousers-are-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed up</a> by adding that the new Xbox controller is definitely still on the way. However, it is now planned to launch alongside the next Xbox console. Microsoft chose not to invest in a mid-generation refresh like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro</a>; they are instead all-in on the forthcoming generation, which Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> would bring the biggest technical leap ever seen in a console.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are some <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wild rumors</a> that Microsoft could launch the new hardware earlier than Sony, perhaps as soon as 2026, to get an advantage over its competitor (the PlayStation 6 is currently believed to be targeting a 2028 debut). If that's the case, then the Sebile Xbox controller might not be that far off, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/squid-game-event-rumored-to-have-additional-premium-pass-in-cod-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's rumored that Call of Duty will be receiving an additional premium pass for the Squid Game event that is coming soon to <a href="https://wccftech.com/eight-of-octobers-best-selling-games-were-new-releases-black-ops-6-on-top/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Call of Duty: Warzone. The event was officially teased yesterday, where it's said that those who participate in the event will be able to get skins of operatives themed around the hit TV show, as well as blueprints of weapons and other content that fits the Squid Game theme. The crossover event is set to begin on January 3, but more details haven't been released.</p>
<p>This is already causing quite a stir from both Squid Game fans and Call of Duty fans, with some saying that they're completely missing the point of the TV show. The TV show is all about living in a dystopian, capitalist world where people are willing to fight to the death for money. The show just recently got a second season, which was released yesterday on Netflix.</p>

<p>The rumor of the premium pass comes from a user called <a href="https://x.com/xFleXy_/status/1872710285649428579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xFleXy_ on X</a>, where they posted a screenshot of a message that pops up when you load the game. The message reads as the following:</p>
<p><em>Squid Game arrives in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone. Explore an exhilarating Event Pass, where the Premium Track route allows for more incredible rewards, including the Front Man Operator. Plus, a myriad of LTM's will feature signature sinister takes on Red Light/Green Light mechanics.</em></p>
<p>A lot of people also have issues with the game having premium battle passes due to the fact that a significant amount of people who purchased the game would have paid at least $70 for it rather than playing it via Xbox Game Pass for the long haul. Seeing a paid game with a ton of microtransactions is never a great feeling, and it makes more sense for the event pass to be in Call of Duty: Warzone, as that is the free-to-play Battle Royale set in the CoD universe.</p>
<p>It hasn't been specified how much this pass will cost as of yet, but as the event looms closer, there will most likely be new details given about the event and the rewards that you will be able to obtain by participating.</p>
<p>Will you be getting the battle pass for the Squid Game event?</p>
