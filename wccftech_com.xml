			<p>Greedfall developer Spiders has laid off most of the animation team, according to Lead Animator Erwan Perrin, who wrote the following message <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erwan-perrin_hey-weve-recently-been-informed-that-activity-7353013917415079936-aKPM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Hey! We’ve recently been informed that, like most of the Industry, Spiders Games will proceed a layoff plan and sadly most of the Animation and Rig team will be affected …If you're looking for some talented and passionated Paris based Animator or a Rig Artist, hit me up.</em></p>



<p>It is unfortunately only the latest instance of a seemingly unending wave of layoffs, from the largest companies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. shutting down Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB Games San Diego</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA laying off between 300 and 400 employees including at Respawn and Codemasters</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft shutting down The Initiative</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">canceling the new MMO in development at ZeniMax Online Studios</a>) to mid-sized ones like <a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/">Supermassive</a> and now Spiders, too.</p>



<p>Greedfall 2: The Dying World hasn't done well since <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-releases-september-24-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its launch in early access</a>, that's for sure. The game 'peaked' at 375 concurrent players on Steam, but it is barely being played at this point, with yesterday's daily peak registered at a mere 10 players. User reviews are also very negative—the total sits at 55%, but the recent reviews are even lower rated (40%).</p>



<p>One of the main sticking points for most of the community and, indeed, the undersigned, is the combat system, which was changed from the real-time action of the first Greedfall to a tab-targeting-like combat reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins or MMOs like World of Warcraft. Spiders has since taken steps to improve the feel of the combat through better animations and sounds, but the core remained the same, and it definitely <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt very dated</a>. It's a shame, as the first Greedfall <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/greedfall-spiders-levelling-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a fun and well-made action RPG</a> that warranted a proper sequel.</p>
