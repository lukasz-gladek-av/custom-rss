			<p>Nintendo is well known for the litigious lengths it will go to, and its legal battle against Palworld developer PocketPair is just the latest major example of the company's legal team pushing things as far as they can. </p>



<p>It <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">launched its suit almost exactly a year ago</a> at the time of this writing, and as the battle has ensued, Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">changed the patents</a> it claims PocketPair is infringing to try to better align them with its arguments, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-new-patent-should-not-have-happened-says-lawyer-palworld/">successfully acquired new patents</a> to better stack its claims, and now, the latest argument being made to answer PocketPair's attempt to use game mods as part of their defense, is that game mods don't count as "<em>prior art</em>."</p>



<p>This report comes from <a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">Gamesfray</a>, which has followed the suit closely for months now. Essentially, PocketPair pointed to game mods as a way of trying to cut the legs off of Nintendo's claims. Nintendo responded by arguing that game mods are not prior art, because a mod for a game only works with that game, and doesn't run independently from it.</p>



<p>Nintendo would have the judge see mods as patentable by other parties, making Nintendo vulnerable to others taking ideas from Nintendo titles, patenting them, and using them in other games. That's why Nintendo wants the judge to believe mods don't count as "<em>prior art</em>."</p>



<p>The potential ramifications of Nintendo securing a win with these arguments are pretty scary when you consider how far it could take such a precedent. We'd likely see even more legal action from Nintendo going after people who just wanted to make a cool mod, who put hours of their time and effort into creating an original mod for others to enjoy. And that's just on a smaller, individual scale. </p>



<p>Of course, that's if Nintendo is successful with these arguments. We've yet to hear what the judge presiding over the case has to say about what has been presented so far, and Gamesfray predicts that we won't hear any major updates for the remainder of the year.</p>



<p>Still, what's certain is that the outcome of this suit will have a major impact on the videogame industry, whichever way it goes.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4 </a>works wonders on Steam Deck, introducing significant image quality improvements in select games that make the performance hit more than worth it in most cases.</p>



<p>New comparison videos shared online by Deck Wizard compare <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> running on Steam Deck with AMD FSR 4 and FSR 3.1.5. The side-by-side comparison of both games highlights how the new version of the upscaler, which has only recently unofficially become available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">Steam Deck</a>, delivers significantly cleaner and sharper image quality than its predecessor, making the performance hit well worth it in most cases. While both games are best experienced at 60 FPS - especially Stellar Blade, given its action-focused gameplay—the improvements already visible at this early stage suggest that FSR 4's implementation on the handheld platform has strong potential and may only get better with further optimization.</p>

<p>AMD FSR 4 is the first version of the upscaler to go the full <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-fidelityfx-super-resolution-ai-follows-nvidia-dlss-intel-xess-better-visual-fidelity/">"AI" route</a>, following NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS in using machine learning to improve image quality and performance of modern games. Initially only available for RX 9000 series GPUs, workarounds have been discovered to use the new version of the upscaler on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-3-gpus-run-fsr-4/">RDNA 3</a> and RDNA 2 through a leaked INT8 version of FSR 4's source code, which can be manually implemented using tools like <a href="https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler">OptiScaler</a>. Although with a performance hit, the upscaler still delivers significantly better image quality on this old hardware.</p>

			<p>Team Reptile, the studio behind the Jet Set Radio-inspired Bomb Rush Cyberfunk has just revealed its next game, Hyperfunk, which looks to be another fast-paced, music-infused, combo-focused rush. It'll be coming to PC and consoles when it's ready, but at the time of this writing, no release date or release window has been announced.</p>



<p>The news came from Team Reptile's <a href="https://team-reptile.com/hyperfunk-reveal/">website</a>, with a post that included a short description of the game and a teaser trailer, showing off a small snippet of gameplay.</p>



<p>"<em>Team Reptile's new game is called Hyperfunk</em>," the post reads. "<em>An extreme trick and graffiti game in which the higher your combo score, the faster you can boost. Follow the story of a crew called MACH10 and compete with the other crews in dynamic style wars or hang out online with friends</em>."</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's clear from the trailer that Team Reptile is working to further refine what it did in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, focusing once again on fluid movement and trick-centric gameplay. It'll be interesting to see how else Hyperfunk evolves on the studio's previous work, and hopefully, we'll have a release date to look forward to soon.</p>



<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-the-funk-is-with-ya/">reviewed Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> when it launched back in 2023, we wrote "<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is a game that's clearly wearing its inspiration on its sleeve. With mechanics that are pretty easy to get into and a great soundtrack to boot, fans of Jet Set Radio and 3D platformer games in general should feel very pleased. While the game has some shortcomings that prevent it from being a masterpiece, it still delivers some memorable beats.</em>"</p>

			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4</a> PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing significant emulation improvements for select games.</p>



<p>The 0.11.0 version, which can now be downloaded from the emulator's official website, introduces several technical changes and improvements that, by themselves, don't mean much to any regular user for the most part. In reality, these mark a significant improvement for the emulator regarding Unreal Engine-powered games, as many now boot on the emulator, and some are even in a playable state, although it will take a while to see the most advanced games run well on the emulator due to how technically demanding the engine is to emulate with complex shader pipelines and more. You can learn more about these changes with the official <a href="https://shadps4.net/post/shadps4-v0110-relased/">update notes.</a></p>



<p>The ShadPS4 emulator is the most advanced PlayStation 4 emulator available, and the one that is making the fastest progress among those in development. In just a few weeks last year, FromSoftware's Bloodborne, one of the most popular PlayStation 4 exclusive games that have yet to be ported to any other system, went from <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">barely bootable</a> to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">fully playable even on dated systems</a> with better visuals and performance, thanks to the hard work of modders such as fromsoftserve who released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">visual overhaul </a>that is on par with many official remasters released in the past. After focusing on improving Bloodborne's emulation as much as possible, the emulator's developers have moved onto other PlayStation 4 exclusives, which the emulator is running better and better with each new release.</p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>
