			<p>It has been a while since new information was unearthed regarding the HLX project at Valve, which is thought to be Half-Life 3. Despite the lack of new details, however, work on the project seems to have been proceeding steadily, and development may have reached the final phase, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>In new videos shared yesterday by Tyler McViker and Gabe Follower, it is reported that Counter-Strike 2's massive July 29 update not only brought changes and improvements to the competitive game but also some behind-the-scenes changes to the Source 2 engine related to the Half-Life 3 HLX project. One new line of code in particular, the one mentioning thumpers to scare antlions, which mirrors a line of code in Half-Life 2, seems to be a direct message to dataminers, and further confirmation that the project continues to be in active development.</p>



<p>Not only does the HLX project continue to be in active development, but it may have reached the final phase of development. The most significant change introduced in the new Source 2 engine update is the complete refactoring of AI scripting in the FGD and localization token files. This is pretty significant, as this refactoring has changed how NPCs react to in-game events, going from sounds to what are not called AI events. This has been known to be an HLX feature for a while, but the difference now is that there's a definition file for these AI events, which suggests that the feature is done and polished up to a point that it can be used in scripting and map-making. Hammer, Valve's level design tool, was also recently updated to support many of the Half-Life 3 HLX features discovered in the past few months via datamining, such as vehicle mechanics, wind mechanics, model deformation, thermodynamics mechanics, and more. The fact that the new documentation reads like a tutorial to explain how to use the development tools properly to take advantage of these features also adds more fuel to the fire and even suggests how mod support could be coming not too long after the project launches. Ultimately, this sort of polishing and development tool updates usually happen at the end of development, but considering how differently Valve operates compared to the vast majority of game developers, it cannot be said for certain if the game is close to being announced and released.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other recent happenings may also suggest that the HLX project thought to be Half-Life 3 could be in the final phase of development. Gabe Follower claims in their video that some parts of the project are already finished and need only to be polished, and developers have started moving on to other projects. Usually, this means the project may have been abandoned, but Gabe Follower believes these developers are moving on to other projects because their work on HLX is no longer needed.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, Valve operates differently from other game development studios, so even if the game is in the final phase of development, an announcement and release timeline for the HLX project, thought to be Half-Life 3, remains unknown. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to learn more about what's next for one of gaming's most celebrated series. </p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening of pre-orders</a>, Electronic Arts has also shared the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for Battlefield 6, and they are relatively mild for a 2025 Frostbite game that looks this good. It will also 'only' require 75GB of your drive's space at launch, and the game even runs on a traditional HDD.</p>

<p>Of course, at this time, we don't know if there will be any support for ray tracing effects, although it would be weird if not. After all, Battlefield V was <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-bfv-nvidia-rtx/">one of the very first games to support NVIDIA RTX</a>, specifically for reflections. The support of PC upscalers like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel is practically a guarantee, though.</p>

<p>While we wait for more technical details, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kai's first impressions with the game</a> from the Battlefield 6 reveal event in Los Angeles. We also have a few gameplay captures that should give you an inkling of how the latest entry in DICE's military first-person shooter series will actually play.</p>

<p>It won't be long until the open beta hits, though, with the first weekend scheduled to go live in just eight days. </p>

			<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly financials</a> just delivered an update on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 sales</a>. According to the Big N, the hardware has now exceeded a sell-through of six million units in the seven weeks after launch. By the end of the quarter that ended in June, the Nintendo Switch 2 had sold 5.82 million units. Software sales for the platform have reached 8.67 million units in total, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> unsurprisingly taking up the lion's share (5.63 million units, nearly one per Switch 2 buyer).</p>



<p>Nintendo recognized the existing supply issue:</p>



<p><em>Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers. We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible.</em></p>



<p>The previous conservative forecast of 15 million Switch 2 units and 45 million software units sold in fiscal year 2026 remains unchanged. </p>



<p>Net sales predictably boomed in this first quarter compared to last year, from 246.6 billion yen ($1.6 billion) to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion), marking a 132.1% increase. However, the IP related business decreased slightly this quarter (from 17.5 billion yen to 16.7 billion yen, a 4.4% downgrade) due to decreased revenue related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 6 & PlayStation Handheld Specs Leaked – Rasterization Performance Estimated to be 3X and 0.5X of PS5, Respectively]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-%E2%80%93-rasterization-performance-estimated-to-be-3x-and-0-5x-of-ps5-respectively.1259334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Monday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> on the PlayStation 6 and PlayStation handheld codenames (Orion and Canis), YouTube Moore's Law Is Dead (MLID) has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tym6xxCKvHg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> specs for both upcoming consoles from a leaked 2023 AMD presentation.</p>



<p>According to the leaks, Sony is going for a relatively conservative system. Its main goal will be keeping power lower than a base PlayStation 5, with the target being 160W TBP. The console will employ a chiplet design, with 8 Zen 6 cores and between 40 and 48 RDNA 5 Compute Units clocked at over 3GHz.</p>



<p>These are fewer Compute Units than the 60 available for the PlayStation 5 Pro, but they will run much faster. Moreover, RDNA 5 is expected to bring a noticeable improvement in IPC performance, so each Compute Unit will deliver more performance than the CUs in the PS5 Pro. </p>



<p>The memory also has a lower bus than the PS5 Pro (160 or 192 bit compared to the PS5 Pro's 256 bit), but it will be powered by the much faster GDDR7, allowing it to reach clocks of 32Gbps for an estimated bandwidth of 640GB/s-768GB/s, depending on the final bus spec. That's higher than the PS5 Pro's bandwidth of 576GB/s.</p>



<p>Overall, the estimation is that rasterization performance will be over three times that of the base PlayStation 5 and around double that of the newer PlayStation 5 Pro. That would place the performance level of the PlayStation 6 roughly around a GeForce RTX 4080, although of course, it's never quite an apples-to-apples comparison when measuring consoles and PC GPUs directly. The uplift of ray tracing performance should be much higher (6-10x), thanks to the expected advancements AMD will bring in the area. </p>



<p>Backward compatibility is expected to be maintained for PS5 and PS4. The production phase should begin in mid-2027, with an estimated release in stores in late 2027 or early 2028 for a price of around $499.</p>



<p>As for the Project Canis handheld, it should use a monolithic 3nm die equipped with 4 Zen 6C cores. The GPU is expected to have between 12 and 20 RDNA 5 Compute Units clocked between 1.6 and 2.2GHz. The memory will equip a 128-bit bus with LPDDR5X 7500 RAM. Sony is reportedly targeting a 15-watt thermal board power.</p>



<p>Rasterization performance should be around half that of the base PlayStation 5, but thanks to the advancements brought by the RDNA 5 architecture, the uplift of ray tracing performance should be higher. The handheld should also feature backward compatibility with PS4 and PS5, microSD and M.2 SSD storage support, haptic feedback, dual microphones, a touchscreen, and a USB-C port supporting fast charging and video output.</p>



<p>Overall, it should easily outperform the Xbox Ally X. However, that's not saying much since that handheld is launching soon, and the PlayStation handheld is instead targeting a similar launch window to its bigger sibling, the PlayStation 6. Pricing estimates put it around $400 or $500.</p>



<p>Moore's Law Is Dead also briefly touched upon the next-generation Xbox console, whose codename is Magnus. It should be equipped with 11 Zen 6 cores and 68 Compute Units, proving to be more powerful than the PS5 Pro but not quite a match for the PlayStation 6. However, it should launch sooner than that, which resonates with <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous rumors</a> that Microsoft might be looking to try a repeat of the Xbox 360 situation, which debuted one year before the PlayStation 3 and was Xbox's most successful console to date. Still, the YouTuber says the new Xbox console won't be available before 2027.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the specs came from an old presentation. Therefore, specific details might have changed since. We won't know the official specs until well into 2026, at the very least. Until then, stay tuned.</p>
