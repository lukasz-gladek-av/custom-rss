			<p><strong>Embark Studios</strong> has revealed a new roadmap for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>,</strong> covering the first four months of the year with what it has deemed to be the game's <strong>Escalation</strong> period. The roadmap includes new map conditions, new ARC threats incoming, new Raider Decks, a map update, and, perhaps most exciting of all, a <strong>new map</strong> scheduled to arrive in April.</p>



<p>"<em>2026 is upon us, and we're embarking on our first full year of ARC Raiders. Let's do this thing,</em>" the studio writes in the opening of a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">new blog post on the game's website</a>. "<em>As we head into 2026, we're excited to share our roadmap for the next four months. This will show you the types of new content to look forward to: new enemies, maps, conditions, or other changes</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Stick around. After Escalation, <strong>there's even more to come</strong></em>."</p>

<p>If you're a PvP-focused player, then the first thing to take note of is the new matchmaking option to only match with players who are also <strong>level 40 and up</strong>. It should help make more of your fights more interesting, since it can get boring for the level 40+ player to keep boot-stomping low-level players with little to no good loot, while players below level 40 get frustrated and potentially stop playing because they can't engage in PvP without getting automatically boot-stomped.</p>



<p>It's good to know that we'll have new ARCs entering the fray to keep enemy variety when you jump into a session a little more lively, and new map conditions coming as soon as later this month to keep the exploration and survival aspect of the gameplay interesting. It's also exciting to know that along with the new map coming in April, we'll also get a new "<em>large ARC</em>," indicating there will be another, potentially Matriarch-level ARC to fight on the new map.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has been the hottest new game on the market in the last few months, skyrocketing to being one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">2025's best-selling titles towards the end of the year,</a> with no signs of slowing down, as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">it hasn't even fallen below <strong>100K</strong> concurrent players on Steam</a> since it launched. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Somehow, Beyond Good & Evil 2 Survived Ubisoft’s “Major Reset,” Claims it Remains a “Unique Proposition” Among Fantasy Genre]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The biggest news of the week is undoubtedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>Ubisoft</strong> undergoing a <strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>" as a company</a>, shaking up its portfolio by cancelling six projects, including the <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, delaying <strong>seven other projects</strong>, and <strong>spinning up four new IPs</strong>; and that's just what we know happened to its portfolio. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><strong>The whole structure of the company</strong> was shifted around to boot</a>, but through all of this mess, one long-running project survived: <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong>.</p>



<p>A game that was said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-evil-2-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release/">"<em>years away from release</em>"</a> after it had already been in production for <strong>14 years at the time of that report</strong> (which itself is now <strong>four years old</strong>) is still worth burning money on, according to Ubisoft. In fact, the company still believes that the game has something to offer that makes it a "<em>unique proposition</em>" when compared to other modern fantasy games.</p>



<p>"<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on open world adventures</em>," a Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-long-in-the-works-beyond-good-and-evil-2-a-unique-proposition-in-the-open-world-adventure-market-studio-says">Eurogamer</a>, before continuing to say that fans of fantasy games are "<em>underserved</em>," and that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains a "<em>unique proposition</em>" for players.</p>



<p>We've known about Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 being in development at Ubisoft since <strong>2008</strong>, when it was first publicly revealed. Since then, the last time <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-revealed/">we saw an official trailer for it was at <strong>E3 2017</strong></a>. And while Ubisoft deemed the six to seven years spent on the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake were ultimately unsalvageable, the <strong>nearly 18 years it has spent on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> clearly aren't in the minds of Ubisoft leadership. They were <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-still-hiring-beyond-good-and-evil-2/">even hiring people for the project <strong>as recently as last November</strong></a>.</p>



<p>(<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">This is the same leadership that led the company to lose <strong>95% of its value in the last eight years.)</strong></a></p>



<p>Ultimately, who knows if this game will ever come out. If it does, and it's a hit, that's great for Ubisoft and for the people who will have likely been waiting a full <strong>20 years</strong> for it to release. But it's more likely that no matter the quality of the final release, no game, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 included, can live up to the expectations of a 20-year development period. If anything, you might find more people expecting the worst after it remained gestating for that long.</p>



<p>The fact that people are still working on it, and that there are still players waiting on it, is a testament to the mark left by the first game, which you can thankfully still go and play, and will be able to play for many more years now that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-to-launch-on-june-25/">remaster of <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong> is available</a>. But with every passing year, the idea of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 releasing as a 'masterpiece of a video game worth the two-decade wait' is a pitch that becomes less and less convincing.</p>



<p>And that's all without mentioning the real kicker in all of this: by the time it comes out (if that day ever arrives), will anyone actually care? Which is to say, it's always a gamble when trying to bring back something old and make today's consumers who didn't grow up with it care about that thing.</p>



<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has been in development long enough to go to college, and it wouldn't be a surprise if today's generation of young players, who are more interested in playing 'forever games' like <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/"><strong>Roblox, Fortnite,</strong> <strong>Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong></a>, couldn't care less about a game from over a decade ago they've only heard of in passing, if they've heard of it at all.</p>

			<p><strong>Nintendo </strong>has officially announced the first <strong>Nintendo Direct</strong> event for 2026, and it's kicking off the year by showcasing what could be its best-selling product: <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>. The sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">the billion-dollar box-office hit</a> is due to hit theatres this coming <strong>April 3, 2026,</strong> and we're going to get another look at it this coming <strong>Sunday, January 25,</strong> when Nintendo debuts the second <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</strong> at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>.</p>



<p>The announcement was first made through the <strong>Nintendo Today!</strong> app, before hitting all of Nintendo's official social media channels. As per usual, the news also came with an obligatory notice telling fans to "<em>Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation</em>." </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This will be our third look at the film, going back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">its initial teaser in <strong>September 2025</strong></a> and its first dedicated direct back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-shows-new-trailer-brie-larson-benny-safdie/">November 2025</a></strong>. In the last direct, we got a look at two characters joining the film franchise: Rosalina, who will be played by <strong>Brie Larson</strong>, and Bowser Jr., who will be played by <strong>Benny Safdie</strong>.</p>



<p>For Sunday's direct, while nothing is necessarily guaranteed, we will almost certainly get a look a <strong>Yoshi</strong> and the actor behind the green dinosaur. In the run-up to the last direct, just two days before it officially premiered, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/"><strong>a collaboration with Pilsbury</strong> spoiled our first look at Yoshi's design for the film</a>, and spoiled the confirmation of Bowser Jr. as one of the new characters being introduced.</p>



<p>We've known that Yoshi was going to be involved in this sequel since the first movie came out, thanks to a cliffhanger tease at the end of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, so seeing the character as part of a promotional collaboration wasn't the biggest surprise, but we've yet to see him in motion in the film. Now that we're nearly a full month into 2026, and the film's April premiere date is fast approaching, it feels like this Sunday will be when we get to see the green dinosaur in action in the film for the first time.</p>
