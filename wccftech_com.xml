			<p>Today, Hangar 13 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amarmiKaV2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a new developer diary detailing the making of Mafia: The Old Country. The developer revealed that it has partnered with Stormind Games, an Italian studio known for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remothered-broken-porcelain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/batora-lost-haven-bathing-in-shadows-to-reach-dim-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batora: Lost Haven</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>. Stormind is based in Sicily and helped Hangar 13 make Mafia: The Old Country as authentic as possible. Here are a few quotes from the video interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Salvo Fallica, Senior Project Manager at Stormind Games:</strong> Our priority has always been to ensure that everything in the game feels authentic. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matthew Aitken, Lead Writer at Hangar 13:</strong> The details are absolutely key in keeping the immersion of the player. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Alex Cox, Game Director at Hangar 13:</em></strong><em> We need to make sure that the game is grounded in the real history of the Sicilian Mafia.&nbsp;</em><em>Experts in their field are able to kind of help us contextualize things that we read in the stuff that we see on the screen with real lived experiences. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Steve Noakes, Art Director at Hangar 13:</strong> When it comes to something like the knives in the game, there's very little reference that's available for that. Right? And so really we had to dig very deep. We went into some tiny little backwater of a machine shop where this guy and his son were still crafting knives by hand, imbuing them with their particular regional styles, known for their thumbprints, if you like, of their particular approach to building knives. We just wouldn't really experienced that any other way.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jakub Vavrik, Associate Art Director at Hangar 13:</strong> Previous Mafia games were more or less city heavy, and now we are moving to more organic wildlife setting of Sicily.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Alex Cox:</strong> A very realistic, high fidelity, authentic setting. It really feels like we're transporting you back to 1900 Sicily. That's what Mafia players really expect from one of our games. Players will form a relationship with Sicily over the course of this game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Steve Noakes:</strong> The landscape is always a character in any Mafia game. I think that's especially true of this location and of this time period and setting. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Alex</strong> <strong>Cox:</strong> The promise is to play a classic mob movie. That's the game that you're going to play, allowing players to really imagine themselves back in that time and playing through the game as a Sicilian gangster. I hope players find it as exciting as we do</em></p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch on August 8</a> at $50. Unlike its predecessor, it's a strictly narrative-driven game.

			<p>Gearbox Software president Randy Pitchford recently caught the ire of players regarding the potential price of Borderlands 4 when he told one person <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">on X that a "real fan"</a> would find a way to pay $80 for the upcoming game if that ended up being the price.</p>
<p>This all started during <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-announces-new-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-and-digs-into-more-details-on-borderlands-4-at-pax-east-2025/">PAX East</a>, when Pitchford was asked what the price of Borderlands 4 would be while Gearbox was presenting on the main stage. Pitchford's answer boiled down to "<em>I don't know</em>," and gave a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">long speech</a> about why he didn't know and couldn't give an exact answer about the price, how it's not his decision what the price ends up being, and the many variables that go into pricing a video game.</p>
<p>If he hadn't taken it further than his speech at PAX East, the story of Borderlands 4's pricing would have stopped there, and it wouldn't have come up again until the game's price was officially revealed. But, in response to a player telling Pitchford that, "<em><span>alot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag</span></em><span>," he <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-says-a-real-fan-will-find-a-way-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-if-that-ends-up-being-the-price/">responded in a way that many deemed to be condescending</a>, using an example of how when he was a kid, he put in the extra work at his minimum wage ice cream shop job to pay for a game he was looking forward to.<br>
</span></p>
<p>He's recently apologized for that response, but not in a way where he necessarily takes ownership for what he said. Instead, Pitchford apologized for the "<em>misunderstanding</em>" of his comments.</p>
<p>"<em><span>I am sorry there was a misunderstanding. The absolute sincere truth is that I don’t want anyone to pay any more than they should or are comfortable with and I always work with the intent and hope that a customer always feels they got the better end of the deal no matter what they</span></em><span><em> pay</em>,</span>" is how he began what is a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1927802548326650365">very long post on X.</a></p>
<p>Pitchford went on to explain that he believes he "<em>triggered some people</em>" when he used the phrase "<em>real fans,</em>" and that he was in no way making "<em>some big</em> <em>statement,</em>" or that he "<em><span>was taking the audience for granted</span></em>."</p>
<p>A quick scroll through the replies to his apology makes it clear that it did not land with fans the way Pitchford might've hoped. He tries to sound sincere, but as the first reply makes clear, he loses players right from the top, by apologizing for the misunderstanding, instead of just apologizing for what he said, and moving on to his "<em>sincere truth</em>" that he wants anyone who buys his games that they feel like they got the better deal "<em>no matter what they pay</em>."</p>
<p>Video game pricing is currently a sore spot for players, with Mario Kart World officially kicking up the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">potential standard to $80</a>, and the fear that every new, current-generation game will be priced at that new threshold. It's already believed that Take-Two will (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto">at the very least</a>) match Mario Kart World's pricing when they release Grand Theft Auto VI next May.</p>
<p>$70 became the standard only a few short years ago, following the launch of the current-gen consoles. The rest of the industry quickly jumping to $80 is something that players are fearful of, especially when the price of actual life essentials (food, shelter) is going up around the world.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-3-leaked-september-13th/">Borderlands 3</a> came out in 2019, it did so at the then-standard $60 price. It's unlikely that Borderlands 4 will come in at anything less than $70, but it'll be interesting to see how players vote with their wallets when it comes to the seemingly inevitable wave of $80 games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and Limbo Are Free on the Epic Games Store]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-and-limbo-are-free-on-the-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tiny-tina%E2%80%99s-wonderlands-and-limbo-are-free-on-the-epic-games-store.1201890/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-and-limbo-are-free-on-the-epic-games-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next two free games up for grabs as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store 2025 Mega Sale</a> are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/limbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limbo</a>.</p>
<p>The first game is the 2022 spin-off of the Borderlands series, built as a sequel of sorts to Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, a Borderlands 2 DLC. The premise is completely different and more familiar to fans of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons: the titular Tiny Tina is the dungeon master of a fictional tabletop RPG called Bunkers &amp; Badasses, and the twist is that she can modify the game world on the fly at her whim.</p>
<p>The game turned out to be quite successful in terms of sales (which exceeded the expectations of publisher Take-Two) and average critic score. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands earned an 8.5/10 score here on Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Rosh Kelly</a>:</p>
<p><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, with its fantasy setting, tabletop homage, and constant references, takes the world exploration in a different direction. For the first time in the Borderlands IP, players will have an overworld to wander through, complete with side quests and secrets. This travel by map can make the locations feel a bit unconnected, but it also allows for a huge variety of places to delve into. And once you’ve reached your location, you’ll have the full experience you’re used to.</em></p>
<p>The other game gamers can grab for free this week on the Epic Games Store is Limbo, the masterpiece puzzle/platform/horror indie game released in 2010. Limbo was developed by Playdead, a Danish studio also known for 2016's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/inside-review-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside</a>. In the game, an unnamed boy roams traps and dangerous environments in the desperate search for his sister. Limbo received multiple awards and accolades, winning the coveted Game of the Year prize at the Game Developers Choice Awards and BAFTA Video Game Awards in 2010.</p>
<p>As usual, both games are available to be permanently added to your Epic Games Store library as long as you grab them before next Thursday at 5 PM.</p>
