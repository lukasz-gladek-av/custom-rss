			<p>When NO LAW was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-law-from-makers-of-the-ascent-is-a-first-person-open-world-shooter-rpg-remiscent-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at The Game Awards 2025, it was hard not to draw a comparison with CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077. The new project from Neon Giant, the studio behind The Ascent, is also set in a cyberpunk city, and it's a single player first-person open world shooter RPG, much like the more famous game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-celebrates-5th-anniversary-heavy-dsicount-new-trading-card-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently celebrated its fifth anniversary</a>.</p>



<p>In the first post-reveal interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-developers-of-no-law-know-everyone-will-compare-it-to-cyberpunk-2077-but-there-are-important-differences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Neon Giant Co-Founder and Creative Director Tor Frick acknowledged the comparison but also explained why NO LAW is going to be a lot different from Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p><em>I think obviously every day we have to do that internally as well. Because we know what Cyberpunk is and we know people will compare us. But the game is very different and the world is very different. A lot of it is, it's just the mood and the tone. Cyberpunk is a big, sprawling experience. It's a mega city. And our game is a lot more intimate both when it comes to the gameplay mechanics but also the world. I think as people see more of the game that will be more apparent. It's hard to do in a short trailer like that. I think you need to see and feel the game more. It is more of an intimate experience, like the world is deep but not so grand. And the same thing with mechanics and the same thing with the story. It is very, very personal and very, very reactive around you as a player, rather than being set in this grand backdrop.</em></p>



<p>The studio's other Co-Founder and Creative Director, Arcade Berg, added that NO LAW also features a slight tongue-in-cheek tone like The Ascent, in contrast to Cyberpunk 2077's far more serious vibe. Other inspirations include 80s-90s action movies, which were also a bit campy, as well as Hong Kong action scenes, and even manga and anime.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, the main character, Grey Harker, is a seasoned veteran who chooses to retire from active military service following the severe injuries sustained during his previous deployment to pursue a life of peace. He had abandoned violence in favor of caring for his plants, but eventually, trouble walked through his door all the same, a bit like in John Wick, prompting him to return and make those who had wronged him pay.</p>



<p>The game is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X with no set release window. It will be published by KRAFTON, which acquired Neon Giant a few years ago.</p>

			<p>There's little doubt that CAPCOM crafted a successful roadmap of releases for its Resident Evil franchise, expertly alternating some of the most requested remakes of classic titles with brand new entries.</p>



<p>Following the gamble (won) of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and its first-person view, CAPCOM dropped the remakes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3</a> in consecutive years (2019-2020). The first one enjoyed universal acclaim and record-breaking sales, eventually becoming the best-selling game in the franchise (and CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time after Monster Hunter World and Rise) with 16.30 million units, as last reported by the publisher. Resident Evil 3 was received slightly worse, with criticism focusing on its short length, the omission of content from the original, and the scripted set pieces. Even so, the game recently cracked CAPCOM's Top 10 best-selling chart, having sold 10.30 million units at the last update.</p>



<p>The studio then launched another new entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Village</a>, in May 2021, concluding the narrative of RE7. This one fell somewhere in the middle between the remakes of 2 and 3 in terms of reception and sales. According to CAPCOM's latest financial report, Village has sold 12.30 million units to date. </p>



<p>Two years later, the Japanese developer released the remake of the most acclaimed installment in the whole series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>. It was another success on the level of the remake of RE2, earning awards and becoming the fastest-selling game in the series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-breaks-10-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It broke the 10 million units milestone this April</a> and yet CAPCOM reported that it's already at 11.10 million units now. At this rate, it should easily overtake Village over time.</p>



<p>All eyes are rightfully on Resident Evil Requiem right now, as the ninth chapter in the mainline series is less than two and a half months away from launch. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA 2025 confirmation</a> that Leon would be a playable character, roughly splitting the game with the other protagonist, Grace, further excited fans.</p>



<p>But CAPCOM is already working on the next remakes, in its bid to keep a constant stream of Resident Evil releases. The community has long requested a remake of Code Veronica, which was originally a Dreamcast exclusive. Three years ago, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-is-a-maybe-given-the-opportunity-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it may be considered, given the opportunity. </p>



<p>Last year, CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that the developers were crafting not only a Code Veronica remake, but also a Resident Evil Zero remake. IGN quickly corroborated the story. Now, Dusk Golem, fresh from the victory of being vindicated for the long-time prediction of Leon as a playable character in Requiem, has <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1999738896800973030#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> on the status of both remakes. Code Veronica is expected to be announced next year for a planned 2027 launch, whereas Zero is scheduled to release in 2028 (and will presumably be announced in 2027). This would follow a similar output to the RE2 and 3 remake, which were released in quick succession.</p>



<p>In Code Veronica, the narrative unfolds three months after the events of Resident Evil 2, following the sibling protagonists, Claire and Chris Redfield, as they try to survive a viral outbreak at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. Resident Evil Zero, on the other hand, is chronologically the earliest game in the series, being a prequel to the first installment. In this game, the player switches between two characters, S.T.A.R.S. officer Rebecca Chambers and convict Billy Coen, as they explore an abandoned training facility for employees of the pharmaceutical company Umbrella, located on the outskirts of Raccoon City.</p>
