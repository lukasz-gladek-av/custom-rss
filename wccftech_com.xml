			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/01/xbox-game-pass-july-2025-wave-1/">announced</a> the monthly Game Pass additions for July 2025, and there's little doubt that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 will be the highlight.</p>



<p>The long-awaited remake of the skateboarding series' third and fourth mainline installments will launch on July 11. On that same day, the games will become available to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers on Xbox consoles, PC, and cloud. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/sgf-2025-tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previewed</a> Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 at Summer Game Fest 2025; here's an excerpt from his hands-on:</p>



<p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4’s biggest change in the hands-on preview, beyond the obvious exclusion of the free-form career mode from THPS4, is backporting all the gameplay and mechanical changes from the fourth numbered entry back into THPS3. This means grind extensions, leveling out, and even skitching are all on the menu for Foundry and Airport. It consolidates the two numbered entries into a single launcher and menu, combining both games into a $49.99 package. Activision tipped us off about some of the other brand-new features coming to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, including new modes like Photo Mode and HAWK, but also the ability to create custom goals in Create-a-Park. However, I wasn’t able to check all of these out, given our limited time to get hands-on.</em></p>



<p>Starting today, Game Pass subscribers at all tiers can play Little Nightmares II (the new installment is coming out soon) and Rise of the Tomb Raider. Starting tomorrow, Square Enix's Legend of Mana and Trials of Mana will be available to Game Pass Standard subscribers on Xbox consoles. On July 3, the party platformer game Ultimate Chicken Horse will be added to all GP tiers and supported platforms, while the co-op action shooter RPG The Ascent will be added on July 8. The following day, the indie casual management sim will be available on all platforms to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Last but not least, the first-person shooter High on Life returns to Microsoft's subscription service on July 15 and will be available to all tiers.</p>
