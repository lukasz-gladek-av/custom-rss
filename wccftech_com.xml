			<p>Bandai Namco isn't done talking about what it has coming down the pipeline, as the company announced it will host its own Bandai Namco Summer Showcase this week on <strong>July 2, 2025, at 12pm PT/3pm ET/8pm BT.</strong> </p>



<p>The showcase will feature more information on a number of titles Bandai Namco is publishing, including news on the recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/code-vein-ii/">Code Vein II</a>, the upcoming RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/">Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> from former CD Projekt RED developers at their new studio Rebel Wolves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tekken-8/">Tekken 8</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/little-nightmares-iii/">Little Nightmares III</a>, and Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, to name a few of the 12 games from Bandai's portfolio that'll be shown off.</p>



<p>Chief among the 12 titles being shown in this showcase is the one that we know very little about, as Bandai Namco is set to premiere a brand-new My Hero Acadedmia title at this Wednesday's showcase. </p>

<p>Here's the full list of titles Bandai Namco has committed to showing at this Summer Showcase event:</p>

<li>Super Robot Wars Y</li>



<li>Tekken 8</li>



<li>The Blood of the Dawnwalker</li>



<li>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</li>
</ul>



<p>Though this month has already included plenty of new information on titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares III</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-looks-suitably-witchery-in-new-gameplay-overview-2026-launch-confirmed/">The Blood of the Dawnwalker</a>, most of the games on the list are titles that players have been waiting to hear more about.</p>



<p>Plenty of them have release dates, with Super Robot Wars Y, Shadow Labyrinth, and Patapon 1+2 Replay all due out this summer, in August for the former and July for the latter two games. While Digimon Story Time Stranger, Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, and Little Nightmares III are all due out in September and October. </p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll get better looks at gameplay for each of these titles, as some of them are due out in the next few weeks.</p>

			<p>During a recent investor meeting, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa addressed the topic of demand for the newly released Switch 2 console. According to Furukawa, it greatly exceeded Nintendo's internal estimates, which is why you may have had trouble finding it in stores. The president even apologized to customers for the inconvenience. Here's the quote, initially <a href="https://x.com/NStyles/status/1938408070784393520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> by X user NStyles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-president-apologises-for-not-being-able-to-meet-switch-2-demand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translated</a> into English by Nintendo Life:</p>



<p><em>Currently, in many countries, the demand for Switch 2 exceeds the supply, and we are unable to meet it. We understand that some shareholders have also been unable to obtain it. We started accepting lottery sales at My Nintendo Store in April. The response far exceeded our expectations, and I announced in my name on X that there were 2.2 million applicants, along with an apology.</em></p>



<p><em>Since then, we have conducted four lottery sales, but some people were not selected. We have announced that the fifth lottery will take place starting in July. Many general retailers have also conducted lottery sales. The number of stores offering in-store sales is gradually increasing. As a company, we are working to improve our production system to deliver as many units as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this initial demand, which greatly exceeded our expectations.</em></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank">sold</a>&nbsp;over 3.5 million units in the first four days, which is</span> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast</a> as its predecessor in the same timeframe. Last week, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">raised</a> its 2025 sales forecast for the new console from 15 to 16 million units. That estimate does include the limited supply, for without that, DFC Intelligence reckons the Switch 2 could sell 20 million units.</p>
