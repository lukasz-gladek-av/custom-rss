			<p>Nintendo has confirmed that for Nintendo-developed, first-party games for the Nintendo Switch 2, like Mario or Zelda games, the company has "<em>no plans</em>" to release game-key card versions.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">Nintendo Life</a>, Nintendo confirmed that game-key card versions of its first-party developed games are not something it is looking to do. "<em>We have no plans to use game-key cards for Nintendo-developed titles.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-has-great-optimism-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-but-wont-necessarily-bring-all-games-to-the-platform/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is weeks away from launch at the time of writing, and while there's plenty of excitement, there are still plenty of questions and anxieties about how all the changes coming with the console will land.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/">Game-key cards</a> are one of the changes that players aren't happy about. If you didn't know, Game-key cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 are physical cartridges you can buy in your local video game store or online, just as you would any physical copy of a game, but they are not, in any way, a copy of the game you're buying. There's no game data on them; they're just a key, and the game you're buying will be installed on your console through a digital download.</p>
<p>We've seen that before with PlayStation and Xbox game discs, but Nintendo fans, who still buy a significant number of games through physical editions, and with some Nintendo Switch games that have a limited amount of the game's data on the cartridge, with the rest downloaded. But that isn't stopping players from being upset in a whole new way about game-key cards.</p>
<p>At least, for now, we can expect that games like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and whatever the next 3D Mario game is will all be released as proper physical editions, where the game is on the cartridge you buy in a store or online instead of just a key for a digital download.</p>
<p>Of course, the stipulation that Nintendo has no plans to do this for titles that Nintendo develops means that any Nintendo-published titles could still be released as game-key card versions. We should also expect plenty of third-party studios to go the game-key card route instead of spending the extra money to release proper cartridges.</p>

			<p>While most franchise fans are primarily interested in the gameplay of Battlefield 6 for the various multiplayer modes, the game is also going to feature a full-fledged campaign, unlike Battlefield 2042. Earlier this week, Inverse <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/next-battlefield-game-campaign-alex-garland-civil-war-inspired" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to interview</a> some of the lead developers from Motive Studios, the team in charge of the single player story mode, who shared some of the inspirations and themes players will see in the game.</p>
<p>Creative Director Roman Campos-Oriola said:</p>
<p><em>I’m a big fan of Lioness.</em></p>
<p>Executive Producer Philippe Ducharme:</p>
<p><em>I really enjoyed Civil War. Some of the things that we’re pushing [in the Battlefield 6 campaign], the film is actually a good reference.</em></p>
<p>They're referring to Lioness, the American spy action thriller TV show released on Paramount+ with Zoe Saldaña as the main character, and Civil War, Alex Garland's dystopic action thriller movie where a despotic federal government and secessionist movements fight a bloody war within the United States. Both are great examples of action thriller plots, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Campos-Oriola then had this to say about the themes that will be explored in the Battlefield 6 story:</p>
<p><em>The elements we’re really interested in is the concept of talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations. That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we’re looking to capture in the single player.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two discussed how their previous work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Space remake</a> helped them prepare for the Battlefield 6 campaign project.</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> Dead Space allowed us to know the quirks and strengths that we all have, and how we complement each other as a team.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ducharme:</strong> On Dead Space, we talked a lot about the curve of tension. How to go from beat to beat, having the highs and the lows to keep players hooked, and even play with their expectations a little bit. It’s obviously very different in a game like Battlefield. But we still brought that mentality over.</em></p>
<p>Of course, that was a remake, but this time, Motive (which is also helping DICE produce multiplayer maps) had to do everything from scratch.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;this Summer for a launch window scheduled before April 2026.</p>
