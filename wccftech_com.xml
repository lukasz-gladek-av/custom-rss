			<p>Today, <strong>Loric Games</strong> announced the new early access launch date for its upcoming airship-themed cooperative survival RPG, <strong>Echoes of Elysium</strong>. As you might recall, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-early-access-release-date-loric-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to be released on December 4</a>, but there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-gets-last-minute-early-access-delay-to-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last-minute delay to January 2026</a>. The new date has now been set for <strong>January 27</strong>, although there's been no info yet on pricing.</p>



<p>Brian Johnson, the CEO and Co-Founder of Loric Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’re taking Echoes of Elysium to Early Access because we want to build this game with our community. Too often, games are built in a vacuum - developers spend years creating something in isolation, only to find the world doesn’t connect with it. We’re a small team, and rather than disappear for years and release something fully formed without player input, we want to build openly alongside our players. Early Access lets us shape Echoes of Elysium together - a survival RPG where the airship truly is your home, and where you survive and thrive in the skies. We know players joining early may encounter bugs as we continue to improve the game, and we want to reward that trust. This is about creating something together.</em></p>

<p>In a recent blog post published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2644050/view/526490645242578962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the game's Steam page</a>, Loric Games noted that early access is being chosen to make the game alongside the community. As such, systems and features will evolve over time based on the fans' feedback. They also showed some improvements to the animations and combat of Echoes of Elysium. Animations have been smoothed out, and physics are now integrated across all player outfits, constructs, and flying constructs, allowing details such as skirts and capes to trail naturally. The result is a more fluid and dynamic movement for both players and enemies. Thanks to an animation import tool, they also added new wrench attack animations. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> is starting 2026 in a similar fashion to how it started 2025. The Assassin's Creed company shut down its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">Leamington-based studio in January 2025, laying off <strong>185 people</strong></a>. To start 2026, between the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">shuttering of <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong></a> and yesterday's layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/"><strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong></a>, Ubisoft has already laid off an estimated <strong>126 developers</strong>. Now, that number is definitely a little higher, as a new report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio">Game Developer</a> reveals layoffs have continued at <strong>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the report, cuts at the Abu Dhabi studio began back in December 2025 and have continued into the new year, with some staff, like former art director <strong>Daniel Kovacs</strong>, sharing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-kovacs-206b2316a_i-took-some-time-to-reflect-after-being-impacted-activity-7401147823175639040-t3WE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">his personal LinkedIn page last month that he had been laid off</a>. "<em>I took some time to reflect after being impacted by the recent layoffs at Ubisoft Abu Dhabi, and at the risk of sounding a bit sentimental, I just want to say how grateful I am for these three and a half years</em>," wrote Kovacs.</p>



<p>"<em>Signing off as Ubisoft Abu Dhabi's social media manager as I've been affected by the recent layoffs</em>," added <strong>Raiza</strong> <strong>Veridiano</strong>, who also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7400125428398485507-ZyjH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared the news that they had been laid off last month</a>. "<em>I’m incredibly grateful for the 4 years and 9 months I’ve spent here.</em>"</p>



<p>Other former staff, like game support specialist <strong>Zohaib Shafiq</strong>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zshafiq_opentowork-opentowork-ubisoft-activity-7416772579723665409-Xgp6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared the news only yesterday,</a> indicating that the cuts have continued into 2026. "<em>Due to recent restructuring, my journey at</em> <em>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi is coming to an end after an amazing 4.5 years. It’s been a chapter full of learning, collaboration, and growth; I am incredibly grateful for the experiences, challenges, and people that made this chapter so meaningful.</em>"</p>



<p>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi has a team of 60 people, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/locations/abu-dhabi">according to its website</a>, which also calls the studio "<em>Ubisoft’s Regional Hub for games development</em>" in the area. The Abu Dhabi team is responsible for titles like Growtopia and CSI: Hidden Crimes.</p>



<p>According to Ubisoft, these cuts are part of  "<em></em><em>company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>." Last year, the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">established a new branch with <strong>Tencent</strong> called <strong>Vantage Studios</strong></a>, which is now the home to the company's most significant IPs, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It appears that a leak in <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> may have inadvertently revealed the launch date of <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> well ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next week's <strong>Xbox Developer Direct show</strong></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to X user XBOXF10</a>, a pop-up ad revealed that the game will launch on May 19, although early access will start four days early for those who pre-purchase the Premium Edition or get the Premium Upgrade. </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Pre-order now and get a pre-tuned and exclusive Ferrari J50 in Forza Horizon 6!</em> <em>Discover the breathtaking landscapes of Japan in over 550 real-world cars and become a racing Legend in Forza Horizon's biggest open world driving adventure yet.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Pre-order Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition or get the Premium Upgrade featuring:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Early Access - Play 4 days early, starting May 15</em></li>



<li><em>VIP Membership</em></li>



<li><em>Welcome Pack</em></li>



<li><em>Car Pass</em></li>



<li><em>Time Attack Car Pack</em></li>



<li><em>Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)</em></li>



<li><em>2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</em></li>
</ul>



<p>This date follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier rumor from insider Nate the Hate</a>, who claimed that the British developer was targeting the <strong>first half of 2026</strong> for Forza Horizon 6. The studio's other big game slated to appear at the Xbox Developer Direct, <strong>Fable</strong>, might then target a Fall 2026 window.</p>



<p>The sixth entry in the Forza Horizon franchise comes on the heels of the incredible success and acclaim of the fifth installment, which registered <strong>over 50 million players</strong> to date and performed very well even on PlayStation 5. Forza Horizon may have started as an open world arcade spin-off of Forza Motorsport, but over time, it far surpassed Turn 10's more regular race-based simcade series. Now, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Turn 10 layoffs</a>, it is believed that the developer based in Redmond, Washington, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has essentially become a support team for FH</a>, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and will feature <strong>a fantastic open world experience for fans</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased a while ago by the developers</a>. It will be released for PC and Xbox Series S and X consoles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per the original announcement</a>, with a PlayStation 5 version coming at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Former <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> CEO <strong>Robert Kotick</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-stepping-down-end-of-year-matt-booty-taking-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role</a> on <strong>January 1, 2024</strong>, following the company's merger with <strong>Microsoft</strong>. During his last few years in the gaming industry, Kotick's figure became quite controversial, especially when a report from the Wall Street Journal alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-aware-harassment-verbal-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the executive had long been aware of the harassment issues within the company</a> and even <strong>faced personal accusations of wrongdoing against employees</strong>. In one incident, he was reportedly verbally abusive towards an assistant, even threatening to have her killed in a voicemail message, though an Activision Blizzard rep claimed the message was just hyperbolic. In another instance, Kotick reportedly threatened and then fired a flight attendant on his private jet after she accused the pilot of sexual harassment.</p>



<p>That's exactly where the lawsuit filed four years ago by the Swedish pension fund <strong>Sjunde AP-Fonden (AP7)</strong> takes off against Kotick, alleging that the executive (and the Activision Blizzard Board with him) <strong>rushed the sale to leave behind the scandals and the subsequent liability</strong>. AP7 additionally claims that the Board breached its duty of loyalty by choosing a quick exit over the company's long-term value, arguing that the sale price of $95 per share was too low because it was negotiated while the stock was artificially depressed by the ongoing scandals. Furthermore, Kotick himself was entitled to a golden parachute worth hundreds of millions of dollars as part of the deal.</p>



<p>The former Activision CEO begs to differ, as you would expect. To begin with, Kotick <strong>emphasized that Microsoft's offer of $95 per share represented a 45% premium over the stock price at the time of the announcement</strong>. In recent filings, the former executive noted that Activision's actual performance after 2022 fell short of nearly all long-term targets, indicating that the sale was a timely and beneficial exit for investors.</p>



<p>But the latest twist came in the most recent filing (available for reading <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/980767428/Sjunde-AP-Fonden-v-Activision-Blizzard-Inc-Et-Al-2022-1001-No-100949828-Del-Ch-Jan-12-2026?language_settings_changed=English" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Scribd</a>), in which Kotick accused another game publisher, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong>, of somehow colluding with AP7. Here are a few quotes:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Plaintiff’s Board also has ties to a rival video game company, Embracer Group AB (“Embracer”), a Swedish gaming company that directly competes against Activision. The Vice Chair of Plaintiff’s board, Emma Ihre, served as an Embracer executive at the time that this lawsuit was filed in November 2022. As far as Mr. Kotick is aware, Plaintiff made no effort to address this clear conflict of interest, and neither did Embracer.</em></li>



<li><em>Embracer was facing extreme economic turmoil in Fall 2022, and was grasping at ways to reverse the decrease in its stock price that occurred throughout 2022. The lawsuit did just that: Embracer’s stock price spiked immediately after AP7’s complaint was released to the public on November 9, 2022—by 15% from November 9 to 11, 2022. Indeed, the increase from November 9 to 10 was the largest one-day increase in Embracer’s stock price for the entire 2022 year. This benefitted not only Embracer, but also AP7 and Ms. Ihre (who owned significant shares in Embracer).</em></li>



<li><em>Notably, this lawsuit was timed to occur just days before Embracer would be announcing disappointing financial results and the delay of its most highly anticipated game, Dead Island 2. Embracer announced these results and the delay of Dead Island 2 on November 17, 2022, which Embracer knew would exert downward. </em></li>



<li><em>[...]this Delaware lawsuit was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision, making it more difficult for Activision to recruit talent and expand through M&amp;A activity of the sort that Activision relied on to grow historically. </em></li>



<li><em>Just two days before AP7 initiated this action, on November 1, 2022, Embracer announced that it was kicking off a “new PR and Communications team” based out of Livermore, California.</em></li>



<li><em>The fact that this PR team was kicked off just two days before this suit was filed does not appear to be a coincidence—bad press for Activision would have made it easier for Embracer in its new “PR and Communications” campaign. By contrast, through its false claims in this suit, AP7 painted Activision as a company with poor corporate citizenship.</em></li>



<li><em>This collateral attack on Activision also appears to be tied to Embracer’s desire to boost sales of its games while leaving Activision hamstrung in the development of its own games that competed against Embracer’s titles. Not only were multiple Activision games delayed or cancelled after this lawsuit was brought (including Odyssey, Overwatch 2 Hero Mode, and Call of Duty Warzone Mobile), but Embracer had a number of contemporaneous releases that it knew would compete against Activision’s titles.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>According to Kotick and his lawyers, the contemporaneous releases were <strong>Dead Island 2</strong> and <strong>Call of Duty Zombies</strong>, <strong>Insurgency</strong> and <strong>Call of Duty</strong>, <strong>Remnant 2</strong> and <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, and <strong>Warlander</strong> and <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Embracer has since refuted Kotick's allegations. In a statement <a href="http://substack.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.TAzxpN3N72uz4fiy4KCyTdWBaHxkiRkE6tTsAwmhXlA?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to Game File</a>, they said:</p>



<p><em>Embracer did not and does not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision. There was no coordination or collaboration between Embracer and AP7 relating to any of Mr. Kotick's statements. No agenda or instructions were directed from Embracer via Emma Ihre or directly to AP7.</em></p>



<p>We'll keep an eye on the developments of this lawsuit, which is far from over. Stay tuned.</p>
