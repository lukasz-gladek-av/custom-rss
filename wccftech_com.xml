			<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/de-nouveaux-packs-ps5-inattendus-bientot-devoiles-avec-des-promos-a-la-cle-60148">billbil-kun on Dealabs</a>, PlayStation 5 console bundles with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> are due to be announced soon.</p>
<p>Billbil-kun doesn't list a specific release date, but speculates that they could be announced later on this month for PlayStation's upcoming Days of Play promotion. There's also no word of a PS5 Pro bundle coming, just standard and digital edition PS5s. They estimate that the standard PS5 with Black Ops 6 bundle will be $449.99 USD, while the digital edition bundle will be $399.99 USD.</p>
<p>It's not a big surprise that we're getting a PS5 console bundle with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, especially considering that there was a PS5 bundle for 2022's Modern Warfare 2 and 2023's Modern Warfare 3.</p>
<p>Even though it's more business as usual between Sony and Activision, it does have the air of being another sign as to how committed Xbox is to continuing as a third-party publisher with a software-first approach. At the prices listed by billbil-kun, these bundles are much better deals than going out and buying a brand-new Xbox Series X/S. So you won't go out and get the Xbox hardware, but these bundles will come with Xbox-owned software.</p>
<p>Xbox-owned games also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-dominate-ps5s-download-charts-for-april-2025-oblivion-remastered-already-the-uss-third-best-selling-game-of-2025/">dominated the sales charts for PlayStation games in April 2025</a>, and long-time Xbox exclusive series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War</a>, will officially be coming to PlayStation this summer. All of these things feel like events you wouldn't believe if you were hearing it from someone in 2019.</p>

			<p>The latest PC games to receive support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation are MechWarrior 5: Clans, New World: Aeternum, and Spirit of the North 2.</p>
<p>MechWarrior 5: Clans is the Unreal Engine 5-powered single-player and co-op campaign focused spin-off of MechWarrior 5. The game launched in October 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-is-in-mechwarrior-5-clans-a-quiet-place-road-ahead-and-forgive-me-father-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>; tomorrow, with the debut of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3463200/MechWarrior_5_Clans__Ghost_Bear_Flash_Storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Bear: Flash Storm story-based DLC</a>, Clans will be updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, enabling much faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. Moreover, the NVIDIA app override functionality will be updated to allow users to manually upgrade the existing NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution CNN model to the newest transformer one for improved image quality.</p>
<p>In exactly a week from today, Amazon Games will launch Season 8 - Season of the Divide for its MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>. The new Season will introduce the new Outpost Rush map Coral Divide, Capture The Flag maps, a new 3v3 Arena map, seasonal events, limited-time world events featuring iconic bosses from the dungeons, the barbershop, and several combat updates included tuned aim assist for controller users. New World: Aeternum will also now default to using DirectX 12 on Steam, and the developers have improved visuals and performance on NVIDIA GPUs thanks to the addition of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>In two days, the third-person adventure sequel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778840/Spirit_of_the_North_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spirit of the North 2</a> will let players once again wander in a mysterious world as a lonely fox. This game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation from day one.</p>
<p>There are also PC games that still adopt just the regular NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution. For example, the realistic multiplayer first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2406770/Bodycam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bodycam</a> was recently updated to support DLSS SR, and Frame Generation will be added soon. Bossa's cooperative open world survival game adventure,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-upcoming-lost-skies-officially-due-to-arrive-in-early-access-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Skies,</a> recently launched on Steam Early Access with DLSS Super Resolution integration.</p>
<p>The side-scrolling action RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a> also featured NVIDIA DLSS SR support when it launched on Steam, and the same goes for the first-person horror adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019760/Necrophosis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Necrophosis</a>. The latter game also offers a demo to check out ahead of the purchase.</p>

			<p>Among the many high games I checked out during Gamescom last year was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hordes-of-hunger-hands-on-preview-monster-survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hordes of Hunger</a>, a unique blend of mechanics lifted from Vampire Survivors, Hades, and hack-and-slash games. Though my test session was short, I was immediately captivated by the smoothness of the gameplay and the character-building possibilities the game seemed to offer right from the beginning. Though it seemed to lack a bit of polish compared to other similar games, I felt the game had a ton of potential with its relatively straightforward formula almost reminiscent of an arcade game that made it very easy to get into.</p>
<p>Following the release of a demo version that was generally very well-received, Hordes of Hunger is now available as an Early Access release on Steam. After spending a dozen or so hours with the very first public release of the game, I can only say that my expectations after trying the game for the first time last year were almost completely met.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250428121356_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The <em>"3D action survivorlike" </em>developed by Hyperstrange doesn't waste any time getting the player into the thick of the action. After starting the game, main character Mirah awakens in the Sanctum, the only safe haven for humanity after the Beast and its ravenous hordes have stripped the land bare, ready to take on these hordes and save the world. Much like in the aforementioned Hades, the story develops as Mirah completes quests set in several different locations and rescues other central characters that will also offer additional services to help the warrior overcome even more challenging enemies. These services are generally standard fare for the genre, such as purchasing permanent perks from the Father, buffing meals from the Mother, or crafting new weapons at the Workshop, and they are extremely easy to understand and take full advantage of.</p>
<p>This simplicity works quite well in the context of Hordes of Hunger, as the game wants the player to constantly be out and about to fight the hordes of the Beast, hordes whose strength changes depending on the location and how many quests have already been completed in it. For example, the Main Square will be the starting point for all players, as it features the easiest enemies, while the Watermill and the Forest feature from the very first Horde Extermination quest some advanced enemy types that require players to be at the very least familiar with the different weapon types, which range from the basic all-rounder sword to the hard hitting hammer and the mobile spear, their heavy attacks, which require Focus built by fighting enemies, special attacks and the general use of the skills learned as Mirah levels up during quests.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250428120718_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As I highlighted last year, the skill system, along with the smooth, fast-paced, satisfying gameplay, is the feature that best defines Hordes of Hunger. The first public version of the game features a nice selection of skills that range from simple stat buffs to unique abilities like auras that deal elemental damage, additional attacks with phantom weapons, dodge and parry enhancements and so on that can not only be enhanced multiple times, but that also synergize well, and unexpectedly in some cases. As Miriah levels up reasonably quickly, and can do so even faster by acquiring certain perks, it doesn't take too long for the warrior to get powered up and see all sorts of special elemental effects go off at once, which, to be honest, tends to be a little distracting and often makes it difficult to understand what is going on amidst all the chaos. This is, in my opinion, one of the biggest issues found in Hordes of Hunger in its first Early Access release, alongside the unpolished and somewhat clunky menus that don't feel designed for controllers, especially the weapon crafting interface, where it is difficult to see which element is highlighted.</p>
<p>With so many combat options at the player's disposal right from the get-go, varied quests that range from simple extermination of enemies to simple escort and target destruction quests, and the promise of bigger things to come down the line, Hordes of Hunger is a well worth purchase even in its current state for players looking for a game that is highly addictive, feels great to play and doesn't require tens of hours to get going. While the experience could become a little repetitive after a few hours, its solid direction is remarkable, and I hope developer Hyperstrange will continue to spice up the experience ahead of its 1.0 release, which has yet to be dated.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game Prices Were Going to Rise Sooner or Later Due to Production Costs and Players’ Expectations, Says Former PlayStation President; Remasters and PC ]]></title>

			<p>The price of video games started rising in 2020, but even if that didn't happen five years ago, a price increase would have happened sooner or later for a few reasons, according to former PlayStation president Shuhei Yoshida.</p>
<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida-san was asked about the increase in video game prices, which may become more normalized with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. According to the former PlayStation president, this price increase would have happened sooner or later, regardless of who would have been the initiator. Inflation is real and significant, Yoshida-san continued, and the fact that players expect ever more ambitious games with rising production costs is a combination that can only increase the price of games.</p>
<p>To keep production costs under control and continue producing the AAA games the public buys, Shuhei Yoshida added, industry actors are keen to diversify their revenues. This is the reason behind the proliferation of remasters, remakes, and PC ports, as they are an easy solution to bring in profits to finance new games. Subscription services and GAAS titles also help finance AAA games.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the former PlayStation president feels that a balance between production costs and game prices must be found. GTA 6 will obviously be a case in point, but the recent Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 has shown that it is possible to release an excellent game with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality.</p>
<p>It isn't just Nintendo that is increasing the price of its games in the near future, but also Microsoft. While the publisher did not increase game prices when the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S generation began, some of its games will be priced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">$80 starting this holiday season</a>. The price of the Xbox Series X has also been increased worldwide, with the steepest increase in the United States.</p>
