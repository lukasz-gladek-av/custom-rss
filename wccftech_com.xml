			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> was one of the bright spots in 2020, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-is-out-on-july-11-developed-by-iron-galaxy/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> on the horizon in July, fans are hoping this isn't the last remastered Tony Hawk game we'll see. Even Tony Hawk himself doesn't want this to be the end, and would like to see Activision move on to the Tony Hawk's Underground games.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/tony-hawks-underground-remake-campaign/">ScreenRant</a>, Hawk was asked about whether the Underground games had entered his conversations with Activision. He admitted that they hadn't necessarily talked about the Underground games, but Hawk did make it clear that he would like to see it happen, and that he'll be doing his best to make it happen.</p>
<p>"<em>I always have aspirations</em>," Hawk said. "<em>It's not up to me, generally. I'll campaign all I can, but I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me.</em>"</p>
<p>It seems that if it were up to Tony Hawk to make the call as to what the next remastered games would be, he'd have Activision work their way through the rest of the series, with Underground 1+2 next. But the chances of that will depend on how Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 goes.</p>
<p>And even then, it still might not happen. Even the fact that 3+4 is happening at all feels like something related to a miracle, since Activision had <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/">originally said no to a pitch from Vicarious Visions for 3+4</a>, before Vicarious Visions was sunsetted and absorbed into Blizzard.</p>
<p>If THPS 3+4 is able to repeat and improve on the success that THPS 1+2, then we can remain hopeful that an Underground 1+2 remaster will be on the way. Until then, we can look forward to the fan remake that's underway, with the first Underground game being <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-tony-hawks-underground-remake/">remade in Unreal Engine 5.</a></p>

			<div><header>Product Info</header><div>
						<h5>AceZone A-Blaze</h5><p><span>May 12th, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>AceZone is far from being a widely recognizable brand, but there's no doubt that the Danish company deserves to be as popular as other headset manufacturers, as its products geared towards eSports are of the highest quality, and are absolutely worthy of their prices. The high prices of products such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/acezone-a-spire-wireless-for-the-most-demanding/">A-Spire Wireless</a> which I had the chance to try out earlier this year is effectively the only reason why it has failed to reached a wider audience, as some of its advanced features, such as its excellent Active Noise Cancelling tech, are great to have even in everyday usage like playing single player games that may not require the incredible audio accuracy the headset offers and even in not-intended use cases, like playing guitar or drums very loudly.</p>
<p>AceZone has been well aware of how the high price of their headsets prevented them from becoming more popular among players aiming to become the top of the pack in eSports games. As such, the Danish company has created the A-Blaze, a headset coming with a good portion of the features that make their other headsets excellent, but at a more palatable price. Even with some different features, is the A-Blaze a worthy addition to the AceZone headset lineup? It most definitely is, as only the most demanding players will miss the features removed from the A-Spire to make the new headset more affordable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With the AceZone A-Blaze retailing for $199 when it will launch in the United States, €199 in Europe, where it can be purchased from the <a href="https://www.acezone.io/en-eu/products/a-blaze?srsltid=AfmBOorw9lp0mg5AhtVWNwd2IypEMNtpx_zYmEIikXJ3383Z_g4DWBkt">official website</a>, instead of the $369/€369 of the A-Spire Wireless, it's not surprising to see that the headset doesn't come with a hard carry case, but, at a glance, that seems the only significant difference with its more expensive counterpart. The A-Blaze sports the same design as the A-Spire, with an all black color scheme in place of the black and grey, which still looks great, and gives the headset a very professional look that is far removed from that of other gaming headsets that often sport vibrant designs and RGB lights. Packed together with the headset is a wireless dongle and a USB-C cable, allowing users to use the headset wirelessly and wired with ease. In both cases, the headset is instantly recognized on Windows 11, making for a proper, hassle-free plug and play experience that is very welcome, with extremely low audio latency, which is not surprising, as the A-Blaze, much like the A-Spire Wireless, features Bluetooth 5.4 powered by the newest chipset from Qualcomm. In terms of connectivity, however, the A-Blaze doesn't offer a traditional AUX connection, which could be an issue for console players who want to plug the headset into their controllers. Other than this very minor issue, using the headset on PlayStation 5 is just as simple as doing the same on PC, as it paired without any hassle with my launch model. With the same weight of 270 grams, the A-Blaze is as comfortable as the A-Spire. The built-in DSP also allows users to store their personalized settings in the headset itself, so the installation of software or using the mobile app is not required.</p>
<p>Besides a different color scheme and the lack of a traditional AUX connection, the other features removed from the A-Spire to make the AceZone A-Blaze more affordable are unlikely to be an issue for most users. The new headset has a less powerful Hybrid ANC and Noise Cancelling Microphone, which, to be honest, I wouldn't have realized if I didn't put the headset through some extreme tests. Like for the A-Spire headset, I used the A-Blaze while playing acoustic drums, and I had no trouble hearing the click and the backing track even when going all out during some intense progressive metal tunes. Same for the microphone, whose quality is just as good as that of the A-Spire microphone, even though it probably wouldn't be able to accomplish the same extreme noise cancelling as its more expensive counterpart is capable of. The A-Blaze's functionality via the mobile app is significantly reduced, as it doesn't support glasses mode, microphone equalizer, and adjustable ANC and transparency, which are features that only the most advanced audio-savvy users would be using for particular use cases. With a 45-hour battery life, compared to the 35 hours of the A-Spire, the A-Blaze at least comes up on top in this regard, and can be used for longer on a full charge, which is definitely good to have.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though it features less powerful Advanced Hybrid ANC, the AceZone A-Blaze still features the same top-notch audio quality as the A-Spire. While AceZone developed their audio technology with eSport titles in mind, with a specific audio design, allowing users to hear sounds that are almost imperceptible on other headsets with incredible accuracy, it works incredibly well with pretty much every game, especially in those experiences meant to be immersive. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, for example, I was able to hear sounds that were completely lost in the audio mix using some standard earbuds and headphones, making the experience more immersive than ever. In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the A-Blaze allowed me to listen to the game's fantastic soundtrack in the best possible way and hear some very soft guitar and keyboard passages that would have been lost otherwise. If you have even a remote interest in audio quality, there's really no better choice in gaming than the AceZone's headsets.</p>
<p>While the price point of $199/€199 may still be beyond the budget most gamers are willing to invest into a gaming headset, the A-Blaze is more than worthy purchase for all those who want to elevate their gaming experiences, no matter the type of game they usually play. As the features that have been removed from the more expensive A-Spire Wireless were geared towards the most demanding e-Sports games players, their removal shouldn't impact the target audience for the A-Blaze, ultimately making it a much more enticing purchase.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Featuring the same incredible audio quality and only slightly less powerful Advanced Hybrid ANC as the A-Spire - but at a considerably lower price - the AceZone A-Blaze is undoubtedly an excellent headset, more than worthy of its cost for those seeking the best product in its price range. Despite cutting a few features found in its more expensive counterpart—features unlikely to affect the vast majority of regular users—the headset retains a premium feel that sets it apart from nearly every other gaming headset, ditching unnecessary frills like RGB lighting in favor of features that truly matter and elevate the gaming experience.</p>

			<p>A port of Grand Theft Auto IV for current generation consoles may release this year, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1921889318588567785%7Ctwgr%5E82c5c40957329ef83365f87a424dd45beb955192%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fvideotechuk_%2Fstatus%2F1921889318588567785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@videotechuk_</a> on X, well-known Rockstar leaker Tez2 recently revealed that someone at Rockstar hinted at a port of the fourth entry in the series in the past, and by now, it should have been in development for a year. This port could be released before the end of 2025, and this is one of the reasons the Liberty City Preservation Project, which recreated the entirety of the Grand Theft Auto IV main city in GTA V, was taken down, alongside other unspecified existing reasons.</p>
<p>The fourth entry in the popular open-world series may not be the only now-classic game developed by Rockstar Games that could be released on modern systems in the future. According to Tez2, if Rockstar Games continues to follow its older plans, a modern port of Max Payne 3 could follow the Grand Theft Auto IV port, giving Take-Two the opportunity to release a bundle or Definitive Edition coinciding with the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a> in the works by Remedy Entertainment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">According to Tez, the long anticipated GTAIV port appears to be in-development for current-gen consoles per his source.</p>
<p>He believes Max Payne 3 will follow after. <a href="https://t.co/jpKrpiK1Fo">pic.twitter.com/jpKrpiK1Fo</a></p>
<p>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1921889318588567785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the past, we have heard multiple times that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-iv-remastered-2023/">Grand Theft Auto IV would return to modern consoles</a>, but neither ports nor remasters have materialized, so we have to take what Tez2 revealed with a grain of salt. Given how Grand Theft Auto VI has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">delayed to May 2026</a>, however, Rockstar Games and Take-Two now have a window of opportunity to still give fans of the series something that could tide them over until the launch of the next entry in the franchise. Hopefully, this port will receive better treatment than the disappointing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition collection.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartridge-options.1186776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Cards will likely be widely used, as the cartridge formats available to developers and publishers are rather limited.</p>
<p>As reported by Necro Felipe on X, the recent leak from Arc System Works, which included an in-development build of Guilty Gear Stride and the reveal of a new unannounced game that will launch on the next-generation Nintendo system, confirmed that only three types of game formats are available - digital game only, 64 GB cartridge, and Game-Key Card format. As the only actual cartridge option is the 64GB one, this is likely why many of the games releasing during the system's launch window are doing so in Key Card format, and why the format will likely be widespread unless Nintendo starts offering more cartridge options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="pt">[Nintendo Switch 2]</p>
<p>Graças aos vazamentos da Arc System Works, encontrados apenas três tipos de formatos são exibidos para jogos em projeto para o Switch 2:</p>
<p>• [DL] Jogo digital apenas<br>
• [64GB] Cartucho com jogo completo<br>
• [POTION] Codinome para o formato Key Card</p>
<p>— 'Necro' Felipe #UnivNintendo (@necrolipe) <a href="https://twitter.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While new in name, the concept behind the Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards is nothing new, as we have seen a lot of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S retail editions discs that don't include games, and require substantial downloads to play games, like the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-retail-requires-full-download/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>. What makes this format interesting, other than the fact that they can be lent to other players as if they were a regular cartridge, is the fact that, judging from the Arc System Works leak, Game-Key cards will allow downloading of games even in regions that don't officially support the eShop.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>
