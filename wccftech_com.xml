			<p>Getting a brand new PlayStation 5 in the United States will be cheaper than ever for the next month or so, as the console's MSRP has been officially dropped for the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad</a> shared today confirmed that the MSRP for the console's Digital Edition has been dropped to $379.99 from $449.99. The offer, which has only been confirmed for the US as of now, will be available until December 24th, so there will be plenty of time to take advantage of this deal before it ends.</p>

<p>While an MSRP drop for the console's Standard Edition would have been welcome, those who wish to play retail versions of games still have the option of purchasing the external disc drive, although they may have a hard time doing so at a reasonable price as the recently released PlayStation 5 Pro is lacking a disc drive, leaving those wishing to play retail games with no other options other than buying one. Despite this shortcoming, the mid-generation system is still a worthwhile purchase for those who wish to experience games at their best, offering considerable visual and performance improvements, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</a> More information on the console can be found in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Mark Cerny has crafted something amazing with the PlayStation 5 Pro, introducing new AI upscaling and PSSR rendering techniques that will make existing games look their best. Rather than being a new console entirely, Sony is positioning themselves as the graphics card upgrade that players have been asking for for years.</em></p>
