			<p><strong>Marathon</strong> is set to arrive on PC and PS5 on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-marathon-release-date-following-xbox-store-leak/">March 5, 2026</a>,</strong> and just ahead of its arrival, <strong>Bungie</strong> is looking to stress-test its servers with a <strong>Server Slam Test</strong> that'll run from <strong>February 26 to March 2.</strong> The test was announced with a new gameplay trailer at yesterday's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, after which game director <strong>Joe Ziegler</strong> showed off more of the game by streaming it with popular Twitch streamers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB7MPIGH2Qg">TheBurntPeanut</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd_Iqrz2SjW9uLn69Yr2uWg">Gingy</a>.</p>



<p>The new trailer was another showing of Marathon's narrative elements with a few more snippets of gameplay, before Ziegler began narrating and announcing the server slam test coming in a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Players on PS5 and PC will be able to join in the test for free without having to sign up prior to its start, and you'll get the chance to check out Marathon's survival gameplay elements, jumping into two zones, <strong>Perimeter</strong> and <strong>Dire Marsh</strong>.</p>

<p>You'll also get to try out <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/">all six core Runner shells,</a> including the seventh Rook shell for solo players, and take on the game's first five contracts, giving you a taste of what the game's earliest hours will feel like. If you participate in the server slam test and then grab the game, you'll also get a special emblem and player banner in the full release.</p>



<p>Bungie is also adding a few weapon charms inspired by other <strong>PlayStation</strong> <strong>Studios</strong> published and developed titles, which will be available to <strong>PS Plus</strong> players. The three charms are inspired by <strong>Helldivers 2, Ghost of Yotei,</strong> and <strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>.</p>

<p>Marathon will arrive on PC and PS5 on March 5, 2026. With one of the best-selling games in the industry right now <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">being an extraction shooter</a>, it'll be interesting to see if Bungie can capitalize on a renewed interest in the genre. If it can't, then with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-months-ahead-of-launch/">slew of issues the studio has had</a> in the last few years, its future will be seriously put into question.</p>

			<p><strong>Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</strong>, a brand new 2D game in <strong>KONAMI</strong>'s revered series, was announced yesterday <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the State of Play</a>. This year, the franchise celebrates its <strong>40th anniversary</strong>, and fans are thrilled not only because of the new game (the first since <strong>2014's Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</strong>) but also because KONAMI <strong>has confirmed it's just the first in a series of new projects</strong>.</p>



<p>Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is set more than two decades after the events of <strong>Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</strong> and the recent animated series on Netflix. It takes place in the streets of <strong>15th-century Paris</strong>, where a new chapter of the legendary House Belmont is about to be written in bloody red ink. Armed with the legendary holy whip "Vampire Killer", the protagonist, Trevor Belmont's successor, must descend into the French capital city <strong>under attack by monstrous creatures</strong>, making his way to a looming mystical castle to hunt down the beasts and save the Parisians from eternal darkness.</p>



<p>Long-time fans and newcomers to the franchise <strong>will have to master different weapons and spells</strong> if they hope to defeat these foes. Moreover, the developers (<strong>Evil Empire</strong> and <strong>Motion Twin</strong>) suggested that <strong>thoroughly exploring the castle will benefit daring players</strong>. New areas are rich with secrets and puzzles to uncover, as well as deadly traps that demand constant vigilance.</p>



<p>The iconic whip, a <strong>trademark of the Castlevania franchise</strong>, returns with renewed purpose and will now serve as a vital traversal tool, <strong>allowing players to swing across diverse areas to uncover hidden rooms</strong> and reach previously inaccessible areas. Mastery of the whip’s mechanics also unlocks alternative combat possibilities, enabling players to strike enemies from unconventional positions.</p>
