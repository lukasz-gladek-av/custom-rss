			<p>As promised by <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, the new <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong> feature is now publicly available via an update released for the <strong>NVIDIA app</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-soon-add-dynamic-fx-responds-to-in-game-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced earlier this month at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> for a late January release, RTX Remix Logic enables modders to <strong>dynamically trigger graphics effects in direct response to real-time in-game events</strong>. Critically, it achieves this without requiring source code or engine access, which would otherwise make it a dealbreaker in most cases.</p>



<p>NVIDIA says there are <strong>over 30 in-game events</strong> that can be triggered, such as:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Event Category</th><th data-align="left">Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Player state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Camera position, camera zoom, player world coordinates</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>World bounding boxes</strong></td><td data-align="left">Indoor/outdoor detection, region-specific triggers</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Object state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Any tracked object's position, visibility, and proximity to the player</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Time flow</strong></td><td data-align="left">In-game time of day, elapsed real-time</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Input</strong></td><td data-align="left">Specific key presses by the player</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p> These triggers can manipulate <strong>over 900 RTX Remix graphics parameters</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lighting conditions (time of day, color temperature, intensity)</li>



<li>Weather systems (rain, snow, fog density, volumetric effects)</li>



<li>Material properties (displacement, reflectivity, emissiveness)</li>



<li>Post-processing effects (chromatic aberration, bloom, vignette)</li>



<li>Path-traced volumetrics (smoke, atmospheric scattering)</li>
</ul>



<p>You won't even need to be a professional coder to add RTX Remix Logic to your mods. <strong>NVIDIA has introduced an accessible, no-code node-based interface</strong> where modders can easily drag-and-drop nodes representing triggers and actions, connect cause and effect relationships visually, fine-tune parameters with dedicated sliders and dropdowns, and finally preview all the changes they've made in real time within the Remix editor. More crafty RTX Remix modders will even be able to <strong>create and share custom event triggers</strong>, and new action nodes can be added via plugins, making the framework heavily extensible.</p>



<p>NVIDIA's demo was created in <strong>Half-Life 2 RTX</strong>, where RTX Remix Logic can trigger a '<strong>Ravenholm multiverse</strong>' whenever the player opens a specific door, as shown below. There are many RTX Remix mods in development (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we reported a new one for <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong> just yesterday</a>); it will be interesting to see which modders decide to add this new system to their mod projects. According to NVIDIA, RTX Remix Logic can be added to <strong>over 165 classic PC games</strong>.</p>

<p>Today, NVIDIA also shared a small update on new games that support its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) set of technologies. <strong>Half Sword</strong>, a physics-based medieval combat simulator scheduled to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will debut with built-in support for <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> with the option to upgrade <strong>Super Resolution</strong> to the second-generation <strong>DLSS 4.5</strong> transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong>, which is out now in advanced access (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find our review here</a>), supports DLSS Super Resolution. The same goes for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released free-to-play PvP raid shooter <strong>Highguard</strong></a>, in which GeForce RTX owners can also upgrade Super Resolution to DLSS 4.5 via the app.</p>

			<p>If you are a fan of the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series, you are well aware of how <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is <strong>struggling</strong> in more ways than one. Launched successfully in late February 2025, the game's <strong>low challenge level</strong> and <strong>performance issues</strong> prevented it from capitalizing on its launch momentum.</p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">Title Updates</a></strong> released last year <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">addressed the low challenge level</a></strong> of the experience, this wasn't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enough</strong> for many fans of the series, who <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">returned to previous entries in the series</strong> such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter World</em> to get their hunting fix.</p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>producer Yuya Tokuda pleaded with lapsed players to return</strong></a>, but it seems the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation</strong> and the <strong>performance issues that still persist</strong> are not only keeping players away, but are <strong>deterring new ones</strong> as well.</p>



<p>Earlier today, CAPCOM shared <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf"><strong>a list of its best-selling games</strong></a> for the third quarter of the current fiscal year. While <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/"><strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong></a>,</em> and the <em>Resident Evil</em> series <strong>enjoyed strong sales</strong>, the same cannot be said of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>



<p>The latest entry in the series sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">354,000 units</strong> in the third quarter, as opposed to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">453,000 units of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em> and the 431,000 units of its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sunbreak</em></a> expansion</strong>. This difference in units sold (which may have been helped by the deep discounts of the older games offered during the holiday period), and its status as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">publisher's worst-selling game in the quarter</strong>, further highlight the struggle <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is facing, and can't seem to overcome.</p>



<p><span><em>"Rise selling more than Wilds is pretty damning,"</em>&nbsp;commented <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-q3-fy2025-best-selling-games-re4-1-08m-re-village-717k-sf6-600k-re2-529k-mh-rise-453k-mh-wilds-354k.1417129/post-150569974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetERA forums member Gilo</a></strong>, a sentiment that describes well a&nbsp;<strong>baffling and unexpected situation,</strong>&nbsp;a</span>nd that reflects how the gaming community is reacting to <strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' low sales.</strong></p>



<p>At this point, besides the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">promised performance improvements</strong> (which will hopefully also address a<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/"> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">huge technical issue discovered earlier this month</strong></a>), the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Master Rank expansion</strong> and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/potato-mode-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-the-communitys-reaction-doesnt-disappoint/">datamined Nintendo Switch 2 port</a></strong> are the last chances CAPCOM has to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">turn the perception</strong> of a game which, in my opinion, even with its flaws, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>a solid entry in the series</strong></a> that maybe needed some more time in the oven to meet every fans' expectations.</p>
