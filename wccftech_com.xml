			<p>Paul Walter Hauser, an actor who you probably know from the Apple TV+ series Black Bird, has joined Zach Creggar's upcoming Resident Evil movie, according to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/paul-walter-hauser-austin-abrams-resident-evil-zach-cregger-1236546153/">Deadline</a>. Creggar co-wrote the film with John Wick writer Shay Hatten, and he'll also be directing it following his critical hit from this year, Weapons.</p>



<p>Hauser is the second actor to publicly join the project, after Wolfs actor Austin Abrams was reported to be taking part in the <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-austin-abrams-zach-cregger-1236346563/">film earlier this year.</a> The new movie is due to arrive on September 18, 2026, though at the time of this writing we don't have a strong idea as to what the plot of the film will be, or who else will be joining Hauser and Abrams in the cast.</p>



<p>What we do know about the story, according to what Creggar told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/zach-cregger-interview-resident-evil-weapons">Inverse</a> in an interview, is that is won't be a Leon Kennedy-based story. Creggar is looking to tell "<em>a different story</em>" compared to the games, but doesn't want fans to be concerned that his film won't be a Resident Evil story.</p>



<p>"<em>It is obedient to the lore of the games, it’s just a different story</em>. <em>I’m not going to tell Leon’s story, because Leon’s story is told in the games. [Fans] already have that.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Let me say this: this is not breaking the rules of the games</em>. <em>I am the biggest worshiper of the games, so I’m telling a story that is a love letter to the games and follows the rules of the games.</em>"</p>



<p>In other Resident Evil news, ahead of Creggar's film, fans of the series can look forward to Resident Evil Requiem arriving on <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">February 27, 2026</a>.</p>
