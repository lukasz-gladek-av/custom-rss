			<p>Today, in addition to announcing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-app-update-enable-full-dlss-override-options-custom-super-resolution-scaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new NVIDIA app override features</a> and the debut of an experimental version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-project-g-assist-makes-ai-useful-to-gamers-assists-in-game-tuning-performance-diagnostics-pc-customization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project G-Assist System Assistant</a>, the GeForce maker also shared several updates on new games that support its DLSS technology.</p>
<p>As we reported in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our article</a>, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is available in the Half-Life 2 RTX demo that debuted last week, alongside other NVIDIA technologies: RTX Direct Illumination, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Volumetrics, and RTX Skin.</p>
<p>Last week also saw the debut of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation in the MMOFPS Enlisted, developed by Darkflow Software and published by Gaijin. The game already supported <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaijin-talks-enlisted-rt-cores-nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-huge-step-forward-and-dx12-ultimate-support-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS Super Resolution</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaijin-on-nvidia-rtx-vulkan-enlisted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ray traced global illumination</a>, as we previously discussed in our interviews with the developers. Now, with Multi Frame Generation, owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards can benefit from up to a 4.3x frame rate boost when playing at 4K and max settings with Super Resolution set to Performance Mode.</p>

<p>Netmarble's N2 also launched the Unreal Engine 5-powered MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/rf-online-next-sci-fi-mmo-looks-gorgeous-in-new-g-star-trailers-pc-mobile-launch-set-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RF Online Next</a> in South Korea a few days ago. The game includes day-one support for DLSS Super Resolution.</p>
<p>Today, Swedish developer Fatshark has released a new update called 'Nightmares and Visions' for its game Warhammer 40K Darktide. The cooperative first-person action game already supported Super Resolution and Frame Generation, but it has now been updated (as NVIDIA had <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-driver-confirms-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-and-darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> last week) to the DLSS 4 transformer model with Multi Frame Generation support, improving both quality and performance.</p>
<p>NEXON's The First Berserker Khazan also supports DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, though you'll have to use the NVIDIA app override to get the transformer model. NVIDIA measured the performance uplift to be around 3.5x on average at 4K resolution, max settings, and Super Resolution set to Performance Mode. The game is out now for those who purchased the Deluxe Edition, though the release date is technically on Thursday, March 27. Meanwhile, read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our review</a> on why it's an excellent action game.</p>
<p>Thursday will also see the debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/karma-the-dark-world-to-launch-next-month-on-ps5-and-pc-will-support-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARMA: The Dark World</a>, an intriguing indie first-person cinematic psychological thriller. The game has built-in support for DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA Reflex, with DLSS 4 transformer model and Multi Frame Generation that can be enabled through the NVIDIA app.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, FBC: Firebreak is due this Summer with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the whole slate of path tracing features we've previously seen in Alan Wake 2.
