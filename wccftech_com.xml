			<p>To everyone's surprise, members of the Monster Hunter Wilds development team will give a talk on performance optimization later this month while the game continues to be affected by all sorts of technical issues.</p>



<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/2025/timetable/detail/s67ad32469773b/">CEDEC 2025 official website</a>, programmer Yuichi Ito and AI Engineer Takanori Nakamura will host a talk on July 24 during this year's edition of Japan's largest annual conference for game developers regarding the challenges of optimizing the latest entry in the series and how the team reportedly managed to <em>"maintain stable operation"</em> while realizing the game's core features, a statement many will inevitably find funny, at the very least, considering how the game doesn't run well on anything other than the very top end PC hardware and with upscaling and frame generation on top.</p>



<p>A few months since launch, Monster Hunter Wilds' performance is just as disappointing as it was back in February. <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/">Title Update 2</a>, which went live yesterday, introduced some VRAM utilization improvements but has not addressed the many issues the game still has on this front. The new update also introduced some stability issues that are causing crashes on a variety of system configurations, but these, at least, will be addressed soon with a new 1.020.01.00 patch announced today. The patch will also address another issue in the PC version of the game that may cause unstable performance when equipping ranged weapons.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn how the game still manages to be a great new entry in the series despite the performance issues by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Although&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>&nbsp;is not focused on combat, the new entry in the series by Kojima Productions introduces new tools and a slew of improvements that make </span>it more fun and convenient to take on all sorts of enemies, ranging from human enemies to BTs. Stealth has been likewise been improved, and the game now provides you with so many tools to clear enemy camps without getting spotted by the enemy.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't take long to notice how fighting enemies and sneaking around still feels  a little cumbersome. Sam's mobility is still quite limited, and is only partially improved by equipping a Battle Skeleton, and enemies seem to be able to spot the porter no matter how careful you are, often turning camp clearing into a head-on combat affair, which doesn't feel great for the same reason sneaking doesn't. As such, you will eventually start avoiding enemy camps completely.</p>



<p>However, there's <strong>a way to make stealth and combat way more enjoyable in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>, and it's so game-changing that it's really surprising to see how the game doesn't highlight this during what essentially is the long tutorial sequence in Mexico. This trick improves things to much that it makes the game feel more like the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain that we never got.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Before infiltrating an enemy camp, find a safe spot some distance away, <strong>hold the Triangle button to drop your entire backpack</strong>, and try moving around. You will instantly notice how agile Sam is without cargo encumbering him. The difference is really night and day: you can now sprint and slide faster, and consistently double jump after sprinting if you have a Battle Skeleton equipped. Not having cargo on your back also makes it harder for enemies to spot you, meaning that you will have a much easier time sneaking into camps and taking enemies down one by one without getting spotted.</p>



<p>One may argue that dropping the backpack will leave you with a limited number of items that you can use, as only those Sam is carrying in his suit will be available, but this is hardly a problem. The contrary. If you have infiltrated an enemy camp already, you will have noticed how many resources, tools and weapons can be found scattered around, and you can just pick them up on the spot and use during your current infiltration. In many ways, this mirrors the premise of the Metal Gear Solid games where Snake has to procure almost everything he needs to complete his mission on site.</p>



<p>While leaving your backpack behind doesn't help a lot against BTs, as they rely on sound to spot Sam and taking them on directly doesn't reward you in any significant way, leaving your cargo behind helps a lot during boss battles. The increased mobility makes it easier to dodge enemy attacks, and Sam's evasive maneuver, which can be used while aiming, becomes way more useful. As such, always drop your backpack before fighting most enemies, and you will have a much better appreciation of the mechanics of <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, and a much better time overall.</p>

			<p>It seems like Red Dead Online is suddenly getting some new content, and it's also zombie-themed. The update set to go live later today at 5 AM Eastern Time will <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1logs5w/monthly_discounts_and_bonuses_july_1st_to_august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">include</a> the so-called Strange Tales of the West, a set of four new Telegram missions where players will aid author Theodore Levin in investigating the unknown. They'll be able to track down undead plagues, rogue automations, swamp beasts, and more by collecting Mr. Levin’s letter from any Post Office or their Camp’s Lockbox, or simply by launching Telegram Missions from the Player Menu.</p>

<p>Red Dead Online never really took off as much as GTA Online did. Arguably, the much slower pace worked well for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single player masterpiece that is Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, but not nearly as well in online multiplayer. It's been three years since Rockstar openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-online-support-seemingly-slowing-down-to-focus-on-gta-vi-and-gta-online/">acknowledged</a> that they would focus more on making content for the much more successful GTA Online, and it's been a while since RDO got anything new, which is why its fans are now positively surprised. Plus, the zombie theme certainly appears to be a nod to Undead Nightmare, the acclaimed expansion released for the first Red Dead Redemption game.</p>
