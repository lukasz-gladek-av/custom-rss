			<p>A couple of insightful Nintendo Switch 2 videos were shared online, comparing the new system's specs with those of its predecessor and other current generation systems and more.</p>
<p>The new videos, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FrameRated">FrameRated</a>, are a great way to learn more about the system's specs, how they compare with those of the other current-generation systems and its predecessor, how a comparable PC GPU, the RTX 2050 mobile, handles multiplatform games, what developers will be able to achieve with the system, and more.</p>

<p>A second video released a few days earlier also discusses the Nintendo Switch 2 ARM Cortex A78C CPU, whether it may be able to handle future tech, and how memory bandwidth could be a concern in certain cases. You can check out this second video below.</p>

<p>While it is not yet known when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide, some people online <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-out-priced-350/">claim</a> to have already obtained a unit, such as a Chinese user who obtained a CAD model of the system. If this user's claims are true, then we may be getting more information on the console sooner than early April, when Nintendo will properly unveil the new system in a dedicated Direct.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be released later this year worldwide. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remasters of the first three entries in the God of War series will be revealed soon, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>According to Reddit user<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1im4gtf/comment/mc0td3a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Feeling-Examination6</a>, the three games will be announced during this week's yet-to-be-confirmed State of Play and will be released as part of a collection of some sort later this year. If these remasters are real and coming, it will be very interesting to see how much they will be improved over the already available PlayStation 3 remasters of the first two entries in the series and the remaster of the third released on PlayStation 4 ahead of the release of 2018's God of War.</p>
<p>While we have to take the news about these God of War remasters with a grain of salt, there's some reason to believe the information shared by Reddit user Feeling-Examination6. Just yesterday, the user revealed the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/s/17kFt49uUj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hell is Us release date</a> before it was confirmed earlier than intended on the Xbox Store. The user also revealed that Ninja Gaiden would be coming back this year, although this could have been a lucky guess, considering the user talked about a reboot, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is not.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the popular series is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, which is now available on PC and PlayStation consoles. The game was going to be followed by a live service game in development by Bluepoint Games, which was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">canceled</a> along with Bend Studio's next project.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> of the official Baldur's Gate 3 modding tools by Larian back in September 2024, the modding community has begun creating full-fledged custom campaigns for the award-winning cRPG. One of the first to get a playable version is '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14914/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Grand Theater - Sell your Lute to the Devil'</a> by Moezilla. Here's the overview provided by the modder:</p>
<p><em>This is a custom modded campaign set nestled on the outskirts of Baldur's Gate, hidden from the prying eyes of the city, stands an imposing, yet strangely inviting structure: The Grand Theater. The flickering lights of lanterns and the alluring sound of music draw in travelers from far and wide, promising an experience of unparalleled entertainment. However, what lies beneath the polished veneer of extravagant performances and mesmerizing illusions is a darker, more sinister story.</em></p>
<p><em>The theater is owned and operated by a powerful faction known as the Red Wizards of Thay—arcane masters and manipulative schemers whose true intentions are often cloaked in secrecy. As they push their hidden agendas, they have crafted a show unlike any other: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for performers to showcase their talents... but at a cost.</em></p>
<p><em>In the halls of the Grand Theater, you’ll find that the show must go on—but the question remains: who will be the star of the final act, and what will they lose to secure their place under the spotlight?</em></p>
<p><em>This is a world where the Red Wizards hold the strings, and you’ll have to decide whether the cost of fame is worth the price of your soul. Will you play your part, or will the Devil demand his due?</em></p>
<p>The modder warns users that they should have finished the base Baldur's Gate 3 campaign first. This is because Larian has reportedly made it so that if you never encountered some NPCs in the default game, they won't appear in modded campaigns, either.</p>
<p>Additionally, version 1.0 is very limited in its feature set. Players will find around two thousand new lines of dialogue (text-only, no voice acting or lip sync), with six quests that can be started but only one that can be currently completed. There's also no combat yet, though the modder plans to add it to version 1.1.</p>
<p><iframe title="Baldur's Gate 3 Mods: This New DND Custom Campaign Just Dropped! | The Grand Theatre" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mZB_PwAh2s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of the most exciting Baldur's Gate 3 custom campaigns to look forward to include Path to Menzoberranzan by Lotrich (who just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oBlmSvi1So" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a video showing off the mod's progress) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forsaken</a>, which is set in the world of Warcraft, more specifically in the Undead starting zone of Tirisfal Glades. Forsaken is also currently very early, with only the starting area available.</p>

			<p>Following the new gameplay footage <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-looks-promising-in-new-gameplay-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared last month</a>, Leenzee Games has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53KnH8qJDXI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a developer diary for its upcoming game Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.</p>
<p>Producer Xia Siyuan introduced a new video that delves into the game's lore. Afterward, he talked about game mechanics and even some technical details. For example, we received confirmation that the game is now running on Unreal Engine 5:</p>
<p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has been upgraded from Unreal Engine 4 to UE5. This brings significant improvements in visual and technical performance. Realistic lighting, scanned models, and physics-based effects, along with a more robust game framework, create a more immersive game experience. This upgrade also allows us to better showcase the cultural essence we aimed to convey.</em></p>
<p>On the combat system, Siyuan said:</p>
<p><em>Skyborn Might represents the power of the Feathered clan, the ability to control over karma. As the core of the game's combat system, Skyborn Might seamlessly blends combo mechanics with RPG builds. The game features five weapon types, with 25 unique weapons spread across these categories. Each weapon offers distinct combat style and combo techniques. Players can equip both a main weapon and a secondary one. Switching weapons and quickly unleashing weapon skills further extend the combo chains.</em></p>
<p><em>The game features 40 different spells, which can be assigned to four spell slots. Players can integrate spells into their weapon combos or choose to forgo weapon combos entirely and create their own spell-focused combat style. We encourage players to build their own unique playstyles. At the Shrine, players can freely try out different weapon skills, discipline skills, and spell combinations without any cost.</em></p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is undoubtedly one of the most promising action RPG games of 2025. Published by 505 Games, it will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It has also been confirmed that the game will be added to the Game Pass subscription service from its launch day.</p>

			<p>TiMi Studio's Team Jade has announced the release date for Delta Force Black Hawk Down. The first-person shooter game's campaign mode will be available on PC starting on February 21 at 02:00 UTC+0.</p>
<p>The Black Hawk Down mode will be added to Delta Force, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-gets-pc-open-beta-test-on-december-5-console-due-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in early December as a free to play Open Beta. So far, though, the game hasn't exactly thrived. On Steam, the average score for recent user reviews is at a meager 63%, while the average score for overall user reviews is at 68%. We'll know soon if this new mode, which will be playable solo or in co-op, can turn it around for Team Jade.</p>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force | Official Black Hawk Down Teaser - Launch on February 21" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXnHhjWNxds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

This isn't a shooting gallery - it's war. Every turn could be your last, and survival is never guaranteed.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>A FAITHFUL REBOOT</strong> - The BLACK HAWK DOWN co-op campaign is a faithful reboot of the classic 2001 film and a heartfelt love letter to fans of the original 2003 Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, breathing new life into those legendary stories and moments.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>PLAY AS A TEAM</strong> - Only the best squads survive. Choose your class, customize your loadout, and, most importantly, move as a unit to overcome the unprecedented challenges ahead.</em></li>
