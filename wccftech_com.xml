			<p>Today, Funcom has shared a new Dune: Awakening trailer entirely focused on the game's extensive base-building feature, which improves upon the systems seen in Conan Exiles. Here's the transcribed overview provided by the narrating voice:</p>
<p><em>On Arrakis, exposure to the raw, unbridled elements is death. But walls alone will not save you from the maelstrom. You need power and the engineering of CHOAM to raise a protective shield against the storm. Without such protection, even the strongest walls will erode and fail in time, as will anything left in the open. Your exposed vehicle is beyond repair, but a lesson is learned.</em></p>
<p><em>You need better protection against the dangers of Arrakis. It's time to upgrade your base. Base construction and expansion can be done alone or together with others. With Celo projections, building as a group is easy. To further customize your base, you must align yourself with one of the warring Great Houses. Displaying your allegiance through their unique architecture, the Atreides welcome your aid. Swear your fealty to the Atreides and rise to greatness on Arrakis.</em></p>
<p><em>Your base serves as a reflection of both your influence and your allegiance to a faction. The safety provided by your base allows you to craft powerful new tools, technologies, and vehicles. Here we are crafting a ground car. Once each part of your vehicle is assembled, you can install modules to enhance its specialization further and customize its appearance.&nbsp; By aligning with the Atreides, you have earned the option to craft their faction-specific ground car. </em></p>
<p><em>On the horizon, another sandstorm approaches, but this time you are prepared. Your base is equipped with powerful shields for protection and a custom-built garage that will keep all your vehicles safe from the raging storm. The shields are vital, but they come with a cost. With a construction of this size, the Emperor demands taxes to keep your base running.</em></p>
<p><em>You will construct grand bases. And in Dune: Awakening, you will have the option to share them with others if you choose. All your creations can be recorded as blueprints. These can be shared with allies or even bought and sold on the Exchange. Anyone holding a blueprint can instantly</em><br>
<em>place a projection of the entire building and construct an exact copy for themselves. Dune: Awakening's building system allows for limitless creativity.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The trailer also shows off some truly impressive bases. In the press beta test, there wasn't anywhere near enough time to build something so grand, but I still got a glimpse at the very solid building system. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing several hours of the game</a>, my doubts certainly lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn more about Dune: Awakening's crafting, building, and other features, Funcom held a more than two-hour-long developer live stream yesterday. The YouTube recording can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k0389iSNIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening launches on June 10 for PC after <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a slight delay</a>. A large-scale beta test will take place between May 9 and May 12, during which many players will be able to test it out before the release.</p>

<p>Today, NVIDIA also provided an update on the latest games that will adopt its DLSS upscaling technology. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in my hands-on, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is already implemented in the ARC Raiders Tech Test that begins today for the public. Of course, GeForce RTX 40 users can enable Frame Generation, and GeForce RTX 20/30 users can activate Super Resolution.</p>
<p>The recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> supports NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA, while also taking advantage of the ray tracing cores available in the RTX architecture if the user enables hardware-accelerated Lumen ray traced global illumination.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DLSS-251-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>The roguelite first-person shooter game Deadzone: Rogue <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3228590/Deadzone_Rogue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in early access this week with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA. Just like Oblivion Remastered, it also takes advantage of the RT Cores when enabling Lumen-based hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</p>
<p>The Wuxia open world action/adventure roleplaying game Where Winds Meet was also updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on top of Frame Generation and Super Resolution. According to NVIDIA, performance can be accelerated by 3.9X at 4K resolution and max settings. The GeForce RTX 5090 can run the game at over 500 frames per second. As a reminder, a new Closed Beta Test <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-new-cbt-set-for-may-16-19-on-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is coming in a couple of weeks</a>.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 is setting out to be one of the most impressive ports launching together with the system, as the game's latest footage highlights how a more recent build of this version of the open-world RPG by CD Projekt Red has already been improved over the one used to capture the reveal trailer.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared on YouTube, SuperMetalDave64 goes over the new footage released as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FeYJHMW9xY">Nintendo's Creator's Voice series</a>, taking a good look at the game's visuals and performance. The most noticeable improvement is regarding textures, as the sequence where V is talking with Johnny Silverhand inside a restaurant, for example, features more detailed textures than in the same sequence shown in the reveal trailer. Additionally, the graphics settings seen in the new footage, a mix of mid and high PC settings, which is incredibly impressive, given the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, and the stable performance in Dogtown, the demanding central location of the Phantom Liberty expansion which wasn't released on previous generation systems, highlight how the new Nintendo console is definitely capable of surpassing PlayStation 4 graphics and performance level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2077 Graphics Upgrade Confirmed in New Gameplay Trailer In-Depth Analysis" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLYOReVmzXc?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeing Cyberpunk 2077 run on Nintendo Switch 2 in the way it currently does is extremely impressive, so it will be really interesting to see how the game will look at launch. Helping CD Projekt Red achieve this level of visual quality at solid performance is likely the use of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, which the game will employ in all of its display modes, both docked and handheld.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 complete with the Phantom Liberty expansion on June 5th, the same day the system launches worldwide, with some exceptions like China, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America, and the Caribbean.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Multiplayer Maps Discovered in the Game’s Files]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-multiplayer-maps-discovered-in-the-game%E2%80%99s-files.1177368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows may get expanded in the future with a multiplayer mode, judging from some recent discoveries.</p>
<p>As reported on X by game modder Sliderv2, the game's current version features, inside its Bootstrap file, a mention of a few developer test maps for multiplayer and PVP. This not only gives more credibility to some earlier rumors that suggested the new entry in the series would feature multiplayer in some form, but also suggests that it could still be coming at some point in the future, especially considering the game has yet to receive any major new feature as some of its predecessors did after launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Rumors of a planned multiplayer mode for Assassin's Creed Shadows may be true. The Boostrap file mentions a few developer test maps for Multiplayer and PVP. <a href="https://t.co/GJYqn99pNT">pic.twitter.com/GJYqn99pNT</a></p>
<p>— Sliderv2 (@Totocko97) <a href="https://twitter.com/Totocko97/status/1917365143895433361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Regarding content, however, Assassin's Creed Shadows is not lacking, as the game is full of side activities to complete as Naoe and Yasuke further their war against the Shinbakufu. While the game is not on par with the best open-world RPG available on the market, it is a solid and enjoyable game, and one of the best entries in the series, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>
