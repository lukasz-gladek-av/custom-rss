			<p>While the word hunt immediately brings death to your target in mind, hunts in Monster Hunter Wilds don't always have to end with the actual demise of your target monsters. On the contrary, there are some good reasons not to kill any of the giant monsters you will meet on your journey in the Forbidden Lands.</p>
<p>Capturing monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds is quite simple, but you will need a few items, which must be used at the right time. These items are <strong>Pitfall or Shock Traps</strong>, and items that can put the monster to sleep once they have fallen into one of the traps, like <strong>Tranq Bombs</strong>, <strong>Tranq Blades</strong>, which can be used as Slinger ammo or <strong>Tranq Ammo</strong>, which is only used with the Bowguns.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250303125731_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The right time to use the items above to capture a monster in Monster Hunter Wilds is when it has been <strong>weakened enough</strong>. You will know a monster is weak enough to be captured when <strong>it starts limping, if its heartbeat is going flat, or if you see a small skull icon on top of the monster's icon on the minimap</strong>. Once you have assured the monster is weak enough, place <strong>one of the two traps on the ground</strong>, wait for the monster to get <strong>caught in it</strong>, and <strong>use any of the Tranq items twice</strong>. Once this is done correctly, the monster will be captured, and your current hunt will be completed successfully, even without having actually taken the monster down.</p>
<p>While capturing monsters is a good way to end hunts slightly faster in Monster Hunter Wilds, there's another good reason to do so if you're farming certain items, as ending hunts by capturing monsters<strong> increases the rarity of quest rewards</strong>. At the same time, some monster parts can only be obtained by killing the monster, so depending on the items you are seeking, you should always consider both options to complete hunts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of new Monster Hunter Wilds mods that were released online in the past few hours address one of the game's biggest issues: its low challenge level.</p>
<p>The first one of these mods is the self-explanatory <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/136?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hard(er) Mode mod</a>, which comes in multiple variants that increase either the damage dealt by a Monster or their HP or both at the same time. This mod should also be safe to use for online play, although it is advisable not to use it to play with random players as they may not appreciate the increased difficulty over the vanilla game. As for which combination of damage and HP increase is the best, it really depends on the player. I have completed a few hunts with the 1.6x HP and 1.6 ATK option, and I have found it balanced enough with tier 7 Artian weapons and some late High Rank gear and Decorations, which are far from being the absolute best the game currently has to offer.</p>
<p>The second Monster Hunter Wilds mod that attempts to rebalance the game to offer a more challenging experience is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/171?tab=files">Reasonable Palico Nerfs mod</a>, which comes in two variants. The first reduces the efficacy and frequency of healing to 40% and 1/3, respectively, while the unreasonable variant nerfs healing further while also significantly reducing the frequency of tool usage.</p>
<p>Besides the low challenge level, Monster Hunter Wilds also suffers from significant performance issues, which have yet to be properly fixed. As highlighted by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">tech analysis</a> shared last week, the issues found in the PC version may be caused by how data streaming to the GPU is handled.</p>
<p>While the game not being challenging enough is completely subjective, Monster Hunter Wilds' performance is a real issue that does impact the experience, which is a shame, as the game is tons of fun. You can learn more about what makes it a really fun experience in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>

			<p>An unofficial PC port of Sonic Unleashed is now available for download, allowing PC users to experience the PS3/Xbox 360 era entry in the series natively with some visual improvements and additional features not available in the original releases.</p>
<p>The Unleashed Recompiled port, which can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and requires a copy of the Xbox 360 version of the game, has been created through the process of static recompilation and features no original assets whatsoever, which should make it safe from any takedown from SEGA. While the visuals have been recreated from scratch, the development team took extra care to make them as accurate as possible while also improving them where needed with up to 4K resolution support, MSAA levels over double, enhanced motion blur, and more. In addition, the port also supports unlocked framerates, although any framerate above 60 FPS could lead to issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unleashed Recompiled - Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJreGbVPDx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Unleashed is one of the very few entries in the series worth playing that are not officially available on PC, so the release of this unofficial port is quite welcome. The game's most defining feature, which was not implemented in any subsequent entry in the series, is the Werehog gameplay segments, which featured slower gameplay compared to the day stages that sported modern Sonic gameplay and focused on combat sequences.</p>
<p>The latest 3D entry in the series is<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/"> Sonic Frontiers</a>, which was released in 2022 on PC and consoles. The game was followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/">Sonic x Shadows Generations remaster</a>, which introduced new solid content to what was already a pretty solid Sonic game and one of the best in recent times.</p>

			<p>The Relic: First Guardian, an upcoming Soulslike action RPG, received a new gameplay trailer on Friday. Developed by South Korean studio Project Cloud Games and published by Perp Games, the title is due to launch later this year on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827820/The_Relic_First_Guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, on PlayStation 5, and on Xbox Series S|X. It was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/its-soulslike-galore-at-gamescom-2021-with-project-relic-soulstice-and-dolmen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> as Project Relic at Gamescom 2021. However, back then, it was unveiled as a multiplayer title. It appears that has since changed, as it's now listed as a single player game.</p>
<p>Players will embark on a heroic adventure as the last Guardian to save the world from darkness. The once-prosperous Arsiltus has been swallowed up by the void created by the destruction of the great relic and turned into a land of death. The hero's goal is to gather the pieces of the shattered Great Relic and close the Void.</p>
<p>The developers have described The Relic: First Guardian as a semi-open world action RPG where players will explore an apocalyptic fantasy world and enjoy a variety of action-packed experiences. They'll get to pick between five different types of weapon options, and each weapon has its own unique abilities that can be changed to suit their play style.</p>

<p>There won't be a traditional roleplaying game inspired leveling system. The developers have instead based the game's character progression entirely on runes, items, and crafting. These rewards will be obtained by completing dungeons and defeating bosses.</p>
