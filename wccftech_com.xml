			<p>Despite being released over 10 years ago, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt remains incredibly popular, thanks to its compelling story, engaging characters, immersive world, and engaging gameplay. Following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-next-gen-looks-amazing-on-pc-when-it-works/"><strong>Next-Gen update</strong></a> which brought the game to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S while adding new features and ray-tracing support on PC, updates and new content have become progressively more sparse, but something new could be breweing that might bring back players back to the Continent next year.</p>



<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk"><strong>Strefa Inwestorów</strong></a>, Mateusz Chrzanowski, an analyst at Noble Securities, predicts that a big DLC expansion expected to cost $30 will drop for The Witcher 3 in May 2026 (the game's 11th anniversary), and will kickstart the marketing cycle for The Witcher IV, the next entry in the series, which the firm expects to release in late 2027.</p>



<p>If this is indeed the case, there's a chance that the rumored new DLC expansion will bridge the gap between the two games, possibly providing more details on how Ciri began her new journey as a Witcher.</p>



<p>Although the idea of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt receiving a new major DLC expansion over 10 years since its original release may sound unlikely to most, this isn't the first time we have heard rumors about it. This June, well-known Polish game industry commentator Borys Nieśpielak revealed that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-dlc-2026-the-last-wish-project/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">an additional story DLC for the game is supposedly in the works by Fool's Theory</strong></a>, the studio comprised of series veterans that is working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-full-open-world/"><strong>the remake of the first entry in the series</strong></a>. Reportedly, this is one of the new projects yet to be announced by CDPR.</p>



<p>As a massive fan of the world created by Andrzej Sapkowski, I would be delighted to return to the continent for one more adventure together with Geralt before he finally passes the torch to Ciri. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-netflix-live-action-series-announced-by-ubisoft/">All the way back in 2020</a>, Netflix and Ubisoft announced that they were working on a live-action adaptation of Ubisoft's marquee franchise, Assassin's Creed. For nearly five years after that announcement, the show seemingly didn't make any progress. Though <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">after getting the green light this past July</a>, the show has already begun to find members of its cast, and now, a director.</p>



<p>A report from November <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-series-casts-toby-wallace-as-co-lead/">confirmed that Toby Wallace would star as one of the co-lead characters in the adaptation</a>, and now a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/">Variety</a> adds that Johan Renck, the Emmy-winning director best known for his work on Chernobyl, the series created by HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin, has been tapped to direct Assassin's Creed for Netflix.</p>



<p>The report also adds that, beyond Wallace, Lola Petticrew, Zachary Hart, and Laura Marcus have all joined the cast as regulars for the series, though we don't yet know who any of the actors will be playing as details of the adaptation's plot are being kept quiet for now.</p>



<p>We do know that the series will begin filming in Italy in 2026, and that Italy is also reportedly the geographical setting for the series. The show's logline says the story will be "<em>centred on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny</em>."</p>



<p>If you know anything about Assassin's Creed, then you know that the logline does nothing more than outline the basic facts of the game's stories since the first game was released back in 2007. So it seems like we'll be waiting for a while longer before actually learning what era and elements of the Assassin's Creed story the show will lean on.</p>



<p>The series is being led by showrunners Roberto Patino and David Weiner, with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, and Genevieve Jones from Ubisoft's film and television department serving as executive producers. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Shareholders Have Officially Approved the $55Bn Sale to Saudi Arabia PIF, Silver Lake]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The process of EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">going private and selling to a 'Consortium' of investors, which includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Jared Kushner's Silver Lake</a>, has just crossed its first hurdle. As initially reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mamalgryks2m">Stephen Totilo at Game File</a>, EA's shareholders have voted to approve the sale of EA to the Consortium.</p>



<p>Now, the privatization sale has to be approved by government regulators, a process which, if <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-aims-to-close-activision-blizzard-acquisition-next-friday/">Microsoft's journey to acquiring Activision Blizzard King is any indication</a>, will take longer than a few months, considering that EA announced the sale back in September and shareholders have already approved it before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Particularly because after one major video game industry acquisition made government regulators around the world pay more attention to the industry, we could see EA's deal face more scrutiny from global regulators. There have <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">already been voices of concern from US senators</a> in letters to the Secretary of the Treasury over the deal, alleging that the sale could allow for "<em>the Saudi government’s ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company</em>," the letter reads.</p>



<p>It's not just within the US that voices of concern over the deal are being raised. <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/12/cwa-canada-urges-competition-bureau-to-scrutinize-55-billion-electronic-arts-buyout/">CWA Canada is also asking Canada's competition regulators to scrutinize the deal closely</a>, with concerns shared for the Canadian developers EA employs at its Canadian-based studios, including Motive, EA Vancouver, and BioWare.</p>



<p>While the US senators' letter to the Secretary of the Treasury voiced concerns over foreign influence, CWA Canada's letter to the Canadian Competition Bureau shared more concerns about the job losses and layoffs that could result from the sale. </p>



<p>"<em>Relatedly, the transaction could lead to reductions in jobs in Canadian labor markets. EA has said publicly that the deal would not lead to “immediate” layoffs, but with the deal being financed with US$20 billion in debt, some analysts suggest layoffs are one of the key ways the company will seek to cut costs in order to service its massive debt. Layoffs could further consolidate and concentrate existing labor markets for video game workers in Canada. Our concerns are compounded by the company’s history of recent layoffs: EA has laid off over 1,700 workers since 2023</em>."</p>



<p>We're still a long way off from this deal going through; like the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard King deal, we'll likely be hearing about it for well over a year before it is finalized, if it does indeed end up happening.</p>



<p>If it doesn't go through, then we'll likely return to a status quo in the video game industry. If it does, then the Saudi Arabia PIF will own 93.4% of EA, with the other Consortium investors vying for the remaining 6.6%. </p>
