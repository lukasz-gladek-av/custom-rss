			<p>Borderlands 4 is out in the wild, and while it's enjoyed some <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">commercial</a> success right at launch, its launch has also been a bit of a mess with technical issues galore. That's unfortunately not uncommon for major triple-A releases, but what hasn't been improving the situation is how Gearbox boss, Randy Pitchford, has been responding to it.</p>



<p>Pitchford has a history of making comments online to players that don't always go over so well, and we don't have to turn the clock back too far to remember the last time his comments caused a stir with Borderlands 4. Last time, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">about the game's price</a>. This time, he's telling <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">"<em>4K stubborn</em>"</a> players that it's actually their fault that the game his studio released isn't running very well.</p>



<p>Most studios, when they launch a big game that has technical issues, put their heads down and get on with fixing it, and that's what Gearbox is doing, but most studios also don't have to deal with their boss going online and making players even more upset about the whole situation. It's not what anyone on the Gearbox team had in mind for launch, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-feels-bad-for-borderlands-4-devs-who-are-just-trying-really-hard-to-make-players-happy-as-randy-pitchford-fights-back-against-performance-criticism/">Gamesradar</a>, it has Baldur's Gate 3's publishing director, Michael Douse, feeling bad for the rest of the team trying to get the game fixed, and ensure that players have the best experience possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Just lock Randy in a cupboard for 6 months,</em>" Douse commented on X (formerly Twitter). When some responded that Pitchford is better off not being cut off, and that they prefer his honesty over an corporate-approved message, Douse agreed, but clarified, "<em>I feel bad for his teams who are just trying really hard to make players happy</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the one hand, Pitchford's brand of unmitigated honesty stands out because it's not what you hear from almost anyone else in the industry. Game development is hard, and Pitchford telling players to do it themselves if they think it's so easy isn't exactly an unfair response. Even the biggest studio with the biggest team is going to miss major and minor technical problems. It's not easy work, and players are often too quick to forget that.</p>



<p>But it's not like Borderlands 4 just has a few frame rate problems, and players are spending their hard-earned money on a game that should at least run without crashing. It's getting fixed, and that's great, but that doesn't take the sting away from knowing you've spent money on something broken. Though, as Pitchford has told players who have an issue with it, they can "<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510"><em>Please get a refund from Steam</em>"</a> if they want.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update-adds-new-dualsense-pairing-option-power-saver-mode.1299312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> system software update is set to go live in a few hours, introducing features that beta testers have been able to try out for a few months.</p>



<p>As confirmed today, the next big system software update will roll out tomorrow, September 17. Once the update is live, the system will download it automatically. If not, the download and installation process can be started manually by going into the Settings menu, then picking System, System Software, System Software Update, and Settings.</p>



<p>The biggest additions of the upcoming new PlayStation 5 system software update are Power Saver mode and a new DualSense pairing option that allows users to pair the controller with multiple devices. Power Saver mode, which can be enabled via the Settings, System, Power Saving, and Use Power Saver menu options, will be further supported down the line with updates to already available games such as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Demon's Souls, while the soon-to-be-released Ghost of Yotei will support it at launch. This rather interesting reveal seems to support the idea that this new <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver profile is targeting the specifications of the rumored PlayStation handheld system</a> that is supposedly releasing alongside the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>While Power Saver mode is an option that few are likely to use for the time being, the new PlayStation 5 system software update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-beta-program-ps5-pro-dualsense-pairing-update/">DualSense pairing option</a> is surely going to see wider usage, especially for those who use the controller on PC. Once the update is live, it will be possible to register up to four devices simultaneously and switch between them directly from the controller.</p>



<p>More information on the next PlayStation 5 system software update rolling out tomorrow can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">Official PlayStation Blog.</a></p>

			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/16/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the second half of September 2025, and following up from the first half, it's even more strong indie titles with Hades and Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor among the over a dozen games being added, starting today.</p>



<p>Hades re-enters the subscription service just ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-launches-on-pc-and-nintendo-switch-this-month/">Hades II launching into 1.0 on September 25</a>, giving players a chance to dive back into the first game before the first sequel that developer Supergiant has ever made hits its full release.</p>



<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the Deep Rock Galactic spin-off auto-shooter from Funday Games that's published by Ghost Ship's publishing arm. Like Hades II, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-releases-out-of-early-access-in-september/">Survivor is launching out of early access</a> this month, and it'll be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>



<p>Other notable titles coming for the rest of the month include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Frostpunk 2, Visions of Mana, and Sworn. There's also a game preview for Endless Legends II that'll be available on PC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the rest of the month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Roadcraft - September 16 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>For the King II - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Overthrown (Game Preview) - September 17 - Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor - September 17 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Frostpunk 2 - September 18 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Wobbly Life - September 18 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Hades - September 19 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2 (Game Preview) - September 22 - PC</li>



<li>Sworn - September 23 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Peppa Pig: World Adventures - September 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Visions of Mana - September 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light - September 30 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>
</ul>



<p>And, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This time, it's a swell of Ninja Gaiden titles, with Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge all leaving the service, alongside Terra Invicta. They'll all be gone as of September 30, 2025.</p>
