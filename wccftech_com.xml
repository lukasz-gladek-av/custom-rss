			<p>Wreckreation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">the open-world sandbox</a> driving game <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">that lets you edit the world as you go</a>, which was developed by Three Fields Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">a studio made up of former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the Burnout series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past October</a>. Now, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry has announced that the entire staff at Three Fields Entertainment has been told they could potentially lose their jobs.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's launch has been marred by technical issues, though Sperry doesn't directly cite a lacklustre launch for the game as a reason for putting the entire staff at risk of redundancy. </p>



<p>"<em>Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career. After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy</em>," Sperry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-activity-7402348277788057600-slcG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">began in her post on LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard — with heart and dedication — to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future. We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful.</em>"</p>



<p>Sperry's post also includes a video featuring post-launch content the studio is adding to Wreckreation in the hopes that it will bolster the game's audience while the team also works to correct the technical problems players faced at launch.</p>



<p>"<em>My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," </em>Sperry continued<em>. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team. I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it."<p>"To everyone who has supported us, played our games, or believed in our studio: thank you. Your support has meant the world -&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, again at our own cost, ensure the&nbsp;next update that includes a Crossplay feature does get published before Christmas and we hope you and your friends can enjoy the world that we have built together, whichever platform you play on.</p></em>"</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the second major release from Three Fields Entertainment to miss its mark. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dangerous-driving-high-speed/">Dangerous Driving in 2019 earned a 5/10 from Wccftech</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dangerous-driving/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4">stands at a 62 on Metacritic</a>. At the time, Wccftech's Nathan Birch wrote, "<em>Dangerous Driving is, at best, a rough early prototype of a proper Burnout successor. The basic mechanics and sense of speed are there, but they’re badly undermined by bland track design, infuriating AI, a lack of features, and a host of other issues. Those feeling nostalgic for Burnout would be best served taking the classics out for another spin, rather than taking a chance on this lemon.</em>"</p>
