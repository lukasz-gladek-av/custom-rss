			<p>Spellcasters Chronicles is the latest debut multiplayer game from a studio that is known for its single-player games, with Quantic Dream stepping up to try its hand in the genre. Ahead of the game's first closed beta, which will take place from December 4-7, I got the chance to play the game and ask game director Gregorie Diaconu a few questions about the coming title.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/spellcasters-chronicles-hands-on-preview-quantic-dream/">check out my hands-on preview with the game here</a> if you want to see how I got on with the time I had checking it out. In short, I'm not exactly convinced that Quantic Dream will be the first single-player-turned-multiplayer-studio that'll make both sides work. But there's still plenty of time for Quantic Dream to prove me wrong.</p>



<p>And, considering Diaconu's answers, the studio is ready to prove itself to me and to every other player currently looking at Spellcasters Chronicles with a doubtful eye.</p>

<p><strong>What was the driving force behind making a multiplayer game? What drew Quantic Dream towards this kind of project?</strong></p>



<p><em>Spellcasters Chronicles was born very organically inside the studio. Right after wrapping Detroit: Become Human, a small team started experimenting with a prototype that mixed action, strategy, and summoning, starting for the universal fantasy of being a powerful sorcerer who can summon armies of creatures of all shapes and sizes, and the simple joy of being able to fly without any limitation. It was fresh, energetic, and unlike anything we had done before, yet it still carried the things that define us: strong identity, systemic depth, and a desire to let players express themselves. </em></p>



<p><em>The prototype quickly caught everyone’s attention at the studio. What started as a side experiment became a fully-fledged production, and we built a dedicated team around it in 2020. In a way, Spellcasters Chronicles is a very natural extension of nearly three decades of Quantic Dream exploring new forms of interactivity. Since Omikron, we’ve constantly reinvented our grammar, whether through narrative branching, animation or technology through our custom engines and tools. We’ve never repeated ourselves, and we’ve always created original IPs. Adding multiplayer, competitive tension, and social interactions was simply the next step of that evolution.</em></p>



<p><em>And of course, as with all our projects, it’s an original IP conceived by David Cage, whose long-time desire to explore multiplayer gameplay and a high-fantasy universe naturally shaped the creative direction of the project. Spellcasters Chronicles allowed us to finally dive into those themes in a bold, stylized setting.</em></p>



<p><strong>Was it always going to be a free-to-play game? How did the studio fall on that choice, and is it a point of concern with how difficult it is for any game, F2P or not, to garner player attention?</strong></p>



<p><em>Yes, from very early on, we felt that Spellcasters Chronicles needed to be free-to-play. The genre thrives on accessibility: we want players to be able to jump in without barriers, to try different Spellcasters, to experiment with strategies, and to enjoy the competitive ecosystem from day one. But being free-to-play doesn’t mean compromising our values. We’re dedicated to having fair monetization and, above all, to avoiding any pay-to-win elements.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re fully aware of how tough the multiplayer landscape is today, whether you’re free-to-play or premium. But we believe in this project because it comes from our studio’s own DNA. It’s bold, it’s different, and we think players will appreciate that. We also feel the market still rewards originality and sincerity, even in crowded genres. Our job now is to prove ourselves, one update at a time</em>.</p>



<p><strong>What will be the cadence of updates? Are new Spellcasters going to be added</strong> <strong>with each major update? How often will new maps be released?</strong></p>



<p><em>We’re not ready to share a full roadmap yet. But I can say that players can expect a very active update cycle. Major updates and seasonal drops will introduce new Spellcasters, new maps, new summons, new incantations, and even new Titans.</em></p>



<p><em>The goal is to keep the game feeling fresh and reactive to our community. We want players to always have something new to explore, master, and influence!</em></p>



<p><strong>What does it mean for Spellcasters Chronicles to have a "<em>community-driven narrative</em>"?</strong></p>



<p><em>This is one of the aspects we’re most excited about, and one we’ll reveal more about after the early beta phases. Right now, our priority is to let players focus on the core gameplay experience, because we’re not known for multiplayer games and we have a lot to prove. We want the gameplay foundations to speak for themselves first.</em></p>



<p><em>But at a high level: community-driven narrative is about giving players collective influence over the evolution of the universe. Each season, the community will face meaningful choices that can impact the lore, the world, and even gameplay elements. It’s a way of extending something that has always defined Quantic Dream: empowering players to shape stories. Except for this time, instead of individual branching paths, it becomes something shared, a story built by a community.</em></p>



<p><em>This closed beta is just the beginning. As we expand into the macro loop over the coming months, we’ll unveil how players can steer the fate of the world.</em></p>



<p><strong>How long does Quantic Dream expect to support Spellcasters Chronicles?</strong></p>



<p><em>Our intention is to support Spellcasters Chronicles for the long term. This isn’t a short experiment for us, it’s a major new IP and a project we’ve been building passionately for years. We’ve designed the systems, the narrative framework, and the seasonal structure with longevity in mind. Ultimately, the game’s lifespan will also be shaped by the community, and our commitment is simple: as long as players are there and engaged, we will continue to grow the world, expand the roster, and make the experience evolve.</em></p>



<p><strong>What will the game's first year look like?</strong></p>



<p><em>Again, the full roadmap will come later, but the first year is built around seasonal beats. Players can expect new Spellcasters, new maps, new summons, new incantations, Titans, seasonal events, and narrative updates tied to the community’s collective choices. The goal is to make Year One feel full of surprises, setting the tone for everything that will follow.</em></p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
