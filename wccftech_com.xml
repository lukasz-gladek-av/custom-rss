			<p>Just as every week brings another <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-amazon-fire-tv-app-reanimal-kingdom-come-deliverance/">GeForce NOW Thursda</a>y, we also get an <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong> Tuesday, with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/star-trek-voyager-styx-blades-of-greed-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/">a new batch of games</a> adding support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation technology. </p>



<p>This week, two games are launching with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4:<strong> Styx: Blades of Greed</strong>, the return of the stealth-driven action adventure, and <strong>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>, a new strategy management game where you have to try to manage the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager and get the ship out of deep space and back to Earth.</p>



<p>Both games also arrive with support for NVIDIA Reflex and DLSS Super Resolution, which those with the NVIDIA app can upgrade to DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution. </p>



<p><strong>NORSE: Oath of Blood</strong> is another game that's launching this week with support for some of NVIDIA's DLSS technology, arriving with DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution. Once again, if you're using the NVIDIA app, you'll be able to upgrade to DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation and DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution.</p>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S later this week, though you can already check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-blades-of-greed-review-a-sandbox-goblin-adventure/">Francesco De Meo's review of the goblin's return</a>, in which he gave the game a <strong>7.5/10</strong>, and also noted that while the game does suffer from a few technical issues, when you flip the switch for DLSS 4 with Mult-Frame Generation, those issues are smoothed out. </p>



<p>"<em>Despite the technical friction and a 20-hour runtime that becomes slightly repetitive toward the end, </em><em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em> is a <strong>solid stealth title</strong>. It doesn't revolutionize the genre, and it lacks a much-needed in-game map for its sandbox maps, but it compensates with <strong>excellent level design and immense heart</strong>. For fans of the series or those craving a pure stealth experience, <strong>Styx's hunt for Quartz it’s a journey worth taking</strong>," writes De Meo.</p>

			<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has announced a fresh batch of games that are landing soon on <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong>, and there's a lot of love for roleplaying game fans, starting with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-might-join-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously teased <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong></a>.  The first-person historical RPG from <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> will be available starting March 3 on the Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, and PC Game Pass tiers. </p>



<p>In just two days from now, though, another massively acclaimed action RPG will join Game Pass: <strong>CD Projekt RED's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Complete Edition</strong>. Unfortunately, this will only be available via <span>the cloud and on Xbox Series S and X consoles,&nbsp;<strong>leaving PC users out</strong></span>. The game will be playable by Xbox Game Pass Premium and Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>Starting today, subscribers to the Premium tier (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-could-be-merged-with-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored</a> to be under revision by Microsoft, which <strong>is considering a potential merge with PC Game Pass</strong>) can also play <strong>Obsidian's Avowed</strong>. I heartily recommend the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I did in my original review</a>, and <span>it has since been improved, including the recent Anniversary Update that&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-lands-ps5-february-17-2026-anniversary-update-drops-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank">launched</a>&nbsp;alongside its</span> debut on PlayStation 5.</p>
