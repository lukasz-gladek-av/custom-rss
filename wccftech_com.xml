			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lniaufpggs26">published</a> the latest monthly sales charts for US video game sales for March 2025, with Assassin's Creed Shadows at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Shadows was the best-selling game in the US for March 2025, which isn't surprising given that Piscatella had already reported that Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-been-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-its-first-3-weeks-on-the-market/">dominated the weekly sales charts</a> during its first three weeks on the market. And that it had already risen to being the second-best-selling game in 2025 so far, just behind Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Following behind Shadows was MLB The Show 25, which was the second-best-selling game for March 2025, and has risen to the fourth-best-selling game for 2025 so far. Hazelight's latest release, Split-Fiction, made it to the number five spot for best-selling games in March 2025 and was just able to crack the top 10 best-selling games of the year in the number 10 spot.</p>
<p>In terms of player engagement and what was the most-played game for the month, that list is less changed, with Fortnite at the top of the list for monthly active users in March 2025 on consoles. The rest of the list was essentially the same, with the rest of the usual suspects of Marvel Rivals, Minecraft, Roblox, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto V all mostly in their same places as last month or changed by only a day or two.</p>
<p>Regarding hardware sales, PlayStation 5 still came out on top, even with hardware sales declining for the month overall by 25%, and PS5 sales in particular dropping 26%, compared to March 2024. The new Midnight Black DualSense, however, led the accessories sales charts.</p>
<p>All together, a very strong start for Assassin's Creed Shadows, with Ubisoft now hoping to keep the momentum going into the rest of the year.</p>

			<p>The original Nintendo Switch is hardly going to be remembered for its hardware specifications, but with some overclocking and 8 GB of RAM, the system is capable of accomplishing some impressive feats, such as running PlayStation 3 games surprisingly well.</p>
<p>A new video shared this week by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">Naga</a> on YouTube shows how an overclocked Nintendo Switch modded with 8 GB of RAM runs several PlayStation 3 games via the RPCS3 emulator. The results are quite impressive, as the system can run a game like Rayman Origins at 1440p resolution almost flawlessly. Other games are not perfectly emulated, but still run surprisingly well, like the Sly Raccoon and Kingdom Hearts HD remasters. More demanding games like Demon's Souls and Prince of Persia Sands of Time HD, however, don't manage to achieve playable status, but even just seeing them run at 20 FPS or below is impressive enough, considering how demanding PlayStation 3 emulation can be.</p>

<p>Seeing what is <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-above-60-fps/">achievable</a> on an overclocked Nintendo Switch with additional RAM, one can only wonder how far the Nintendo Switch 2's more powerful hardware can be pushed. So far, things are definitely looking bright for the new console, as it's not only way more powerful than its predecessor, but also supports advanced features like ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS. The impressive Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 port has been recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/">confirmed</a> to be the first game using NVIDIA DLSS, so it will be very interesting to see how other developers will be able to take advantage of the upscaler to deliver even better visuals and more stable performance.</p>
