			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> Relaxed Mode mod is now available for download, featuring plenty of QOL improvements that can make the game more enjoyable for those struggling with some of its elements, such as the high challenge level.</p>



<p>The mod, which has been developed by didrio and can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/92?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, features a selection of balance and quality-of-life enhancements that can be fully configured, allowing users to only use some of the features the mod offers. Among these are balance changes with all damage reduced to 1 mask, Rosary Beads and Shards multipliers, healing changes, Swift Step and Clawline no longer consuming silk, health bars for enemies and bosses, increased iframes after receiving damage, and more. Although some of these changes undoubtedly make Hollow Knight: Silksong a little easier, the vast majority of them make for a more enjoyable experience, especially for those who never played the first entry in the series and were unprepared for the high level of challenge the new game shows right from the beginning.</p>



<p>Team Cherry seems to be aware that Hollow Knight: Silksong presents a high challenge level right from the beginning, and has confirmed that some balance changes will be included in the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-team-cherry-first-patch-makes-early-game-easier/">first patch</a>. Specifically, the patch will reduce the difficulty of early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter, reduce damage from Sandcarvers, reduce mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices and more. Personally, I didn't find the two bosses mentioned by Team Cherry to be particularly challenging, but I can definitely see how they can be difficult to take down for players who aren't used to the sort of balancing that's more common in Soulslike games, rather than Metroidvania titles.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing features such as AutoDrive upgrades, Photo Mode adjustments, fixes, and improvements.</p>



<p>The 2.31 patch, which went live earlier today, updates AutoDrive so that the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtaking blocking vehicles and no longer stopping at traffic lights when driving to a selected point of the map. Free Roam mode has also been improved to follow traffic rules and navigate Night City more reliably. The patch also introduced some Photo Mode adjustments, as mentioned above, making most of the new poses introduced in the previous update work with any gender, disabling NPC collisions, and more.</p>



<p>The new Cyberpunk 2077 patch also brings a slew of quests and open world fixes, localization issues, adds a toggle to disable vignette, and addresses some PC and Mac specific issues, such as an issue were NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled and an issue where path tracing didn't activate properly in certain scenarios, ray-traced reflections not displaying correctly under certain conditions, stability and performance improvements and more. You can learn more about everything the 2.31 patch brings to the game in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/503961862016073928?l=english">official patch notes.</a></p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch 2. You can learn more about the excellent Phantom Liberty expansion and the 2.0 update, which massively overhauled most of the gameplay systems, by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/road-kings-gamescom-2025-q-a-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98you-are-the-hero-of-the-open-road%E2%80%99.1294524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment revealed Road Kings, the latest chapter in their successful series of racing simulation games after MudRunner, SnowRunner, Expeditions: A MudRunner Game, and Roadcraft.</p>



<p>Whereas most of the previous games focused on off-road driving, though, this one is squarely aimed at delivering the definitive trucking experience. Players will start out as rookie drivers behind the wheel of a 40-ton semi, hauling cargo across the coastal plains of the American South, from Jacksonville to Savannah. They will have to keep an eye on everything that real truck drivers do, from regulations to fuel, unpredictable weather, and much more. There's even going to be a narrative component that ties everything together, exposing the human element to the drivers and everyone involved in trucking.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to chat with Saber Interactive Porto Game Director Peter Mack and Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits about Road Kings, which is scheduled to launch at some point in 2026 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141130/Road_Kings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X consoles (a Nintendo Switch 2 port is still under evaluation).</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Peter, which game did you work on before this?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This is the first project I've worked on at Saber Porto. My experience before this was working with smaller LEGO games at another company, but I've now been with Saber Porto for many years.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so this is the first project you've been doing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> With Saber Porto, yes.</p>



<p><strong>How long have you been working on this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> This project started production around three years ago and was in pre-production for a year before that.</p>



<p><strong>Does this run on your proprietary engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> No, it's Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using any of the signature features, such as Lumen and Nanite?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes, we're taking advantage of a lot of features that are now available.</p>



<p><strong>I don't know if you can share that, but is Road Kings also coming to the Nintendo Switch 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I would have to get back to you on that.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> We haven't quite decided that. Yeah, we're investigating it, but we're looking at our pipeline and stuff. One of the things to add to his answer about technology is that yes, it runs on Unreal, but we are leveraging the knowledge and experience that Saber has developed with Snowrunner, road crab, Mudrunner, you know, and any fantastic. We know vehicles. We know big vehicles, and we know trucks. You can really feel that it's solid, real, when driving. We have been praised for our realistic simulations.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Saber has done many racing simulation projects about trucks and stuff like that. Where does Road Kings sit in this portfolio?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I feel this is a spiritual successor to all of the simulation-centered titles that have come before it. It's inspired by them and it makes a very nice complement to Saber's other racing simulations.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Yep. Right in the middle! We are very proud of it. We've added that Saber spirit to it, where you are the hero of the open road. It is a true truck simulator, but you do so much more. You help people in need, you help communities in need...</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> It's very human.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> It's about trucks. At its core, it's a truck simulator. But we also understand that the interesting things are really the people and the lives surrounding trucks. It's about human relations and how the trucking business affects the people in it. It's history, it's tradition. It's all important, all part of the experience. It's not just about the gearheads and the machines, so we try to incorporate as much of that as we can.</p>



<p><strong>You said there is a story in Road Kings. Can you talk a bit about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. As I was just saying, trucks are a huge part of society, so they are involved in a lot of very important things to a lot of people. We tried to create a story that touches on these facts and what we've learned by talking with truck drivers and understanding their lives. We tried to create a narrative that the player, as part of an immersive simulation, can engage with or not. If you like to just sort of work and drive for long-haul trips over the road, you can, but if you want to engage with a sort of narrative experience, you can do that, too.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> Especially in America, where trucking is very important. The country is really big, and we don't have trains like in Europe, so the trucking culture in America is very unique. Tapping on what Peter said about that spirit and human factor, that is really important.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There are also all the changes that are happening in the industry right now. When we were doing research for Road Kings, we were reading about and speaking with people about their fears about the impact technology has on trucking. If you look at blogs lately, it's about autonomous trucks and when they are coming and what they are going to do to this very important aspect of society that has existed in the United States for hundreds of years, and how it's going to be affected. Along with that, there's the change in the technology of the trucks. There is a change going on in the climate and the increasingly unpredictable weather, which often affects drivers and puts them in danger. All these things are for us narrative components to bring into stories you encounter in the game..</p>



<p><strong>Can you share how long the story of Road Kings is going to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I understand it's topping out at about 10 hours of gaming, but that's pretty much if you sail right through and if you do story beat after story beat.</p>



<p><strong>Tim Willits:</strong> I mean, it's a simulation game. You can play forever beyond the story.</p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> There is also a layer of procedurally generated conditions and stories that you can encounter. For example, the dispatcher can call you up. Again, taken right from the pages of drivers, blogs, and diaries, they call you up and tell you that they made a mistake and the job you're doing is wrong, and can you do them a favour and take it to the other side of the state? And if you say yes, if it's convenient and makes sense, you get a reputation with the dispatcher, and if you say no, you get paid as normal. So, in addition to it being endless in terms of the simulation, there's even the sort of endless aspect to the small stories you can encounter.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The weather is dynamic, right? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Does it include icy conditions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Let us get up toward Missouri and we can talk about that, but right now you're in sort of north Florida to southern Georgia. So, we don't have snowstorms for now, but we're looking at it.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk about the asynchronous multiplayer mode?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Sure. Right now, we have an online mode in which you can create and customize your own company and invite your friends to join. Each of you can do jobs in your own environment, which contributes to your company's success, growing its worth and capital. But it's asynchronous, so you don't see them driving around, although they do appear in the game, I believe, with their liveries and such that they've chosen for their truck.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a leaderboard for the player-created companies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Is it cross-platform? Can you invite a friend who plays the game on another platform?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Indeed!</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to support Road Kings post-launch, with more content and features?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> Absolutely. 100%. We already have a lot of content planned for after launch. We find that this game lends itself very easily and naturally to expansion, not just in terms of geography, but in terms of truck types and customizations. All is expandable post-launch, but we also see very easily that we can add more stories and more narratives and more dispatchers, and more companies. I think we have fifteen more companies already lined up to be considered.</p>



<p><strong>Would these be premium DLCs, or possibly some free DLCs, too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Peter Mack:</strong> I think we're looking at a plan that includes all of the above.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you both for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-sold-200k-units-no-plan-sequel/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-has-sold-200k-units-so-far-and-there%E2%80%99s-no-plan-for-a-sequel.1294464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, Bloober Team <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/report/espi-30-2025-wyniki-sprzedazy-gry-cronos-the-new-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed with a brief notice</a> that its new sci-fi horror game Cronos: The New Dawn has sold 200K units digitally in the first three days. It's not terrible, but it's not great, either, especially since the game was released on all major platforms, including the record-breaking console Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>It's way too early to spell doom for the Polish studio, anyway. CEO Piotr Babieno told <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-nie-widzi-zagrozenia-dla-Cronos-The-New-Dawn-w-zwiazku-z-debiutem-Hollow-Knight-Silksong-wywiad-9003011.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankier.pl</a> that the budget of Cronos: The New Dawn was lower than estimated by investors, which means it won't take that much to recoup the investment:</p>



<p><em>We also noticed that the costs of creating Cronos: The New Dawn were estimated at over PLN 100 million ($27.4 million). I can assure you that the development budget was certainly not that high, and even though we are counting on very good sales results, the break-even point is not as high as analysts indicate. We are completely confident about the company's investment growth and earnings. All our analyses indicate that things will be fine, but we will of course report on sales levels when we reach significant milestones.</em></p>



<p>Babieno also confirmed that there are no current plans for a sequel, although a transmedia expansion to cinema or TV is certainly possible. On the development side, Bloober is preparing even larger titles for the next couple of years, which Babieno believes will be even better than 2025 for the studio.</p>



<p>For those still on the fence for Cronos: The New Dawn, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here's our review</a> penned by Francesco De Meo, who thoroughly enjoyed the experience and rated it 8 out of 10.</p>



<p><em>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-mode-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%98deep-of-night%E2%80%99-mode-is-out-now.1294446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-high-difficulty-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> yesterday, FromSoftware has now released a free update for Elden Ring Nightreign, adding the brand new Deep of Night mode to the game.</p>



<p>This was designed as an endgame challenge for experienced players. Deep of Night can hide the Nightlord and Shifting Earth from players until battle begins. Enemies across Limveld will be more challenging, and random enemies will be mutated, potentially presenting greater dangers to players, who, however, can oppose these strengthened foes with new weapon enhancements. Beware, though, as some of these weapon enhancements could also have detrimental effects, such as increasing the amount of damage players take. </p>



<p>Players must be highly selective if they hope to survive the night and ultimately defeat the Nightlord. Three new relic slots have been introduced exclusively for Depths Relics, a new reward players can earn while playing the Deep of Night game mode. These Depths Relics can provide powerful enhancements, but, as with the new variant weapons, they also come at a cost. Victory will require skillful calculation and execution. Deep of Night mode is meant explicitly for the bravest Nightfarers, providing an extreme challenge and showing players the darkest depths of the game, including the dreadful possibility of unknowingly facing an Everdark Sovereign Nightlord.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is the latest in a series of successful game releases by FromSoftware. While not quite as critically acclaimed as its predecessor, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already sold five million units in the first month of its release</a>. Meanwhile, the Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree reached 10 million units.</p>



<p>Even Hollywood noticed the franchise's popularity. In late May, a live-action film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>; it will be produced by A24 and Bandai Namco. Alex Garland, the man behind 28 Days Later, Dredd, Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, and Warfare, is attached to direct and write the script. </p>
