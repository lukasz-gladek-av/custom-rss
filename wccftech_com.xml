			<p>Troy Baker is a staple voice actor in the gaming sphere, and it's no surprise that he'll be making a return to Naughty Dog's new untitled game. For this title, Neil Druckmann will be at the helm, the mind behind The Last of Us and Uncharted. At the moment, there is no real information about the project, but <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GQ has confirmed</a> that Troy Baker has signed on to appear in the title in some capacity. It's not stated whether he'll be playing a big or small role, but it's positive that his voice will be recognized by many who dig into the upcoming project.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog has had a little bit of a difficult time, as they decided to cancel The Last of Us Online in December last year. This was an attempt to create a live service version of the beloved franchise, especially after the first season of the TV show did so well. The Last of Us did have multiplayer game modes before, where you could face off against other factions in combat. While they were trying to make The Last of Us Online, they said that they had to pull it as the studio would have had to funnel all of its resources into post-launch content for many years to come. By doing this, it would have heavily impacted any single-player games that they would be producing.</p>
<p>When The Last of Us Online was shut down, Naughty Dog confirmed that there was an ambitious single-player game in the works, but there have been no details released about the game since that announcement.</p>
<p>While there are minimal details about the upcoming Naughty Dog project, Druckmann has stated that he wants to breakaway from being known as the studio behind The Last of Us, and wants recognition for other projects. "I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us Studio forever," said Druckmann in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-as-it-works-on-multiple-single-player-projects-neil-druckmann-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with IGN</a> in June.</p>
<p>Whether we will see any details emerge about this project in the near future remains to be seen. However, you'll be able to spot Troy Baker on the screen again soon as he is set to play Indiana Jones in MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
