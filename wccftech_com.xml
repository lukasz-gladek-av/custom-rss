			<p>The <strong>BioShock movie adaptation</strong> has been in discussion for a long time. Less than a year after the original game's debut, publisher <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> announced that it had signed a deal with <strong>Universal Studios</strong> for a film that would have been directed by <strong>Gore Verbinski</strong> (The Ring, the first three Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Lone Ranger) and written by <strong>John Logan</strong> (Gladiator, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Skyfall, and Spectre). </p>



<p>The tentative theatrical release window was <strong>2010</strong>, but the project kept being put on hold for various concerns, including budget and the director's insistence on making it R-rated. Eventually, it was cancelled, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-cancelled-weeks-before-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verbinski would reveal years later</a></strong> that it only happened a few weeks before filming was supposed to begin.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to August 2022, and Take-Two <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found new partners for the BioShock movie adaptation</a>: <strong>Netflix</strong> and <strong>Vertigo Entertainment</strong>. This new project has been assigned to <strong>Francis Lawrence</strong>, the director of Constantine, I Am Legend, The Hunger Games, and most recently, The Long Walk. <strong>Michael Green</strong> (Logan, Alien: Covenant, Blade Runner 2049) was originally supposed to write. The BioShock movie is also supposed to have <strong>franchise creator Ken Levine involved in some capacity</strong>, or at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-has-ken-levine-involved-in-some-capacity-director-explains-what-makes-the-ip-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that's what we were told in late 2022</a>.</p>



<p>However, there were delays this time as well. In July 2024, at San Diego Comic-Con, producer <strong>Rory Lee</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-is-still-going-forward-albeit-with-a-reduced-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the project was still alive, but <strong>Netflix had reduced the budget, making it a more personal experience rather than a sprawling epic</strong>. Last year, the film director himself, Francis Lawrence, said progress was finally being made, based on a new screenplay penned by <strong>Justin Rhodes</strong> (Terminator: Dark Fate, Secret Level). </p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider has </a><span><a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank">received an update from producer Rory Lee</a>, who shared that the project should finally be</span> made once Lawrence is done with the latest The Hunger Games film. Perhaps even more interestingly for gamers, he claims that <strong>Take-Two and Netflix are planning to have the BioShock movie launch coincide with the release of the new game</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being The Long Walk and the other being The Hunger Games prequel, which comes out this December. We're just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he's going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it. I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.</em></p>



<p><strong>The next BioShock game also ran into major trouble</strong> throughout its development. First <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in December 2019 to be in the works at <strong>Cloud Chamber</strong>, it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly rebooted several times</a></strong>. In August 2025, it was announced that <strong>Rod Fergusson</strong> (Gears of War, Diablo) <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been brought in as the new studio head</a> to help hone the focus ahead of the game's final stages. </p>



<p>Fergusson has a proven track record of doing exactly that, and indeed the same happened with the last BioShock game released, <strong>2013's Infinite</strong>, with Fergusson hired in 2012 ahead of the game's March 2013 launch. It looks like he'll have more time with the next BioShock, which is now <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be targeting a late 2027 debut</a></strong>. That's two solid years of working on polishing and refining the game.</p>



<p>Of course, the game could always slip. Still, after a long wait on both fronts, it looks like we can expect both the BioShock movie and the BioShock game in 2027-2028, as Take-Two and Netflix hope they'll feed on each other's hype. By the way, old rumors suggested <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-sequel-set-in-antarctica-1960s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game could take place in Antarctica</a></strong>, but who knows if that changed in all these years.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly nine years since the launch of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-automata-genre-bending-every-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NieR: Automata</a></strong>, the highly acclaimed action RPG developed by <strong>PlatinumGames</strong> and published by <strong>Square Enix</strong>. Fans have long been waiting for news of a sequel. Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyn1b_5bw-M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as part of a celebration for the game's latest sales milestone</a> (<strong>it has now sold 10 million units</strong> across all platforms), they at least got a teaser.</p>

<p>It sounds like the gears are finally moving. But why did it take so long? Well, it seems like Game Director <strong>Yoko Taro</strong> and Square Enix found it hard to reach an agreement. The outspoken creative first <a href="http://wccftech.com/nier-automata-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that a NieR: Automata sequel would be something nobody would have thought about</a>; a few months later, in March 2018, Taro <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-thinks-hell-make-failures-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the belief that his next projects would not be as successful</a>, so <strong>his goal was to make as much money as he could</strong>.</p>



<p>In April 2018,  he <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/taro-if-square-enix-gives-me-money-i-will-create-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled down on his previous statement</a>, <strong>calling on Square Enix to give him money if they wanted a NieR: Automata sequel</strong>: </p>



<p><em>If Square-Enix gives me money, I will create anything. So I think let Square-Enix know and I think if Square-Enix wants it, I'll do it.</em></p>



<p>However, nothing really came of it. Sure, Yoko Taro worked on the now-defunct gacha mobile <strong>Nier Reincarnation</strong> and the small-scale RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/voice-of-cards-the-isle-dragon-roars-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars</a></strong>, but beyond that, he was pretty quiet these last few years. A few months ago, he finally broke the silence to <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-has-been-working-on-multiple-projects-they-just-kept-getting-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal</a> that he had actually worked on several projects, but <strong>most of them never even got released</strong>. He was fine with it since he got paid, though. Perhaps now Square Enix and Yoko Taro have finally reached a financial agreement, though fans remain skeptical and wonder if the publisher is truly referring to the long-awaited NieR: Automata sequel.</p>



<p>By the way, the publisher also announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nier-replicant-ver-1-22474487139-whats-the-square-root-of-1-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139</strong></a> has sold <strong>over 2 million units to date</strong>.</p>
