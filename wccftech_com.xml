			<p>Renowned virtual reality modder Luke Ross <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed yesterday</a> that his <strong>Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod</strong> was taken down after a DMCA request from the game's developer, <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>.</p>



<p>The mod allowed virtual reality gamers to experience the splendor of Night City through their headsets, significantly increasing immersion. It was originally released in <strong>late February 2022</strong>, so it's not like it's anything new. It is unclear exactly what prompted CDPR to take action now; perhaps they were simply unaware so far, and someone brought the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod to their attention just recently.</p>



<p>And no, <strong>it's not that the game development studio is working on an official VR mode for their game</strong>. Luke Ross says that explicitly, having actually been able to talk this through with CDPR's VP of business development and legal department (unlike what happened a few years ago with <a href="https://wccftech.com/vr-modder-luke-ross-gets-dmca-notice-for-his-rdr2-gta-and-mafia-vr-mods/"><strong>Take-Two</strong>'s DMCA takedown of his <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>, <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>, and <strong>Mafia Definitive Edition</strong> VR mods</a>, when Ross couldn't get through to anyone there).</p>



<p>The VR modder was very bitter in his Patreon post, complaining about the 'duplicity with which the corpo mind thinks and reacts. The bottom line is all that matters, and gamers be damned.' That said, looking at the comments on Reddit, forum boards, and social media, many gamers are not very surprised. Companies can't allow others to profit from their own IPs without a license, after all, and this could have been avoided if Ross simply released the mod for free and then asked for donations to his Patreon. </p>



<p>CD Projekt RED doesn't have any problem with free mods, as evidenced by their support of the modding communities of <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> and Cyberpunk 2077. They even <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released the full mod tools (<strong>REDkit</strong>) for the former</a> a couple of years ago, encouraging more modders to tinker with the game. Cyberpunk 2077 is the fastest-growing game on Nexus by mod downloads, having just surpassed <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong> and being only behind <strong>Skyrim</strong> (both base and Special Edition) and <strong>Fallout 4</strong> when it comes to total mod downloads.</p>



<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod <strong>was instead hidden behind the paywall</strong>, though, which prompted the legal action. That said, the modder isn't quitting. In fact, he just <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/looking-down-at-148469092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new VR mod for <strong>Larian's Baldur's Gate 3</strong>, a challenging proposition since it uses an isometric-style camera (albeit in a fully 3D game) that the modder hadn't yet converted to virtual reality. Once again, though, it is locked behind the paywall, potentially inviting legal action by license holder Wizards of the Coast.</p>



<p>In other news, VR gaming just took a major hit, with Meta <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down three of its studios</a> (<strong>Sanzaru Games</strong>, <strong>Twisted Pixel</strong>, and <strong>Armature Studio</strong>) as part of its 10% layoffs at the Reality Labs division. <strong>Camouflaj</strong>, the developer behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/republique-review-zeroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">République</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-iron-man-vr-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron Man VR</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a></strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was also affected by layoffs</a>, canceling its Arkham Shadow sequel and reportedly abandoning any future VR gaming projects.</p>

						<h5>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 for Xbox</h5><p><span>October 2025</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p><strong>SteelSeries</strong> has a habit of releasing headsets that don’t try to reinvent the wheel every generation, but instead quietly tighten the bolts. The original <strong>Nova 7</strong> was already one of the safer picks in the mid‑range segment. With the <strong>Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2</strong>, SteelSeries aims to refine rather than overhaul: longer battery life, proper simultaneous dual‑wireless support, and a bit more polish in both software and daily use.</p>



<p>The Nova 7X Gen 2 <strong>sits in that sweet spot between price, versatility, and comfort</strong>. And while it’s not a dramatic generational leap, <strong>the changes it brings are meaningful in ways you feel every day you use it</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260108_114701316-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-design-amp-features">Design &amp; Features</h2>



<p>At first glance, the Nova 7X Gen 2 looks virtually identical to its predecessor. SteelSeries keeps the familiar matte-black design, the metal headband, and the elastic ski‑goggle strap that provides its signature comfort. The earcups use the same breathable AirWeave material that avoids heat buildup, and the entire package feels lightweight but not fragile.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2035/08/PXL_20260108_114718620-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 with USB-C dongle</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What <em>is</em> new is the improved dual‑wireless implementation. <strong>The headset can now run 2.4 GHz audio and Bluetooth simultaneously</strong>, not just on a “switch between them” basis. This is great for anyone who runs Discord mobile, takes calls during matches, or likes streaming music while gaming without muting the game audio. SteelSeries also expands its software ecosystem with better Sonar EQ controls and a companion mobile app, making on‑the‑fly adjustments far less of a chore.</p>



<p>One thing that caught me off guard: the button layout. After years of using other headsets (including SteelSeries’ own models), it took genuine muscle‑memory rewiring to accept that the power button sits on the right earcup and the volume wheel on the left. It’s not wrong, just <em>different</em> — and the first few days, I found myself reaching for the wrong side more often than I’d like to admit.</p>



<p>A more objective downside is the wide USB‑C dongle, which can block neighboring ports depending on your setup. It’s a known complaint across multiple reviews, and one I ran into as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-comfort">Comfort</h2>



<p>Comfort remains one of SteelSeries’ strongest pillars, and the Nova 7X Gen 2 stays firmly in that tradition. The headband suspension system evenly distributes pressure across the top of your head, and despite the metal frame, <strong>the headset never feels heavy or fatiguing</strong>. The breathable AirWeave cushions avoid heat buildup, and the clamping force sits in that ideal middle ground — secure, but never tight.</p>

<p>As I’ve mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-5x-wireless-first-class/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in previous reviews</a>, <strong>the SteelSeries headsets are among the few headsets that don’t give me strain on my head after prolonged use</strong>. Even after long sessions across several evenings, the Nova 7X Gen 2 <strong>remained as comfortable as when I first put it on</strong>, which is more than I can say for most mid‑range wireless headsets.</p>



<h2 id="h-sound-amp-microphone">Sound &amp; Microphone</h2>



<p>The Nova 7X Gen 2 sticks to SteelSeries’ typical tuning: clean mids, clear positional cues, and a balanced low end that avoids the muddy, over‑boosted bass found in some competitors. Out of the box, the treble can lean a bit sharp at times, but this is easily smoothed out using Sonar EQ profiles. For competitive gaming, <strong>the directional audio is trustworthy and consistent</strong>. You don’t get the hyper‑detailed imaging of SteelSeries’ own Nova Pro line, but at this price, the performance is excellent.</p>



<p>The retractable boom mic works well for party chat and everyday use, but it isn’t a standout feature. Voices sound slightly thin and lack warmth, matching what many reviewers have noted. It gets the job done and remains reliable, but <strong>don’t expect broadcast clarity or deep vocal richness</strong>. There’s no active noise cancellation on the headset, so microphone performance relies heavily on SteelSeries’ software filters.</p>



<h2 id="h-battery-life">Battery Life</h2>



<p>Battery improvements are one of the most tangible Gen 2 upgrades. <strong>SteelSeries rates the Nova 7X Gen 2 for 50+ hours, and real‑world use backs this up</strong>. Even with Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz running at the same time, I went several days without charging. Fast charging via USB‑C is another welcome convenience: about <strong>15 minutes on the cable nets you several hours of gameplay</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-compatibility">Compatibility</h2>



<p>SteelSeries’ model segmentation can still be confusing, but here’s the part that really matters: the Xbox version is the one you want if you own multiple platforms. Just like previous SteelSeries headsets, the Nova 7X Gen 2 works on both Xbox and PlayStation, while the PlayStation version does not work on Xbox. That means anyone gaming across both ecosystems should choose the Xbox model to avoid limitations.</p>

<p>Beyond consoles, the 7X Gen 2 <strong>works flawlessly on PC, Switch (via dongle), and mobile via Bluetooth</strong>. Switching between devices is quick, and simultaneous Bluetooth + 2.4 GHz support makes it easy to mix audio sources without juggling buttons or transmitters.</p>

						<section>
				<p>The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 isn’t a revolutionary step forward, but it delivers exactly the upgrades that improve daily use: stronger battery life, true dual‑wireless, robust software support, and the same exceptional comfort the series is known for. The mic and dongle quirks keep it from being flawless, but as a well-rounded mid‑range wireless headset — especially for Xbox players, and especially if you also own a PlayStation — it’s hard to beat.</p>
