			<p>Yesterday, during the Indie Horror Showcase hosted by DreadXP, Nightdive Studios released a new gameplay trailer for The Thing Remastered. The new trailer provides a detailed look at the bloody and mangled events inside Outpost #31 and the crew's desperation as they attempt to escape from a gruesome, corporeal alien menace.</p>
<p>The Thing Remastered is a remaster of 2002's squad-based third-person shooter horror game. Originally developed by Computer Artworks, it was obviously based on John Carpenter's seminal horror movie, released in 1982. Nightdive Studios, which specializes in remasters and remakes (<a href="https://wccftech.com/quake-ii-remaster-announced-quake-ii-64-new-expansion-machingames/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quake II</a>, DOOM and DOOM II, System Shock, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-turok-2-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok</a>, Blade Runner, and Star Wars: Dark Forces just to name a few), has ported the old game to its proprietary KEX engine. This enabled a series of improvements: 4K resolution and up to 120 frames per second support, not to mention enhancements to character models, textures, animations, lighting, and atmospheric effects. Nightdive has also added brand new Trophies and Achievements on all platforms.</p>
<p>The Thing Remastered is slated to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. For more info on the remaster, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-xsufeLmxk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nightdive's Deep Dive podcast</a>.</p>

<p><em>You are Cpt J.F. Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate the blood-curdling events and enigmatic deaths of the American scientific team that transpired at the Outpost 31 research facility located in the frozen wastelands of Antarctica. Within these inhospitable surroundings your team encounters a strange shape-shifting alien life-form that assumes the appearance of people that it kills. Trapped by the elements and infected by this horrific entity, using all your team members is critical if you hope to accomplish your objectives, let alone survive.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In 20 frightening levels, lead your team against terrifying monsters, from the scuttling head-spiders and human-like walkers to gigantic multi-tentacled beasts.</em></li>
<li><em>Advanced trust/fear interface adds a new level of interaction â€“ How you influence your team's psychological state determines whether or not they will co-operate with you.</em></li>
<li><em>Use awesome firepower like machine guns, explosives, and flamethrowers to torch your enemies.</em></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fawzi-mesmar-becomes-creative-director-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has been a long-term concern by fans of the first game that Beyond Good and Evil 2 was no longer in the works. However, it was recently confirmed that it is, and now we've received news via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fawzi-mesmar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> that Fawzi Mesmar is joining the team as Creative Director. This was announced publicly on LinkedIn, with Mesmar announcing his new role at Ubisoft Montpellier, after previously working as Vice President of Editorial over at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Emile Morel was the previous Creative Director for the title but unfortunately passed away suddenly last year. This led to Mesmar filling the role. This industry veteran has over 20 years of experience in the industry, working for companies such as DICE, King, and Gameloft. He additionally won an Ambassador Award at the 2024 Game Developer's Choice Awards.</p>
<p>For many, this news comes as a shock, as Beyond Good and Evil 2 was first announced in 2008, with a trailer being released during Ubisoft's 2017 E3 conference, and there has been very minimal information about the sequel since then. The original director Michel Ancel even left Ubisoft in 2020, and now works in a wildlife sanctuary instead. However, he is now consulting on a new Rayman project.</p>
<p>While there hasn't been any news on Beyond Good and Evil 2, a 4K remake of the original was released earlier this year. However, this meant that the original version of the game was removed, and people were forced to buy the 20th Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>With Beyond Good and Evil 2 still reportedly being in development, this now makes it the longest development time for a AAA game, with Duke Nukem Forever's record being fifteen years. It's said that development has taken so long due to toxic leadership, chaotic direction and constant gridlock when it came to making decisions about how the game was going to look, and what features would be in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to Fawzi Mesmar joining the team, Francide Coldeboeuf is now taking over as Producer on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">struggles Ubisoft</a> has been dealing with their other projects, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/"> XDefiant</a> not performing to their expectations, it's quite a surprise that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development all these years later.</p>
<p>However, the title has reportedly passed an internal milestone with positive feedback from the leadership, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Kotaku</a>. Whether that means that the game is actually progressing nicely is uncertain, and it's anyone's guess as to when the audience will finally see this game come to fruition.</p>
