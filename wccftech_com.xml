			<p>In addition to the 23 versatile Jobs available for every unit, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles features 12 unique characters, each with a powerful, exclusive Job Command. Here is our tier list for these special units, highlighting which characters are essential to create a party that can deal with all sorts of enemies.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note: This Job Tier list is based on Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty, with rankings determined by each unit’s utility at the time of joining and in the endgame, growth potential, and skill set synergy with Jobs other than their unique main Job. The ranking is largely applicable to other difficulty settings and Classic Mode. Screenshots were captured from the 1.0 Steam release.</strong></em></p>

<h3 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cidolfus Orlandeau is the best character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cidolfus Orlandeau</strong> - The Sword Saint has always been considered as the best character in the game since the original, and this holds in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles as well, despite some damage nerfs. His starting weapon, the Knight Sword Excalibur, and his Swordplay Job giving him access to Physical Attack-based ranged AOE, ranged equipment breaking, and self-healing, make him an absolute powerhouse that lets him solo entire maps and break the game's difficulty <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Ramza Beoulve</strong> - The main protagonist of Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not as broken as Orlandeau, but is still an extremely capable character thanks to the his unique Mettle command that gives him access to some powerful support abilities like Tailwind, Steel, and Shout, which increases his Bravery, Physical Attack, Magic Attack, and Speed. His Squire Job, which becomes Gallant Knight in Chapter 4, also provides him with some great equipment options, and the great PA and MA growth make him a highly versatile, customizable character who can deal with any foe in the game. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 1)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Agrias Oaks joins early in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, and remains a great character until the end of the game</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Agrias Oaks</strong> - The Holy Knight protector of Princess Ovelia is the first powerhouse to join Ramza in his quest, and she stays very useful until the end of the game thanks to her versatility. Her Holy Sword Job Command gives her access to useful Physical Attack-based AOE attacks that can also cause status ailments, while her relatively high Magical Attack can be taken advantage of to give her better support capabilities with the White Magic Job Command. Her lower Physical Attack, however, requires some investment to bring it closer to Orlandeau's or Ramza's. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 2)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Beowulf Cadmus </strong>- The Templar is among the most divisive special characters in the game, but his utility far outweighs his shortcomings. Although his starting Bravery is low and his Physical Attack is not great, the Spellblade Job Command gives him access to status ailment-inducing skills that require no charge time, outclassing the Mystic Job significantly and giving him the potential to take down enemies with a single hit via the Break skill. By increasing his Magic Attack, the Spellblade abilities also gain increased hit chance, making Beowulf even more useful in a variety of situations.   <em>(</em><em>Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>)</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Reis Dular </strong>- While her special Job, Dragonkin, provides situational yet solid utility with ranged attack and support most of the time, her HP, Physical Attack, and Magic Attack growth, and her high starting Bravery and Faith stats make for a versatile character that can make every generic Job shine, regardless of whether PA or MA oriented.                                                                                                                                                       <em></em><em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>. Her human form is unlocked after completing a sidequest available after winning the battle in Zeltennia)</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Meliadoul Tingel</strong> - The Divine Knight is a solid Physical Attack-oriented character who can break enemy equipment from range with her Unyielding Blade abilities. Although her usability has been improved in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles over the original by making these abilities deal damage against monsters, Meliadoul is the last special character to join Ramza, and with her limited versatility, she requires more investment than the best characters in the game to shine. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though his damage output falls off in the late game, Mustadio Bunanza remains a great utility character throughout Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rapha Galthena</strong> - The Skyseer comes with one of the most unique Job Commands in the game, Sky Mantra, which gives her access to powerful elemental spells that do not require MP, scale with Magic Attack, and ignore her Faith, which can deal very high damage multiple times. Unfortunately, these spells randomly hit their AOE, making them unreliable, even with the increased hit chance at the center tile of the AOE improvement. Still, her high Magic Attack growth and her high starting Faith make her an excellent mage with some time investment. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mustadio Bunanza</strong> - The Machinist is the first special character to join Ramza, and his utility stays high for the entirety of the game, thanks to his weapon of choice, Guns, and the Aimed Shot Job Command that can Disable and Immobilize enemies, and turn undead to stone. While his damage heavily falls off later on, requiring the rare elemental guns to keep up with the output of other characters, his utility does not, making him a solid choice for some battles where preventing enemies from acting is more important than dealing damage. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 2)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><span><strong>Byblos</strong>&nbsp;- The unique demon character who joins Ramza out of nowhere after clearing the game's optional endgame dungeon, Midlight's Deep, is a strong monster character with excellent</span> stats and versatile skills that make it useful in various<span> situations.</span> However, being unable to change its equipment and its Job, and its late joining when the game is essentially over impacts its utility considerably, as its only real use is in random battles and the game's final gauntlet of battles. <em>(Recruited after completing Midlight's Deep in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-c-tier">C Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cloud Strife requires a lot of investment to be a good character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Strife </strong>- The stranded Final Fantasy VII protagonist has his Limit Break attacks as his Soldier Job Command, but even starting with the Materia Blade required to use them, the enhanced Materia Blade+ obtainable with the Treasure Hunter ability at the highest point of the Mount Bervenia map, and the reduced charge time are not enough to make him as strong as other special characters in the game. Still, he can hold his own with some skills, like the Time Mage's Swiftness to speed up his abilities' charge time, but as he joins quite late, the time investment will not be worth it for most players. <em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available after winning the battle in Zeltennia in Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Construct 8</strong> - The Steel Giant is a real powerhouse under the right conditions. Its high Physical Attack makes its skillset extremely powerful, and its immunity to status ailments is a welcome bonus. However, his inability to enter water severely limits his mobility on most maps, and being unable to change gear or Job severely hinders its versatility, making it an extremely situational character. <em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-d-tier">D Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Encumbered by how the mechanics powering his Nether Mantra skills, Marach Galthena is the worst special character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marach Galthena</strong> - On paper, the Netherseer has the potential of being as powerful as his sister Rapha, but in reality, he leaves a lot to be desired. His Nether Mantra skills, which work like Rapha's Sky Mantra, are more effective the lower his Faith his, but this makes it impossible to build him as an effective mage. Marach's base Job does not have great HP and Physical Attack,  so he needs a complete Job change into a Physical Attack-based class to be somewhat useful and take limited advantage of his Nether Mantra unique Job Command. This time investment for a character that essentially ends up being little more than a generic unit makes Marach the worst special character in the game. (<em>Recruited in Chapter 4</em>)</li>

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming soon to PlayStation Plus Extra, according to renowned leaker billbil-kun. In a post <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">published on Dealabs.com</a>, the leaker said the game should join Sony's middle PS Plus tier on October 21.  Billbil-kun is well-informed on these announcements. Just recently, the leaker had revealed in advance that Remedy's Alan Wake 2 would be added to the PlayStation Plus Essential lineup, which Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed during the latest State of Play presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Bloober Team and KONAMI launched the Silent Hill 2 remake a year ago, receiving widespread critical and fan acclaim after pre-release skepticism. On Wccftech, Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 9 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>To date, the game has sold more than two million units, persuading KONAMI to <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partner once again with Bloober Team to remake the first installment in the revered horror franchise</a>, too. Meanwhile, the incredibly prolific Polish studio has already launched another sci-fi horror game based on its own brand-new franchise, Cronos: New Dawn. This game also received a solid score (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8/10</a>) on Wccftech from reviewer Francesco De Meo: </p>



<p><em>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ninja-gaiden-4-tokyo-game-show-2025-hands-on-preview.1318318/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>First revealed at the start of the year during Xbox’s Developer Direct, Team Ninja and PlatinumGames have been working on a sequel to their HD trilogy of the long-running Ninja Gaiden series, with the first new title in more than a decade. While protagonist Ryu Hayabusa is still a driving force behind the narrative, this upcoming character action title focuses on a new hero: Yakumo, a Raven clan ninja and descendant of the Dark Dragon, who has been an antagonist of the Hayabusa clan throughout most of the series’ lifetime.</p>



<p>Not one to shy away from excessive amounts of blood and dismemberment, NINJA GAIDEN 4 is among the bloodiest action games I’ve played in a long time. Land a finishing blow on an enemy soldier, and their limbs will fly off, accompanied by a gratuitous shower of blood. While getting bathed in blood might be a core mechanic to the game, ala SUDA51’s recent roguelike Hotel Barcelona, it’s enough to make a squeamish ninja dog want to find the accessibility options and turn the blood splatter off. Yakumo can take advantage of the liquid potential to power up his Bloodraven form, a technique unique to him and a first for the series to take blood and utilize it as an attacking tool.</p>



<p>Yakumo is just as proficient in the art of the blade as series veteran Ryu Hayabusa and can bring a variety into combat, from the trusty katana to a thrusting spear and heavier hammer. Yakumo can don a pair of weapons at a time, with the second of the set being used for blood-based counterattacks and combo finishers. I gravitated towards the thrusting sword, something more akin to a war rapier than the type you’d find in fencing, that would transform into a massive drill in its bloodied form. While this wasn’t as effective against groups of enemies at a time, I still had access to the series staple Flying Swallow maneuver to dispatch enemies surrounding Yakumo, but just outside of melee range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside of boss fights, Yakumo is rarely caught in one-on-one situations, with enemy grunts preferring to group up on the solitary ninja from all angles. A soft target lock makes it easy to angle your attacks mid-combo from an enemy from one side to the next before launching them into the air and continuing your attacks in an aerial combo. Yakumo can also throw shuriken to preserve his combo momentum and temporarily stun enemies as he runs in for the approach. Swapping between weapon sets is just a button press away, and Yakumo can swap from his thrusting sword to a massive staff to twirl about and continue the onslaught, depending on the situation. Having this weapon transform into a massive rocket-powered hammer means it can be the best tool for breaking an enemy’s guard and armor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as the modern series is known for, Ninja Gaiden 4 is a masterclass in fast-paced ninja action and giving the player a multitude of tools to try and survive among the higher difficulty compared to other character action games. Yakumo can bring a limited number of healing items to battle, but he can just as easily recover a large chunk of lost health by way of his bloodraven form to absorb at least a portion of the health he’s lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cyberpunk setting is something new for Ninja Gaiden and a natural evolution from the nighttime cityscapes that the modern trilogy showcased. Industrial grey buildings bathed in a curtain of constant nighttime rain and darker flooring and accents leave the perfect backdrop for the fast-paced combat to pop and not get lost in blurring the two together. While I personally would like to see a return to some of the more rustic landscapes of the Hayabusa Village, I would not be disappointed if the entirety of Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place in these futuristic cities.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 both surprised and delighted me with a challenge that I’ve found to be sorely missing from character action games of recent years. Besting the single boss of the Tokyo Game Show demo on the hardest difficulty available made me appreciate playing a far more aggressive playstyle and how the game allows players to adapt their fighting style differently to each type of enemy or boss. This was my first time getting to see Ninja Gaiden 4 firsthand, and it has already proven itself to be one of my most anticipated action titles of 2025. </p>



<p>The wait to play Ninja Gaiden 4 is nearly over, as the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will launch across Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 21st</a> and will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass for the Ultimate tier.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New World’s Horror-Themed ‘Nighthaven’ Season Looks So Good It Has Players Eager to Dive Back into the MMORPG]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world%E2%80%99s-horror-themed-%E2%80%98nighthaven%E2%80%99-season-looks-so-good-it-has-players-eager-to-dive-back-into-the-mmorpg.1318264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a year since <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>, the relaunch of Amazon's MMORPG that introduced console versions with cross-play and a lot more. The developers were certainly hoping to get a big boost to the active player base, but that didn't quite happen.</p>



<p>However, that might change next week with the upcoming debut of Season 10, which is already garnering a lot of interest among MMO fans. Admittedly, it's not the most exciting time in the genre; sure, there's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-qa-homesteads-new-elite-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2 expansion Visions of Eternity</a> due later this month, and ZeniMax will release the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online, while Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has opened the Alpha test of World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>. But all those games are pretty old (if not very, very old) at this point. The only new MMORPG release of the year will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pax Dei's 1.0</a>, which, unfortunately, does not look like it will be ready for prime time when it comes to polish and features.</p>



<p>Compared to the aforementioned games, New World is undoubtedly much more recent, having launched in September 2021. Some of you will even remember that it was quite popular at first, with Jeff Bezos <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applauding Amazon Game Studios for its first successful release</a>. That did not last due to a severe lack of content, which led players (myself included) to leave in droves.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="New World:  Dev Update - October 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vvYpd_GKLI?start=183&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It took a long time, but the New World development team is slowly getting there, and the new season is very appealing. Nighthaven will introduce an eponymous new zone that, in a lengthy dev diary, was described as the game's largest and most vertical map, contrasting with previous additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-brimstone-sands-update-out-now-adds-a-new-zone-new-weapon-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brimstone Sands</a> (which was horizontal and barren). Visually, it is a love letter to classic horror with macabre, Eastern Europe-inspired aesthetics featuring towering castles, decrepit dungeons, and sweeping pine forests.</p>



<p>Not only does Nighthaven feature more points of interest, lore notes, and quests, it even adds some new interactive exploration and combat mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Chandeliers:</strong> Shoot them to drop on enemies (or risk them falling on you), reinforcing "look up."</li>



<li><strong>Throwables and Flammables:</strong> Use torches or fire staffs to burn spider webs and rat nests, expanding on systems from Cutlass Keys' lightning fields.</li>



<li><strong>Doors and Secrets: </strong>Various doors (bookcase, metal, wooden, magic-locked) lead to hidden areas.</li>



<li><strong>Arcana Tarot System: </strong>Collect 22 major Arcana cards (with Aeternum twists) to unlock tarot towers, elite chests, and caches. Combines with ancient glyphs for puzzles; encourages exploration via jump pads instead of guides.</li>



<li><strong>New Exploration Elements:</strong> Swim through mazes, dodge lasers, use water jets/elevators for vertical traversal.</li>



<li><strong>Jump Pads:</strong> Borrowed from the OPR (Outpost Rush) mode for open-world traversal in the region.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are many horror-inspired creatures, from vampires to werewolves, bats, gargoyles, and even Frankenstein-inspired constructs, and a new story to follow, of course. But the most exciting additions to New World, at least for the long term, are arguably those that seek to expand the endgame.</p>



<p>First and foremost, there will be a new 10-man raid titled Isle of Night. This will be the new toughest PvE challenge in the game, featuring many new enemy types and three boss fights, each with unique mechanics to encourage group coordination. Amazon Game Studios is also adding a Catacombs mode where players venture into a procedurally generated dungeon with a countdown. Through a Catacombs run, they will obtain various power-ups and rewards and have to decide whether to keep going forward or exit before time runs out to retain the rewards. </p>



<p>Progression is getting a big shake-up as well. Level cap is increasing to 70, and the Gear Score is being raised from 725 to 800. Additionally, any Gear with Gear Score of 700 and more will be upgradeable all the way with the new Umbral system.</p>



<p>But there's more: gear can now have up to four empty sockets called Perk Charms, which are roughly split into four categories (offensive, defensive, skill, gems), allowing for greater build customization. Plus, the new gear from PvP, Catacombs, and the Isle of Night raid will feature set bonuses for the first time, making it even more important to get all the pieces in a set.</p>

<p>You need only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1o02qyg/is_new_world_back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go to the MMORPG subreddit</a> to see that there are a lot of positive vibes among MMO fans about Nighthaven (which will go live on October 13 on PC and consoles) and New World as a whole. Could it be the start of a big comeback for Amazon's game? Hopefully, but even greater is the hope that the studio will have learned its lesson ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming The Lord of the Rings MMO they are making</a>.</p>

			<p>Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person according to Forbes, made a big claim yesterday when he <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that the xAI Game Studio would release a 'great' full-scale AI generated videogame by the end of next year.</p>



<p>It was nearly a year ago when Musk, a known videogamer, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1861801046949191686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that xAI, known mainly for the Grok generative AI chatbot, would 'make games great again':</p>



<p><em>Too many game studios that are owned by massive corporations. @xAI is going to start an AI game studio to make games great again!</em></p>



<p>Grok is considered to be one of the top chatbots, but making a full-fledged AI generated game (and a 'great' one at that) seems like a task far beyond the currently available technology to xAI and anyone else, for that matter.</p>



<p>It was just two years ago when NVIDIA's VP of Applied Deep Learning Research Bryan Catanzaro, who can be considered the father of the DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling technology, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-predicts-dlss-10-will-offer-full-neural-rendering-interfaced-with-game-engines-for-much-better-visuals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>I do not believe that AI is gonna build games in a way where you just write a paragraph about making a cyberpunk game and then pop comes out something as good as Cyberpunk 2077. I do think that let's say DLSS 10 in the far future is going to be a completely neural rendering system that interfaces with a game engine in different ways, and because of that, it's going to be more immersive and more beautiful.</em></p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, there have been great advancements in the field of LLMs, but not nearly enough to create a great triple-A game yet, something I'm sure game developers are thankful for. That's not to say it will never happen, and AI will undoubtedly be used more and more in the gaming space, but to speed up and enhance the work of humans, not replace it outright. At least for the foreseeable future.</p>
