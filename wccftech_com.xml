			<p>Peter Connelly, who Tomb Raider fans will recognize as the original composer and sound designer for the series, is now serving 16 months in jail, beginning yesterday, July 17, 2025, for "<em>fraudulently obtaining</em>" a $50,000 (£37,500) loan from the UK government during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Published on the UK government's official website through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud">Insolvency Service</a>, and spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-composer-jailed-for-16-months-after-being-found-guilty-of-fraud">Eurogamer</a>, Connelly was found to have received two loans for his business when businesses were only allowed to receive one. The first was a legitimate loan at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 for £22,000, or $29,500 USD. The second was a month later, for £37,500, or $50,000 USD. Connelly "<em>deliberately inflated</em>" the turnover his company faced in order to secure a larger loan, said David Snasdell, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service.</p>



<p>Connelly claimed that the turnover his company endured amounted to £150,000, though in reality it was a little over £58,000. When being interviewed regarding the loan, he told the Insolvency Service that he "<em>had been given the opportunity to re-imagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack</em>," a project he told them would be very lucrative and significant. He claimed to have taken measures like selling his car to pay for the work, though he later claimed the project had stalled. In August 2021, his company went into liquidation, with neither of the loans he'd taken out having been paid back.</p>



<p>Connelly will be paying back the loans over the course of several payments that will continue while he serves his jail time, and he's also been banned from being the director of a company for the next six years. </p>



<p>"<em>Peter Connelly blatantly disregarded the rules of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, designed to support small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic</em>," Snasdell said. "<em>Connelly not only secured two loans when businesses were only allowed one, but deliberately inflated his company's turnover to receive more money than he was entitled to</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>Connelly isn't the first notable member of the video game industry to be found guilty of financial crimes. Yuji Naka, the co-creator of Sonic, whose last major release was Balan Wonderworld, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-naka-arrested-again-over-insider-trading-relating-to-final-fantasy-vii-the-first-soldier/">was arrested and given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive, the studio currently working on the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake, Jurassic Park Survival, and a currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">unannounced title based on a Hasbro franchise</a>, to name a few, is teasing the reveal of what appears to be another game, and fans believe it to be a Hellraiser-based horror game.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Saber posted a teaser video and a<a href="https://www.july-22-2025.com/"> URL</a> that points to next Tuesday, July 22, 2025, 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST.  Going to the website doesn't show you much, as it is just the date and time for the reveal, appearing as old VHS footage. The teaser posted to YouTube tells us a bit more, with a soundscape that views on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1m2mi55/hellraiser_game_in_development/">Reddit</a> and in the comments of the video believe point to this project potentially being a new Hellraiser game. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Today, Saber posted another video, this time of horror-focused influencers being shown what is presumably the same trailer that we'll all get to see this coming Tuesday. Their reactions describe it as an extremely gore-y game, with one even commenting, "<em>Can you even put stuff like that in a video game?</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We'll see what Tuesday has in store, but the notion of a Hellraiser game is an interesting one. Pinhead, the iconic character from the series, was added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-update-skill-base-matchmaking/">Dead by Daylight</a> in 2021 and was removed from the game <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-pinhead-why-leaving">earlier this year</a> without a completely clear explanation. As far as dedicated Hellraiser games go, there was a Hellraiser game in development in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2354075/">1990 for the NES, set to arrive in 1991</a>, but it never made it to store shelves.</p>



<p>It could be the case that Pinhead was removed from Dead by Daylight to make way for whatever Saber Interactive has planned for Pinhead and the Hellraiser franchise. Or, Saber is teasing something entirely different, and we've all misread the signs to be Hellraiser ones. We'll find out on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>Black Mesa, the well-known remake of the first entry in the Half-Life series developed by Crowbar Collective, looks great with modded path tracing, but it also proves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">once again</a>, how gaming hardware is still not at a point where it can run even older games with full path tracing at high resolutions without upscalers and frame generation.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the game's Remixed mod running with RTX Remix path tracing, highlighting how path tracing, alongside the other improvements featured in the mod, significantly improves visuals, but also completely tanks performance even on a powerful GPU like the RTX 5080. In the side-by-side shots at the beginning of the video, it's highlighted via a performance overlay how the game can go from running in the 200-plus FPS range without path tracing to the high 30s, low-to-mid 40s range with path tracing with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. As such, Frame Generation becomes a necessity to run the game at higher, more playable framerates with path tracing.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Black Mesa Remixed mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-remixed-poc-inbound">ModDB</a>, introduces plenty of improvements to the remake of the first Half-Life game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/">released in 2020</a>. It relights the inbound train ride and parts of the laboratory, and introduces five new meshes including 2K and 4K textures, 10 new meshes that were only present as texture in the original game, 40 to 50 very high quality materials built from the ground up and around 100 materials created from the original colormap using a mixture of techniques and workflows. As such, the mod is worth trying out even without path tracing to experience a small portion of the Half-Life remake like never before.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-v-is-now-available-in-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-nearly-12-years-after-launch.1247271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-realityv-ray-tracing-improvements/">Grand Theft Auto V</a> was initially released on September 17, 2013, and will have officially been out for 12 years this coming September. For hundreds of millions of people around the world, it's been a game they played countless times, or at least have had access to through legal means for the last dozen years. Unless you've spent the last 12 years of your life living in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and didn't try to obtain the game through any under-the-counter means, in which case, Grand Theft Auto V is a brand new release for you in 2025. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online are now available in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and as <a href="https://nikopartners.com/grand-theft-approval-a-turning-point-for-mena-game-regulations/">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad reports</a>, both titles being approved for launch in the regions is a "<em>turning point for MENA game regulations</em>."</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto V getting approval for launch in Saudi Arabia and the UAE also marks the introduction of a new age rating in the region, with the General Authority for Media Regulation in Saudi Arabia and the UAE Media Council introducing a 21+ rating. Grand Theft Auto isn't the only series that hasn't had major releases in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. </p>



<p>The regulatory boards in both regions have previously blocked games based on restrictions that for ratings boards like the ESRB or PEGI would fall under M for Mature/PEGI 18+. The introduction of this new age rating, as Ahmad points out, is what potentially opens the door for those titles that would've previously not made it through. Particularly because under this new rating, Grand Theft Auto V is being allowed to launch "<em>without any major modification</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This is a positive signal for the industry as it potentially allows games to be approved without edits, thereby offering publishers a viable path to market for games that would normally be blocked</em>," Ahmad writes.</p>



<p>So while GTA V and GTA Online getting approval isn't the most significant thing on its own, especially because GTA V has still circulated in the region through unofficial means in the last decade, this new age rating is the thing that has the power to have a drastic impact on the video game industry in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and the rest of the globe. </p>
