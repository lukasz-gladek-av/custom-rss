            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Patch 8.0 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500576552635859479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> today for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, adding several features and new content. The main addition is <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-outlines-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siege Mode</a>, a new PvE mode that expands on the existing Operations mode to include endless enemy waves that can challenge even the strongest teams. When players are overwhelmed, they can call for reinforcements. They'll engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring a different strategy. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing the resources needed to summon either elite Space Marines or the formidable Dreadnought, which can drastically shift the balance of power on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Compared to the build previously available for testing on the Public Test Server, Saber Interactive has reworked the wave timer limit so that, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can become very short on higher waves, there is now a timer for the entire session. Each time players beat a wave, the timer increases.</p>
<p>The developers of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 have also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves, meaning that enemies will become stronger more quickly after the 15th wave. These changes will ensure players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Additionally, the timer may be entirely removed in the future. Moreover, an option has been introduced to disable bot spawning in Private Mode.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 also received some major technical improvements for the PC version. There's now an experimental ray traced ambient occlusion feature (RTAO) that can be toggled on in the graphics settings, and NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is now fully supported, delivering better visuals with the latest transformer model and faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>

<p>There are also many other balance tweaks and additions in the patch. Last but not least, Saber said they are preparing a significant update to the customization system, which will let players reuse chapter champion armor parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping, and technical restrictions). This will be in a future update.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 7 million units sold, and the developers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Space Marine 3.</p>

			<p>A new The First Berserker: Khazan update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing new features, balance, and system changes, and more.</p>
<p>The update, which will go live on PC and consoles later today, introduces AMD FSR 3 and AMD FSR 4 support on AMD Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs. The latest version of the upscaler can be enabled via driver settings with the Adrenalin driver version 25.6.1 or later installed, and will be in use even if the in-game interface says that AMD FSR 3 is instead.</p>
<p>Besides introducing AMD FSR 3 and 4 support on PC, the new The First Berserker: Khazan brings new free DLC for all users, including new armor sets and hairstyles to customize Khazan's appearance, balance adjustments, difficulty changes, augment gear tweaks, interface improvements, and more. The full update notes can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543361383085900258?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam.</a></p>
<p>Though far from being the most original game, I have found The First Berserker: Khazan to be one of the best soulslike games released recently. Combining features from the FromSoftware franchise with mechanics lifted from Team NINJA's games like Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, the game offers a fast-paced, intense experience that's extremely enjoyable to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">review.</a></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square back in 2003, and his departure impacted more than the popular role-playing game series, as Square reportedly "collapsed" after he left.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-collapsed-after-he-left-final-fantasy-composer-on-how-hironobu-sakaguchis-innate-leadership-skills-held-the-company-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Automaton</a>, the creator of the Final Fantasy series recently spoke on the NOBIYO To Isshoni podcast hosted by longtime series composer Nobuo Uematsu about their time together at the Japanese publisher. The creator of one of the most beloved JRPG series was the "big boss" even in the company's early days, and managed to work even at the beginning when Square was more like a club of university students rather than an actual company. At the time, Square did not have a proper corporate organization, Uematsu-san recalled during the show, but everybody listened to Sakaguchi-san, whom he described as a leader. As such, when Sakaguchi-san left Square, the situation was quite bad, and the entire organization suddenly collapsed, so much so that even Uematsu-san felt that he should leave, but the Final Fantasy series ultimately commends Square Enix for getting back on its feet after so many key figures in the company left right before the merger with the Dragon Quest series publisher.</p>
<p>Although Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square over 20 years ago, the legendary game developer recently collaborated with the publisher again on FANTASIAN: Neo Dimension, the PC and console port of the JRPG originally released on the Apple Arcade service a few years back. Sakaguchi-san's touch is unmistakable in the game, so much so that it feels like a proper entry in the Final Fantasy series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fantasian-neo-dimension-final-fantasy-in-all-but-name/">review.</a></p>
