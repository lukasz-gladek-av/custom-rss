			<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft proudly <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Assassin's Creed Shadows has already reached two million players, surpassing the launch of Origins and Odyssey. On release day, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had broken</a> the milestone of one million copies sold.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly a strong start, which the publisher absolutely needed after all the financial disappointments of the last couple of years, between Skull and Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and Star Wars Outlaws, just to name a few. As you already know if you're an avid Wccftech reader, there are strong rumors that the Guillemot brothers, who own the biggest stake in the company, are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-is-seeking-investors-for-new-entity-that-will-hold-the-publishers-biggest-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly seeking investors to create a new entity that would control Ubisoft's largest franchises</a>, starting with Assassin's Creed. A healthy debut for Shadows will most likely help in that regard.</p>
<p>Still, it's too early to tell how successful the game will really end up being. The split between platforms will also be interesting to analyze. The game marks <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's return to big day-one releases on Valve's Steam</a>, the largest PC platform. So far, the concurrent player peak is fairly low (60K), but PC gamers have been used to having to buy the publisher's titles via Ubisoft Connect or the Epic Games Store. It's hard to infer much from this relatively low figure; the PC platform could still make up a sizable portion of that two million user base.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo rated the game 8.7, largely praising Ubisoft Quebec's efforts and the publisher's decision to delay the game:</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>

			<p>Yesterday, Funcom <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546730385827954775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the detailed PC specifications of their upcoming large scale multiplayer survival game Dune Awakening. There's already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a benchmark (with character creator) available on Steam</a> to test out the expected performance, but these specs will be welcome nonetheless, especially since they anticipate a reasonably optimized game despite the usage of Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> that the game would support NVIDIA DLSS 4, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. Now, Funcom has confirmed that Dune Awakening will also integrate 'the latest open upscaling and advanced frame generation tech from AMD', which would appear to hint at AMD FSR 3 support (FSR 4 is exclusive to the new AMD GPUs) as well as Intel XeSS 2 with XeLL to lower latency.</p>
<p>Additionally, thanks to a partnership with Razer, Dune Awakening integrates Razer Chroma RGB and Razer Sensa HD Haptics, enhancing immersion. The Razer Kraken V4 Pro headset provides synced lighting and intelligent haptic feedback, just like the Freyja Gaming Cushion, which will let you feel the hum of your ornithopter as if you were sitting on it.</p>
<p>The following tweakable settings were confirmed, too:</p>
<p><b>Settings</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Remappable keyboard &amp; mouse controls</li>
<li>Better support for AZERTY/QWERTZ and ESDF users</li>
<li>Subtitles on/off</li>

<li>Optional chat indicators or chat bubbles in social areas</li>
<li>Optional loadout hotbar, mini-radial or radial wheel</li>

<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening â€” Business Model &amp; Post-Launch Plans Explained" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1B7G2SXBDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Game Director Joel Bylos spoke in a brief video about the business model ahead of the pre-order opening. Dune Awakening will be buy-to-play only, so there won't be any optional subscriptions. Bylos stressed that this won't be an early access launch. That said, Funcom has a long history of supporting games like its MMOs (Anarchy Online is still active 25 years later) and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-age-of-heroes-begins-today-adding-voiced-companions-and-living-player-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Exiles</a>, and the same will happen with this one through a combination of free updates and optional premium DLCs.</p>
<p>There will also be optional Season Passes, which include several DLCs, but the DLCs will also be purchasable separately. Finally, as with most games, there will be five days of advanced access for those who purchase the most expensive editions. Bylos noted that this, however, helps the studio balance server load, ensuring a better experience for everyone. Furthermore, when the game launches for everyone, there will be new servers for those who don't wish to join a server where others have already started progressing.</p>
<p>For our interview with Joel Bylos at a recent event, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-roundtable-qa-privately-hosted-servers-are-under-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to this article</a>. Dune Awakening is out in less than two months on PC, while the console versions will be released at a later date.</p>
