			<p>Bloober Team, the development studio behind the excellent Silent Hill 2 remake, confirmed its collaboration with Konami will continue with a new game that is currently in development.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on its<a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website</a>, the Polish development team confirmed they are continuing their partnership with Konami, announcing the signing of a new agreement for a joint project. This new project is based on an unspecified Konami IP. Like with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami will once again be the new game's publisher and rights holder.</p>
<p>While neither the Silent Hill 2 remake developer nor Konami has added any hint as to which IP the new project will be based on, as Bloober Team is known to be a horror games developer, there's a very good chance the Polish studio will be working on the series again. While a remake of the iconic first entry in the series would be quite welcome by many, myself included, it would also be interesting to see what Bloober would do with the franchise if given the freedom to develop a new entry in the series.</p>
<p>No matter what Bloober Team will do, the studio has proved it has what it takes to create an extremely compelling horror experience with the Silent Hill 2 remake. You can learn more about the game now out on PC and PlayStation 5 by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review.</a></p>

			<p><span>Yesterday, during the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8FrLCDS3hY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase, </a>which was held in partnership with IGN, Microsoft unveiled several news tidbits from third-party developers.</span></p>
<p>Arguably, the most important was the announcement of the release date for Revenge of the Savage Planet. This is the sequel to Journey to 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, which earned a positive reception, including an <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10 score here on Wccftech</a> from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Anybody pining for more Metroid Prime needs to put Journey to the Savage Planet at the top of their list. The game has a few rough edges and its sense of humor might not be to all tastes, but it captures that inviting, adventuresome Metroid spirit better than anything Iâ€™ve played in a while. This Savage Planet will pull you into its orbit if you give it half a chanc</em>e.</p>
<p>However, getting a sequel going wasn't easy at all for the developers. Typhoon Studios was acquired by Google shortly prior to the game's release, but in early 2021, following Google's divestiture from its Stadia initiative, the studio was shut down alongside others. Later that year, former members of Typhoon, including Game Director and Writer Alex Hutchinson, established a new developer called Raccoon Logic and were able to secure the rights from Google to produce a sequel. Revenge of the Savage Planet launches on May 8 for Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC, and will be included with Game Pass on day one.</p>

<p>Another big news story from the ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase was the new trailer for Lies of P: Overture, the highly anticipated DLC for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed Soulslike game</a>. In this expansion, players encounter a mysterious artifact that transports them back to Krat in its final days of grandeur. In the shadow of an impending tragedy, their mission is to explore the past and uncover its dark secrets, haunted by surprises, loss, and vengeance. The developer says the choices made will ripple through the past and present in the world of Lies of P, revealing hidden truths and leaving lasting consequences. Lies of P: Overture <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch this Summer</a>.</p>
