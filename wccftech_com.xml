			<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1864846226392588539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has already sold two million copies between retail and digital. Given that the game launched less than a month ago, it's a great result for the Japanese publisher.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Kai Tatsumoto rated the remake 8.6 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been given a complete graphical overhaul, instead giving the iconic RPG a makeover in the same vein as Square-Enix’s Octopath Traveler and other similar titles. The entire world is brightly colored and blooming with light. Even if you’re intimately familiar with every step retracing Ortega’s journey, the complete reimagining of the adventure makes this feel like a brand new adventure rather than just another release of Seeds of Salvation. All I can say now is that I can’t wait to go through Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake next year.</em></p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D, while not the definitive edition that includes all of the previous side content, embodies the perfect version of Erdrick's adventure that both old and new fans can appreciate as if a brand new adventure from Yuji Horii.</em></p>

			<p>Among the many new game announcements featured in yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025, Deepest Fear certainly stands out as one of the most intriguing.&nbsp;It is being developed by Variable State, a British independent studio known for games like Virginia, Last Stop, and the upcoming Polaris.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Deepest Fear is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter game featuring inspirations from the likes of James Cameron, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Paul Verhoven in terms of atmosphere. On the other hand, Metroid Prime, Half-Life 2, System Shock 2, and Dead Space were cited as inspirations for the gameplay, which is said to mix Metroidvania design with immersive simulation elements, allowing the player to come up with interesting solutions to the various situations presented throughout the game.</p>
<p>There's also a particular twist in that Deepest Fear features a full-fledged real-time fluid simulation, which protagonist Dr. Danni Carrol will use to fight otherworldly entities that manifest spontaneously from any water source. Moreover, the surrounding environment can flood and take in water at any moment, sweeping her away with unpredictable currents and plunging the protagonist into the suffocating depths.</p>

			<p>Today, CCP Games announced Founder Access for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, which gives those who purchased it the opportunity to have a say on features within the space survival simulation game while also being given access to the in-development build of the game on a continuous basis. This access begins on December 10, when those who hold the Founder Access pass will be able to join the exclusive, always-on server in Closed Alpha. This gives them the opportunity to provide crucial feedback to the developers and leave their mark on the game before it is released.</p>
<p>Releasing Founder Access marks the start of the next phase of development of EVE Frontier by allowing those who have purchased the pass to access it permanent pre-launch access. By doing this, it means that players will be able to play and experience EVE Frontier before it has launched and will be able to give feedback to the developers on features that may need tweaking or adding or even bug fixes that CCP Games may have missed. Of course, that is not the only thing that players can get by purchasing Founder Access. Players will also get additional benefits, such as name reservations, cosmetics, Discord roles, and special access to CCP Games Developer streams. Additionally, when the game launches in the future as free-to-play, Founders will be able to redeem their included premium subscription time.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVE Frontier | Official 'First Look'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sOVGHEyCnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>CCP Games CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson said:</p>
<p><em>In EVE Frontier we are deepening the contribution and connection players have over a living galaxy. A virtual world where developers and players are equals, where the rules apply to all. Our long-term vision is to create an open ecosystem built, operated, and governed by the Frontier's inhabitants themselves.</em></p>
<p>From today, those interested will be able to purchase Founder Access to EVE Frontier, with three different tiers to purchase. The cheapest tier is $29.99 and includes a Unique Awakened Portrait and one month of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time. The second tier, named Initiated, is $59.99, including two exclusive skins, a portrait, two months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, and a 24-hour early start at launch.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the third tier, which is the most expensive and provides the most benefits. This comes with a unique Ascended Portrait and three exclusive skins. You'll also get four months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, a Name Reservation, and a 72-hour early start at launch. To get all of these benefits, you'll have to pay $89.99.</p>
