			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-publisher-promises-fix-clans-locked-day-one-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, Paradox Interactive admitted its original mistake and announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will include all playable vampire clans in the base version. At Gamescom 2025, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the Toreador and Lasombra clans would only be available as part of the Premium Edition or, separately, through a $21.99 DLC. Needless to say, this caused a massive backlash from fans, eventually forcing Paradox to rework the plan.</p>



<p>Marco Behrmann, White Wolf Executive Vice President and Bloodlines 2 Executive Producer, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing. We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.</em></p>

<p>Now, the Premium Edition will include, in addition to the already announced Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack that hearkens back to the original game, two upcoming story DLCs. The first, titled Loose Cannon, follows Brujah Sheriff Benny's brutal perspective, letting players experience his story of relentless pursuit. When Loose Cannon launches, players with the Premium Edition will also unlock a Benny-inspired outfit for Phyre. Loose Cannon launches in Q2 2026 and can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99. The second DLC is called The Flower &amp; the Flame and follows Toreador Primogen Ysabella’s legendary path to creating her dark magnum opus. Players who own The Flower &amp; the Flame will also get a Ysabella-inspired outfit for Phyre when the story pack launches. The Flower &amp; the Flame launches in Q3 2026 and can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99. The Expansion Pass can be purchased separately on October 21, 2025, for $34.99/£28.99/€34.99.</p>

<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will also offer a physical Premium Edition priced at $89.99/£74.99/€89.99. Created with PLAION, it will include the Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox pre-order bonus, the Expansion Pass, five character cards, a journal, and a Steelbook case, all packaged in a premium box.</p>

			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-netflix-anime-series/">2020</a>, we learned that Ubisoft was teaming up with Netflix to produce an animated Splinter Cell TV series adaptation. Now, five years later, that adaptation, titled Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, will finally premiere this coming October 14, 2025. But as far as a new game in the series is concerned, or even when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/">previously announced remake is coming</a>? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>



<p>Netflix debuted the first official trailer for Splinter Cell: Deathwatch yesterday, alongside its release date, featuring an older Sam Fisher getting back into his three-eyed night vision goggles alongside a new Splinter Cell agent for a new generation, Zinnia McKenna. Fisher is being voiced by Liev Schreiber instead of his original voice actor, Michael Ironside, while McKenna is played by Kirby Howell-Baptiste.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The story of Deathwatch follows Fisher getting back into the fight thanks to a personal connection, after McKenna seeks his help. A larger plot unfolds, and a much older Fisher than the one we knew in the core games finds himself back in the thick of it.</p>



<p>It seems like a fairly solid foundation for an interesting story, but that's not all fans of the Splinter Cell franchise are looking for. A new animated show is great, but everyone is waiting on a new game.</p>



<p>Stealth games like the original Splinter Cell series are few and far between nowadays, and a new game in the series is well overdue. Hopefully, we'll actually hear something about a new game in the series within the next year, or at the very least the coming remake, if we're not going to get a brand new entry in the series.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Splinter Cell fans who are taking whatever morsels of information they can, can try to tide themselves over with the coming animated series.</p>
