			<p>Last night, we saw a lot of amazing announcements at The Game Awards, with some truly fantastic moments and surprises. The iconic <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-developer-hazelight-studios-next-game-split-fiction-leaks-online/">Josef Fares</a> made his way onto the stage to announce his latest game, Split Fiction. The title of this game was already sussed out on the internet just a few days prior. Electronic Arts and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hazelight Studios</a> have teamed up to release a brand-new co-op title, which will be set to release on March 6, 2025. For those unfamiliar, Hazelight Studios are the masterminds behind It Takes Two, a title that has sold more than 20 million units worldwide and helped further the co-op genre. It Takes Two was also Game of the Year winner in 2021. This title shares some similarities to It Takes Two but comes with a sci-fi and fantasy twist to it.</p>
<p>In Split Fiction, players assume the roles of Mio and Zoe, where you have to work together to get your creative legacies back while also finding joy and love in an unexpected friendship. If you haven't seen the reveal trailer, make sure to check it out below. It has some really great comedic moments and showcases some of the gameplay mechanics you can expect from the upcoming title.</p>

<p>"At Hazelight, we've been building co-op games for 10 years, and with every game we push beyond what players expect for action-adventure co-op games. I'm so proud of what we have built with Split Fiction. Let me tell you guys, it's going to blow your mind," says Josef Fares, Founder of Hazelight Studios. "Because Mio and Zoe jump back and forth between sci-fi and fantasy worlds, we've been able to do some really wild things with gameplay and storytelling. This is definitely our most epic co-op adventure yet."</p>
<p>In Split Fiction, you'll get to experiment with lots of fun mechanics and abilities as you cross between sci-fi and fantasy worlds. This includes challenging a monkey to a dance battle, being a pig on a trampoline, and getting to do some cool tricks on a hoverboard. It's the cross-over between fun and silly, and it is full of ambition. It looks like it'll be enjoyable for all ages.</p>
<p>"Friendships and great memories are made through playing amazing co-op games together - and no one does it better than Hazelight. We're excited to continue our long-term partnership with Josef and his talented team to bring another innovative, collaborative adventure to life; one that continues to push the boundaries and redefine what players can experience together on and off the screen," says Jeff Gamon, General Manager of EA Partners.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will be released on March 6, 2025, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA app for $49.99.</p>

			<p>Last night, The Game Awards took place, where audiences all over the world tuned in to watch some world-first announcements and awards be handed out to winners across multiple categories. One of the announcements that came out last night was a new trailer with a release window for Dying Light: The Beast. It showed off some more gameplay and set the scene of the game while introducing the Baron, a crucial character in the story who was responsible for the imprisonment of <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/">Kyle Crane</a>. In the event you missed the trailer last night, you can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast â€” MEET THE BARON - THE GAME AWARDS 2024 TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Tkwem4M1uw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Baron is a cruel, emotionless husk but is a fantastic scientist and is good at what he does. He is the biggest threat to Kyle Crane, as he is the man who was responsible for experimenting on Kyle Crane for over a decade, causing his rage and thirst for revenge against this man. Thanks to the experiments carried out on Crane, he now has beastlike powers, which make him incredibly strong and help him survive in an incredibly dangerous world.</p>
<p>Kyle Crane also has to deal with juggling his intense hatred and rage towards the Baron in Dying Light: The Beast and also making sure that he doesn't step out of line and risk the lives of the survivors and factions in Castor Woods. As a result, he has to work to keep the people in Castor Woods safe while keeping his true feelings at bay.</p>
<p>With the use of beastlike powers, Kyle Crane gets to take part in some truly disgusting and intense combat while utilizing the environment around him, allowing for snappy movement and parkour, making it easy for you to navigate the various terrain types through the game, which includes forests, Swamps, cities and more.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast has already reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,000,000 wishlists</a> in less than 10 weeks, which is a testimony of the dedicated fanbase and community for this game, with Techland expressing their gratitude.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast doesn't have a specific set date for when it will be released just yet, but the game is set to release sometime in the Summer of 2025. For those interested, the game will be available to play on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Dying Light: The Beast?</p>
