			<p>Big changes are rumored to be on the horizon for Xbox Game Pass, including changes to PC Game Pass, a price increase for the Ultimate subscription and cheaper, ad-supported tiers.</p>



<p>The rumors originated on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-big-changes-to-gamepass-including-a-free-cheaper-tier-with-ads.1313263/">ResetERA forums</a> from moderator Slayven, who claimed to have information from an unspecified source that has proved reliable in the past. The timing for all these changes is unclear, although some are reportedly coming next year.</p>



<p>The first big change will be the sunsetting of PC Game Pass, presumably leaving the Ultimate tier as the only way to access the Game Pass library on PC. The price of the Ultimate tier is reportedly increasing to $25 in the United States, although the timing is uncertain, as this price increase could be delayed to 2026.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass Core and Standard subscription tiers are reportedly not getting any major change. The two subscription tiers are rumored to be renamed to Game Pass Essential and Game Pass Premium, mirroring the naming for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-plus-to-launch-this-june-premium-subscription-to-give-access-to-classic-ps3-ps2-ps1-and-psp-games/">PlayStation Plus subscription tiers</a>, which sounds like a good marketing move.</p>



<p>The biggest change to Xbox Game Pass, reportedly coming in 2026, however, is the addition of an ad-supported subscription tier. This tier, which could also be offered for free, will be time-based with forced ads.</p>



<p>As there's no way to verify the information revealed in today's report, we have to take these Xbox Game Pass changes with a massive grain of salt. Considering how the gaming market continues to change, however, and how Microsoft has been making changes to the service in recent times, there's a solid chance that something may indeed be brewing as today's rumors suggest.</p>



<p>Discussion regarding Xbox Game Pass has always been heated since the service's launch in 2017, as if these changes are indeed coming, it will only get more heated. Although Microsoft has never disclosed the performance of the service, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-factor-first-party/">it reportedly seems to have been doing well</a>. As such, it's no surprise the company will continue to focus on it for the foreseeable future, as head of Xbox's ID@Xbox program, Chris Charla, confirmed not only that the service is popular among partners, but also that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">2025 has marked the company's largest investment in Game Pass to date.</a></p>



<p>More information on Xbox Game Pass, its subscription tiers and the current game library can be found on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games">service's official website.</a></p>

			<p>The Witcher creator Andrzej Sapkowski never really hid his utter disdain for gaming in general. This was perhaps only exacerbated by the famous dispute with Polish developer CD Projekt RED: originally, the author sold the videogaming rights for a relative pittance, thinking they would never really be that successful. </p>



<p>Following The Witcher III: Wild Hunt's immense success, however, Sapkowski <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-author-million-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded $16 million in royalty payments</a> despite the fact that the deal they had previously struck did not mention any royalty fees at all. Eventually, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a new agreement with the creator of The Witcher</a> that purportedly satisfied both parties.</p>



<p>Now, though, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh Reddit AMA on the Fantasy subreddit</a>, Sapkowski returned to criticize CD Projekt's games, specifically on their 'completely unnecessary' expansion of the concept of Witcher schools. Here's the relevant quote:  </p>



<p><em>The issue of "witcher schools" requires—I apologise—a longer explanation. A single sentence about some "school of the Wolf" mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never. However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these "witcher schools." Completely unnecessary.</em></p>



<p><em>I'm still uncertain about what to do with this situation. Perhaps, taking the path of least resistance, I'll erase the sentence about the "school" from future editions of The Last Wish. Or maybe I'll want to expand and clarify the matter somehow in subsequent books? Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit.</em></p>



<p>It is quite obvious that Sapkowski never played CD Projekt's The Witcher games, as their schools are really nothing like Harry Potter's Houses. Anyway, the writer later replied to a question about adaptations in general, once again claiming the inherent superiority of the written word to images, 'animated or otherwise':</p>



<p><em>Regardless of the quality of these adaptations, there are no dependencies or points of convergence between the literary original and its adaptation. The original stands alone, and every adaptation stands alone; you can't translate words into images without losing something, and there can't be any connections here. Moreover, adaptations are mostly visualisations, which means transforming written words into images, and there is no need to prove the superiority of the written word over images, it is obvious. The written word always and decidedly triumphs over images, and no picture - animated or otherwise - can match the power of the written word.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Sapkowski is entitled to his opinion, though it clearly appears to stem from a strong bias. For its part, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still plans to incorporate some concepts from the author's latest book</a>, Crossroads of Ravens, in the upcoming game The Witcher IV (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't be released before 2027</a>).</p>
