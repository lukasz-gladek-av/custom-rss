			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software is pushing toward a far larger, seamless world, and that factored into the developer's decision to drop the minimap seen in previous installments.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAX East 2025 panel</a>, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford explained:</p>
<p><em>This is the biggest (by far) universe that we've built, and it's seamless. There's no load times. You see something anywhere on the screen, a mile away up in the sky, and you will be able to get there. We made a big freaking world. And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there, and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities, several at the same time, that might be miles away. A compass really helps us do that.</em></p>
<p>The other aspect that played into Gearbox's choice is that Borderlands 4 will be much more vertical than its predecessor. Pitchford added:</p>
<p><em>The other thing that the team really wanted to commit to is to push the boundaries of design and environment. Instead of just a single flat plane, they embraced a lot of verticality. You're going to have more verticality in Borderlands 4 than you've ever seen before in a Borderlands game by far, and when you have a layered environment, a top-down two-dimensional view is extremely confusing. With a compass with arrows that tell you if things are up or down, you have a much better sense of spatial awareness, and we want you to play the game, not the map. So, we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system.</em></p>
<p><em>You still have the big map. It's one click away and we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have an AI-driven kind of navigation system that'll give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go, and there's even an in-world companion, Echobot, that has some features there that'll help you navigate.</em></p>
<p>Pitchford didn't rule out adding a minimap to Borderlands 4 at some point in the future (presumably after launch), but told fans to play the game first before judging.&nbsp;That'll happen <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on September 12</a>, when the game is planned to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will release later, and Pitchford talked about that, too, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our previous report</a>.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has confirmed that for Nintendo-developed, first-party games for the Nintendo Switch 2, like Mario or Zelda games, the company has "<em>no plans</em>" to release game-key card versions.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">Nintendo Life</a>, Nintendo confirmed that game-key card versions of its first-party developed games are not something it is looking to do. "<em>We have no plans to use game-key cards for Nintendo-developed titles.</em>"</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-has-great-optimism-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-but-wont-necessarily-bring-all-games-to-the-platform/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is weeks away from launch at the time of writing, and while there's plenty of excitement, there are still plenty of questions and anxieties about how all the changes coming with the console will land.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/">Game-key cards</a> are one of the changes that players aren't happy about. If you didn't know, Game-key cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 are physical cartridges you can buy in your local video game store or online, just as you would any physical copy of a game, but they are not, in any way, a copy of the game you're buying. There's no game data on them; they're just a key, and the game you're buying will be installed on your console through a digital download.</p>
<p>We've seen that before with PlayStation and Xbox game discs, and with some Nintendo Switch games that have a limited amount of the game's data on the cartridge, with the rest downloaded. But that isn't stopping players from being upset in a whole new way about game-key cards.</p>
<p>At least, for now, we can expect that games like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and whatever the next 3D Mario game is will all be released as proper physical editions, where the game is on the cartridge you buy in a store or online instead of just a key for a digital download.</p>
<p>Of course, the stipulation that Nintendo has no plans to do this for titles that Nintendo develops means that any Nintendo-published titles could still be released as game-key card versions. We should also expect plenty of third-party studios to go the game-key card route instead of spending the extra money to release proper cartridges.</p>
