			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of La Quimera, a new sci-fi first-person shooter in development at Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine), 4A Games (the Malta office) decided to <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> a brief explanation to those in the community who might still be confused.</p>
<p>As we explained in last week's news, the two studios are entirely separate now, and the Maltan developer, who is now the only one to carry the revered name, has confirmed to be working on the next Metro installment with franchise creator Dmitry Glukhovsky.</p>
<p><em>We are the team that created and built the Metro games you know and love. We’re still making the next Metro with Dmitry Glukhovsky, the same core founders, leadership, developers, and nearly 20 years experience on the series. We also have our other new IP project in the works. We’ll reveal more about both when we’re ready.</em></p>
<p><em>We are proudly Ukrainian in our roots, and in the majority of our diverse team. We make games from our offices in Kyiv and Sliema, as well as remotely, and even sometimes from the front line in Ukraine. We now have studios in two countries, but the majority of our team remain in Ukraine - roughly 150 out of about 200+. The rest work in Malta, or remotely.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2014, we, led by the original "four A's" - the founders of 4A Games - formed “4A Games Limited” and created a new HQ in Malta with roughly 50 of our fellow team members. We have since grown and work to this day on Metro under contract with Deep Silver and Plaion.</em></p>
<p><em>We continued to work closely with our remaining Ukrainian colleagues at “4A Games Ukraine” on Metro Exodus through an outsource relationship led by us. Once Metro Exodus and its DLC was released, we created another Kyiv studio under 4A Games Limited and welcomed roughly 50 more of our colleagues to continue on with us, while 4A Games Ukraine continued to pursue their own project La Quimera, as a completely separate entity and recently renamed themselves Reburn. We wish them every success.</em></p>
<p><em>The 4A Games you know and love have not changed, and we are not rebranding. We are the same developers of Metro that brought you Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light, Metro Redux, and Metro Exodus.</em></p>
<p>It's been a long time since the last mainline entry in the post-apocalyptic franchise. Exodus <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched over six years ago</a>, after all. Sure, there have been the DLCs and other post-launch drops, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-enhanced-edition-impressions-4a-games-delivers-the-most-advanced-lighting-yet-without-sacrificing-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enhanced Edition</a> and the mod tools, but the fans are eager to get back into the world envisioned by Dmitry Glukhovsky - and the recently released VR-only game <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Awakening</a> (developed by Vertigo Games) certainly didn't sate them.</p>
<p>4A Games owner THQ Nordic (now Embracer Group) first <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-metro-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new Metro game in August 2019. Since then, the studio has been awfully quiet, although they did <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> about a year ago that the next game is coming in '202X'. Industry rumors have previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sequel-reportedly-fully-playable-could-be-revealed-later-this-year-for-2024-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> the game to have been fully playable as early as February 2023, so perhaps they'll surprise with a launch in late 2025 or early 2026.</p>

			<p>This news was announced at the IGN Fan Fest, where publisher tinyBuild games and developer Hologryph said that the highly anticipated PvPvE extraction shooter SAND, would be getting an Early Access release date of April 3, 2025.</p>
<p>Players were first introduced to SAND and the difficulty of the intense game with a demo that was showcased during <a href="https://wccftech.com/sands-steam-next-fest-demo-available-now/">Steam Next Fest</a> last year and was so popular that it ranked among the top ten most played demos. Additionally, last month saw an open playtest for SAND, with over 200,000 testers participating.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen what SAND is all about, make sure to check out this trailer below, which showcases the Tramplers you'll get to pilot, as well as some of the high-octane combat you'll get to take part in.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAND | Release Date Reveal | Action-packed Multiplayer Mech Action" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rvIyS0eIlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In SAND, you are thrown into an alternate history of 1910 with an industrial spin. In this game, you'll get to experience first-person PvPvE combat, where you can choose to play on your own or with a group of friends, where you can then take on other players in the dunes of Sophie, an area that was once filled with resources but now lays barren and desolate.</p>
<p>Not only will you get to pilot the Tramplers, which are your gigantic walking bases. Here, you will be able to store any resources that you plunder, as well as hide here to get protection from the intense elements, as well as get to utilize it in battle. You can choose the size, the layout, the placement of its engine and compartments, as well as what weapons you equip on your Trampler.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1431300/Sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for SAND, the developers are estimating that the title will be in Early Access for around a year based on the roadmap and developmental goals. This game has been in the works since 2023, where the game has built up a dedicated community that has participated in multiple playtests and demos to provide valuable feedback to the team.</p>
<p>When asked how the full version will differ from the Early Access version, the developers have stated the following:</p>
<p>"<em>SAND is expected to evolve and grow significantly over the course of Early Access, with new weapons, Trampler compartments, islands/POIs, PvE mechanics, crafting mechanics, cosmetic options, world hazards, visual improvements, optimization and more already either under discussion or in active development."I</em></p>
