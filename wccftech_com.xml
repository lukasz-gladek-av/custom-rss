			<p>French game publisher and developer Microids has unveiled Syberia Remastered, a 'fully modernized' version of the classic point-and-click adventure game originally released in 2002. The game is scheduled to launch in the last quarter of 2025 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660220/Syberia__Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>Microids Studio Paris is working with Studio Virtuallyz on the project to remake not only the visuals but also tweak the puzzles and update the UI and controls, as detailed below in the official Syberia Remastered overview.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Meet Syberia’s iconic characters fully redesigned and explore the game’s most emblematic locations brought to life in beautifully enhanced 3D. Every environment has been carefully rebuilt with an art direction that stays true to Benoît Sokal’s unique style, offering an even deeper immersion into his singular visual universe.</em></li>
<li><em>Enjoy a fresh take on the game’s intricate puzzles, redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience while preserving their essential role in uncovering the secrets behind Voralberg’s genius.</em></li>
<li><em>Rediscover Kate Walker’s journey with an updated user interface, improved 3D navigation, and more fluid controls tailored to today’s standards, all without compromising the game’s contemplative and narrative soul.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the story, protagonist Kate Walker, a brilliant New York lawyer, is sent to a remote village in the French Alps to conclude the sale of an old automaton factory. However, what seemed like a routine assignment soon turns into an extraordinary journey across Eastern Europe and its snow-covered landscapes.</p>
<p>Kate is accompanied by Oscar, a loyal and unique automaton. The duo embarks on an adventure to discover mysterious and forgotten places filled with eccentric characters. She ends up following the trail of Hans Voralberg, a genius inventor pursuing an impossible dream: to find the last living mammoths on the mythical island of Syberia.</p>
<p>Syberia Remastered isn't the first remake released this year by Microids. They also launched Amerzone - The Explorer's Legacy just a couple of weeks ago; Amerzone is set in the same universe as the Syberia games.</p>
<p>The most recent new installment in the franchise is Syberia: The World Before, which launched in 2022. The game earned a positive 7.5/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/syberia-the-world-before-review-a-return-to-form/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Syberia - The World Before is a return to form for the series, and an all-around solid adventure game featuring an engaging story that nicely blends together two different timelines, charming characters and good puzzle design. The experience, however, leaves something to be desired when it comes to innovation, making the game a must-buy only for fans of the series.</em></p>

			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software is pushing toward a far larger, seamless world, and that factored into the developer's decision to drop the minimap seen in previous installments.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAX East 2025 panel</a>, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford explained:</p>
<p><em>This is the biggest (by far) universe that we've built, and it's seamless. There's no load times. You see something anywhere on the screen, a mile away up in the sky, and you will be able to get there. We made a big freaking world. And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there, and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities, several at the same time, that might be miles away. A compass really helps us do that.</em></p>
<p>The other aspect that played into Gearbox's choice is that Borderlands 4 will be much more vertical than its predecessor. Pitchford added:</p>
<p><em>The other thing that the team really wanted to commit to is to push the boundaries of design and environment. Instead of just a single flat plane, they embraced a lot of verticality. You're going to have more verticality in Borderlands 4 than you've ever seen before in a Borderlands game by far, and when you have a layered environment, a top-down two-dimensional view is extremely confusing. With a compass with arrows that tell you if things are up or down, you have a much better sense of spatial awareness, and we want you to play the game, not the map. So, we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system.</em></p>
<p><em>You still have the big map. It's one click away and we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have an AI-driven kind of navigation system that'll give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go, and there's even an in-world companion, Echobot, that has some features there that'll help you navigate.</em></p>
<p>Pitchford didn't rule out adding a minimap to Borderlands 4 at some point in the future (presumably after launch), but told fans to play the game first before judging.&nbsp;That'll happen <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on September 12</a>, when the game is planned to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will release later, and Pitchford talked about that, too, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our previous report</a>.</p>
