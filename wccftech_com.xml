			<p>Sony and San Diego Studio are bringing MLB The Show to iOS and Android devices with MLB The Show Mobile. Published by Sony and developed by San Diego Studios, it's already available, though only in the Philippines. It's getting a limited regional release to start, and will roll out globally as development on the game expands.</p>



<p>The free-to-play mobile game will be "<em>a new standalone experience built from the ground up to deliver realistic baseball gameplay on mobile devices</em>," <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/">according to the game's website</a>. If you're keen to swing for the fences with MLB The Show Mobile but you don't live in the Philippines, you can sign up on the website to receive an email when it is available in your region.</p>



<p>The trailer showcases a bit of gameplay and the touch-control-optimized user interface. It also shows a bit of the card system, where players will be able to collect cards and create their all-star team, which will also likely be where the game makes its money.</p>

<p>This is the latest mobile venture for Sony, and it's arguably the one that makes the most sense. Baseball lends itself to mobile devices better than other sports and definitely better than some of the other intellectual properties in Sony's portfolio. It's also the latest platform expansion for MLB The Show, which was the first PlayStation exclusive title <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-early-march-2024-mlb-the-show-24-control/">to make the jump over to Xbox </a>after the MLB forced the issue to make it happen. </p>



<p>The limited regional release is perhaps the most interesting aspect of this. It feels like Sony and San Diego Studio are trying to take their time before bringing it elsewhere, like the United States, which is, of course, a significant chunk of the baseball market. Though this could just be a quick test ahead of a global launch that'll <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/06/goal-setting-mlb-the-show-26/">coincide with the release of MLB The Show 26</a>, which will arrive somewhere in its regular window of early 2026.</p>
