			<p>The recently released Steam Deck native build of Baldur's Gate 3 introduces noticeable performance improvements where they matter most, although it is not possible to currently judge how much performance is improved with actual data due to benchmarking tools not being available with this build, according to a new video shared online.</p>



<p>The new video focused on the new build of the cRPG developed by Larian Studio and shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a> highlights how the new native build of the game feels smoother in Act 3. This area is known to be extremely demanding and struggles to run smoothly on every platform, and the footage shown during the video definitely suggests that performance has indeed been improved in some capacity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to know how much performance is improved in the new build because benchmarking tools are unavailable without the Proton compatibility layer. This also prevents users from <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">enabling AMD FSR 4 for better image quality</a>, although Lossless Scaling appears to work even without the compatibility layer, so an upscaling option is still available those who want to enjoy the game with this build.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though the most significant new addition, the native Steam Deck build is only one of the new features introduced in Baldur's Gate 3 by Hotfix #34. The other improvements and fixes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940?emclan=103582791464711919&amp;emgid=511843343389426278">outlined in the official update notes</a> are stability improvements on Xbox consoles, gameplay and audio fixes, and much more.</p>



<p>Considering how long Baldur's Gate 3 is, improving the Steam Deck handheld experience with a native build is highly welcome, allowing more users to experience one of the best cRPGs released in recent times. No matter the platform on which it is played, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game more than worthy of experiencing, in my opinion, thanks to an engaging story, a charming cast of characters, and deep role-playing game mechanics, which make for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">a great adaptation of the D&amp;D 5e ruleset</a>.</p>

			<p>Riot Games has announced the launch date for the early access version of 2XKO, its long-awaited fighting game. 2XKO will open its gates to all PC players on October 7, just as the currently ongoing Closed Beta ends. </p>



<p>The developers said the newest playable characters, Vi and Blitzcrank, have been quickly adopted by the fans, who have also already organized many community tournaments during this Closed Beta test. Meanwhile, Riot has been tuning matchmaking and fixing bugs, and they reckon everything has held up well enough so far, giving them the proverbial green light for the next step.</p>



<p>The early access version will add Combo Trials, a full season worth of content, and also permanent unlocks; that is to say, there will be no more resets from October 7 onward.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There will be five seasons in 2026, each adding a new champion, Ranked reset, Battle Pass, and more. This means that 2XKO's tenth champion will be released when Early Access goes live on October 7. A dedicated gameplay reveal trailer and developer update are coming soon.</p>



<p>Being a Riot game, it's no surprise that they already have a plan for the competitive scene. To begin with, the developer is sponsoring 22 community-run tournaments in 2025 as part of the so-called First Impact Program. Each First Impact event, starting with EVO France (October 10-12), will receive a bonus from Riot, and there will be an additional prize for winning as a duo. </p>



<p>2XKO has long been known as Project L, a game spearheaded by the Cannon brothers, former developers of the fighting game Rising Thunder. The project got its final name in February 2024, when Riot also <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a 2025 release window for both PC and consoles</a>. It looks like they didn't quite make it in time for consoles, which won't be a part of this early access debut.</p>



<p>2XKO is a free 2v2 fighting game featuring iconic League of Legends champions. Players can team up with or against friends for explosive showdowns, and master a variety of unique tag and assist mechanics to defeat the enemy duo.</p>
