			<p>2024 was a year to remember for roleplaying games, and 2025 is looking to be no different. Whether you are looking into getting into a new series featuring a brand-new world, returning to a well-known universe, experiencing a well-known universe from another perspective, or enjoying a classic game with improved visuals and new quality-of-life features, the next 12 months will not fail to provide exactly what you are looking for.</p>

<h2>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (February 4 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance was almost a bolt from the blue. Developed by a relatively small team, the game set in 15th-century Bohemia, starring the young blacksmith apprentice Henry from Skalitz, is still to this day one of the most immersive roleplaying games ever released. Very few games managed to make players feel like they were indeed living in a medieval European kingdom as much as the game developed by Warhorse Studios did.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will not revolutionize the formula of its predecessor, but this should be fine for the vast majority of fans, as the second entry in the series will turn every feature of its predecessor up to eleven, offering a lot more different ways to complete quests, better NPCs reactions to Henry's actions, an improved combat system and much more. With a game world twice as large as that of its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will provide plenty of content for players to get lost once again in 15th-century Bohemia and help Henry better shape his future and his destiny.

<h2>Avowed (February 18 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Avowed_Wallpaper_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is a developer that needs no introduction, as it is the studio behind some of the best RPGs ever released, including the celebrated classics Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Fallout: New Vegas, and the Pillars of Eternity series, which, together with a few other games, rejuvenated the top-down roleplaying games that were seemingly being left behind in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>Instead of releasing a third entry in the series, Obsidian decided to expand the world of Pillars of Eternity with Avowed, a project that was pitched as the studio's take on the Skyrim formula but eventually became more in line with what the studio always offered: a more focused game with a smaller scope and heavier emphasis on story and characters. While the world may be smaller compared to other roleplaying games, Avowed will still offer plenty of opportunities to have fun as the player investigates the Dream Scourge plague that is scouring the Living Lands as an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, thanks to multiple recruitable companions, a combat system that will incentivize combining magic spells with weapon attacks, plenty of skills to learn and tons of different locations to explore. Our first hands-on with the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very promising</a>.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring Nightreign (2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ELDENRING_NIGHTREIGN_Key_Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>By all accounts, Elden Ring was a massive success for FromSoftware. The open-world take on the Souls series formula captivated fans all over the world, and the excellent Shadow of the Erdtree expansion didn't sate their hunger for more adventures in The Lands Between. No one, however, would have thought that their next journey to those lands would be with Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series will be a slightly different game than its predecessor, twisting its hardcore action roleplaying game formula with co-op mechanics and procedurally generated locations where up to three players will have to survive for three days and prepare for a massive boss battle while the playable area gets shrunk every time a minor boss is defeated. This battle royale-meets-co-op-meets-roguelite-meets-Monster Hunter experience sounds incredibly exciting on paper, and knowing FromSoftware, there's no doubt that they will be more than up to the challenge of expanding the experience of the original game in a rather unexpected way.</p>
<h2>Fable (2025 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fable_logo_trailer-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite having been announced a while back, there isn't a lot we know about Fable, the next entry in the series since the Kinect game Fable: The Journey, released in 2012. Still, the game is among the most anticipated role-playing games <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching this year</a> for the simple reason that it is more Fable!</p>
<p>From the little we have seen so far, Playground Games will not deviate much from the formula seen in the first three entries in the series developed by the now-defunct Lionhead Studios, as the game will still be set in the luscious fantasy world of Albion, where nature and magic live in perfect harmony, where people talk with an unmistakable Shakespearean flourish, and where villains constantly attempt to disrupt peace and order to further their own nefarious ends. As the series has always been about becoming the hero, it will be very interesting to see how the morality system will return and if the player can decide to become not the paladin Albion needs, but a dark knight that still achieves salvation, but with less savory methods. A lot more will inevitably revealed throughout 2025, and we'll make sure to keep you informed of all the latest info.</p>
<h2>Monster Hunter Wilds (February 28 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Monster Hunter Rise is among the most successful entries in the series, but those who got into CAPCOM's franchise with Monster Hunter World were looking for something more than the condensed, combat-centered experience the game offered. These hunters will get what they are looking for this year with the biggest entry in the series to date.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is not looking to reinvent the wheel in any way, but if the open beta is any indication, the game will offer a little bit for every sort of player, no matter what they are looking for. With huge open-world maps to explore teeming with life and danger, including different weather conditions that can massively affect hunts, massive monsters to take down using any of the 14 weapon types available, a huge number of craftable gear coming with skills to create unique builds, and new gameplay mechanics, which include the ability to bring two weapons and Focus Mode that will allow players to better target monster parts to disable certain attacks and obtain specific materials no matter the weapon they are using, Monster Hunter Wilds is setting out to be yet another landmark release in a series whose popularity is set to skyrocket once again, as we've glimpsed in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview</a>.</p>
