			<p><a href="https://x.com/leaks_infinite/status/1983941972311339311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to leaker leaks_infinite</a>, Halo: Campaign Evolved is just the beginning of a series of remakes already in the works. Allegedly, the campaigns of the second and third game are also being remade and will support optional sprint, just like the remake of the first installment.</p>



<p>The reason for all these games to cut multiplayer from their respective remakes is that Halo Studios does not want to split the fan base across several multiplayer experiences. Because of this, Halo 7, which is also reportedly in development, will be the only one to offer multiplayer. The leaker wrote:</p>



<p><em>Halo Studios wants everyone to play Halo 7's MP, they don't want to create separate multiplayer experiences competing with each other. Which is why they aren't being remade individually. This is a big factor, especially because all these games will be launching on Playstation.</em></p>



<p>The leaker also clarified that the seventh mainline entry will have its own campaign, a sort of sequel to Infinite, but it's possible the multiplayer and campaign won't launch at the same time. They may even be separate, as already seen with Infinite, which offered a premium campaign and a free-to-play multiplayer.</p>



<p>Later, leaks_infinite wrote that it is unlikely Halo 7 will be the actual title, as it doesn't appear that the developers are inclined to return to numbered games. Allegedly, the development team formerly known as 343 Industries has more than four projects currently in the works.</p>



<p>It all starts with <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Campaign Evolved</a>, though. Due next year on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5 for the first time, it'll offer an Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of the series debut, not to mention optional sprint mechanics, new weapons, updated mechanics taken from the later games, and three new missions that will take place before the beginning of the original Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>



<p>A former designer of the 2001 original, Jaime Griesemer, has since <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavily criticized some of the planned</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-designer-likens-remake-to-dance-remix-classic-song-straight-to-chorus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>.</p>

			<p>Independent studio Digital Confectioners has unveiled Triarchy, an upcoming open world co-op (up to three players) action RPG. Like most games in the genre, it will focus on boss fights, but it also supports sailing.</p>



<p>That makes sense after learning that the setting is a 'drowned world'. Players will hunt deadly bosses across the Isles, and the developers promise that each boss fight will feature unique attack patterns, multiple phases, and arena hazards that require precise timing, positioning, and teamwork to overcome.</p>



<p>Upon defeating a boss, you'll get rewards such as unique upgrade materials and boss-exclusive gear. Moreover, Triarchy not only allows boss 'rematches'; players may also find secret triggers to unlock more challenging difficulties. Challenge Mode bosses feature new abilities, attack patterns, and balance tuning. As you would expect, killing these bosses will provide even better rewards.</p>



<p>Defeating foes will also yield experience to level up and then unlock powerful abilities in the talent tree. That way, players can define their own unique playstyle. Triarchy does concentrate mostly on 'intentional' melee combat, at any rate. Fights hinge on stamina, poise breaks, and carefully timed dodges. Parry windows reward precision, but over-committing leaves the character vulnerable to counterattacks. A vast array of weapons, each with its own unique style and feel, will be available. Players can even mix them thanks to the freeform dual-wield system.</p>

<p>The ship will function as a fully customizable and upgradeable floating base. Over time, players can upgrade their ship's hulls, sails, and other components to enhance speed and durability. The ship also houses the workbench and supplies for crafting, and there's even a map table to help with navigation.</p>



<p>The co-op functionality supports no tethering (players aren't forced to be close to one another), shared progress, scaling, and drop-in/drop-out. Triarchy is targeting a 2026 launch, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708040/Triarchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Steam page</a> already includes the minimum requirements:</p>



<ul>
<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>



<li>OS: Windows 10</li>



<li>Processor: Intel Core i3 8100 / AMD Ryzen 3 2300X</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li>Graphics: Nvidia GTX1060 6GB / AMD Radeon RX580 8GB</li>



<li>DirectX: Version 12</li>



<li>Storage: 25 GB available space</li>
</ul>
