			<p>At the PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025, 11 bit studios announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-is-a-mysterious-new-sci-fi-game-from-11-bit-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a> will be released sometime in 2025 for PCs and consoles, launching on Game Pass from day one. Meanwhile, the developers have also just released a free demo that lets gamers check out the intriguing sci-fi survival game right now.</p>
<p>While the basic premise of crash-landing on a hostile world is not at all new, the rest of it is. In The Alters, as suggested by the title, protagonist Jan manufactures alternate versions of himself that originate from decisions he made in the past. These Alters help him repair the mobile base towards the ultimate goal of getting the hell out of that blasted planet, but dealing with them isn't always easy, as they have their own personalities and needs.</p>
<p>In an interview with Wccftech from last May, Lead Designer Rafał Włosek <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> the inspiration for The Alters:</p>
<p><em>There was a lot of brainstorming in general, but we always had this idea about creating a game about how our lives could go if we made different decisions. This was slowly getting more and more concrete when we were talking about it and finally figured out that we wanted to have a game where the player could actually experience meeting a different version of himself who&nbsp;made this different decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Then we thought it would work great in a sci-fi environment, where you could use many different sci-fi technologies to achieve&nbsp;effects that are not so easily achieved in real life, for example. And then, well, there was also this idea about making copies of your own self and interacting with them.</em></p>

<p>Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got to play it</a> and became a lot more interested in the game following the hands-on session.</p>
<p><em>All in all, I'm interested. I started my time at 11 Bit studios with nothing. No knowledge, hype, or excitement for The Alters. I left with a game that I am looking forward to and fully intend to play, either reviewing it or purchasing it upon release. If that isn't a sign of something, nothing is.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hawkswell-announce-celtic-fantasy-crpg-legends-of-awen-rise-of-the-fianna.1053270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hawkswell-announce-celtic-fantasy-crpg-legends-of-awen-rise-of-the-fianna/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The French studio Hawkswell has announced the Celtic-inspired CRPG Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/five-games-you-should-check-out-from-the-pc-gaming-show-2020/">PC Gaming Show</a>. This title is their first title, and was revealed using a presentation trailer that mixed in some pre0alpha in-engine footage alongside some in-game sequences to show audiences what they can expect from the game. To be able to develop this game and finish it off, the studio is seeking support from players via a crowdfunding campaign that will take place in Q1 2025, which will lead to an expansion of the content already in Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna. The plan is to use the funding to be able to expand on the planned number of player choices made in the game, and the impact that their choices will have on the player and other characters in the game.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSrI3-p1CCg</p>
<p>In Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna, you play as Finn, an orphan child who has otherworldly powers. They are the newest recruit for Fianna, and Finn will work their way up to rise and become their leader. This game takes place in the kingdom of Tara, which deals with internal struggles as well as an ancient dark force that lies beneath their land. Players will have to take control of their Fianna warband and lead them through tactical battles while also managing relationships with five unique Companions while working to unlock the power of legendary weapons that are tied to ancient heroes.</p>
<p>In this game, players will be able to choose to participate in turn-based combat. Alternatively, if you prefer to be a pacifist, you can try and use negotiation, charm or intimidation to get through otherwise difficult battles. As with many CRPGs, Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna will have a lot of replayability, which will allow the player to choose to do multiple playthroughs to make different choices and get new endings.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're interested in, you are able to add Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2718100/Legends_of_Awen_Rise_of_The_Fianna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam wishlist</a> now, where you'll be able to see some more in-depth details about the upcoming Celtic-inspired CRPG and what is in store for you if you decide to play it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/caves-of-qud-leaves-early-access-after-15-years-announced-at-pc-gaming-show/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/caves-of-qud-leaves-early-access-after-15-years-announced-at-pc-gaming-show.1053231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/caves-of-qud-leaves-early-access-after-15-years-announced-at-pc-gaming-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As you can guess by the title, Caves of Qud isn't a new game in the slightest. In fact, the game has been available for people to play for about 15 years now, as it's been sat in Early Access since it was announced. This game is well-loved by those who enjoy a roguelike, and Freehold Games announced today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that Caves of Qud has finally experienced a 1.0 launch and is now available for sale on Steam, Itch.io, and GOG.</p>
<p>Caves of Qud is a bit of an outlier in the roguelike category, making it a little bit difficult to put it into one box fully. The game is massive and generates a world full of challenging biomes, including ruins, settlements, and jungles set out to kill you. The game is advertised as a "Science fantasy roguelike epic" as well as a "Deep simulation," which is pretty accurate, as players have free reign in the game. This includes arguing with NPCs and getting into brawls with the most unlikely enemies.</p>
<p>With the release of the 1.0 update, Caves of Qud finally receives a tutorial, which explains the basics of the game to newcomers and to those who want to dip their toes back into the game but may have forgotten how it all works. That's not all, as there is a new final quest in the main questline that initiates the end of the game, along with new music, items, and 40 new achievements for those who enjoy achievement hunting and collecting absolutely everything in the game.</p>
<p>Alongside the 1.0 launch of the game comes the Dromade Deluxe Edition of the game, which includes an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack that can unlock some in-game pets right at the start of the game.</p>
<p>One unfortunate note that the development team at Freehold Games has made is that save files prior to 1.0 won't be compatible with the full version of the game. However, if players find that they want to continue with their old saves, they will be able to switch over to the legacy branch in the Betas menu <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For those wanting to purchase the game, it will cost you $30, but there is currently a 15% discount until December 12. Although it's now fully launched, Freehold Games has said that they have planned more content to add to the game and will share details of that at a later date.</p>

			<p>Brendan Greene, more commonly known as PLAYERUNKNOWN, has dropped a lot of announcements at the PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025. To start with, his company has released a free tech demo called Preface: Undiscovered World <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. This demo is meant to showcase the in-house Melba engine that PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has been developing. Greene said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In Preface, users can witness an Earth-scale world generated in real-time by our machine learning agents directly on their GPU. This digital planet is still quite empty for now, but every person who enters it and shares their feedback contributes to its future development.</em></p>
<p>The studio also launched the Steam page for their first actual game, the single player survival open world title Prologue: Go Wayback!, which will allow the development team to test the machine-learning-driven terrain generation technology, enabling the instant creation of millions of maps.</p>
<p>In Prologue: A Way Back, players will explore a detailed world where emergent systems influence gameplay. They'll face unpredictable weather events and ever-changing landscapes as they attempt to escape the untamed wilderness.</p>
<p>A series of playtests should start soon, with the objective of launching the game on Steam Early Access in Q2 of 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! First Look - PC Gamer Live: Most Wanted" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsFg6xNCin0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, PLAYERUNKNOWN outlined his vision for the final game in this slate, codenamed Artemis, a massive multiplayer sandbox game.</p>
<p><em>My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time, and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds we’re developing.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Our Studio Journey with PLAYERUNKNOWN" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvK-bQwd03g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last we heard about Artemis, PLAYERUNKNOWN <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-says-prologue-will-likely-be-boring-artemis-will-be-planet-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would be 'planet-sized'. That was over three years ago, so things might have changed, but it definitely sounds like the goal is still to make an absolutely massive world.</p>

			<p>Since its release, Citizen Sleeper has been remarked as one of the best indie games of recent times. It even has a Lost in Cult Design Works book dedicated to the game. It's been revealed today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that the sequel to the sci-fi RPG will be released on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on 31 January 2025 and will be available on Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>The first Citizen Sleeper was released in 2022 and won multiple awards, as well as being nominated for four BAFTAS, which included British Game and Game for Impact. This title explores political themes and is accompanied by a fantastically immersive soundtrack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Date Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpiEhTVuISc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developer Jump Over The Age has decided to bring back the Hexport demo so that those interested in the upcoming game can get a taste of what's to come in the full release of Citizen Sleeper's sequel. This demo was previously released for a limited time during Steam Next Fest and will now be available from today until 8 December.</p>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector was first announced in June 2023, and it's been stated by the developers that the sequel will be sticking to a similar template to the first game, as you follow a new Sleeper android protagonist out into space, using the same dice mechanics that were used in the first game. It's been said by Creator Gareth Damian Martin that the central theme for the sequel was "crisis," which is something that the world has seen a lot of. The influences for the theme came from major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a talk with RockPaperShotgun, Gareth Damian Martin spoke about what narrative means to him, and how he uses it to affect the players: "When you make games you have to accept that you are inherently quantifying absolutely everything. Because a game is just a load of numbers. And so even if the player can't see those numbers, they definitely exist," says Martin.</p>
<p>"It's fun to push and pull at that, and have the player... maybe sometimes feel uncomfortable, if they're telling their favorite character what to do. I love the idea of that kind of narrative gameplay infecting the mechanical gameplay."</p>
<p>January is just around the corner, and those excited for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector won't have long to wait at all. Until then, check out the trailer above and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3198860/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector__Hexport_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexport demo</a> on Steam.</p>
