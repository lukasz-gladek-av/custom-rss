			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Pro comparison video covering over 20 games was shared online this week, providing a comprehensive look at how the new system improves and sometimes does not both patched and unpatched games.</p>
<p>The new video, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, puts several patched and unpatched games like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, God of War Ragnarok, The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, Dragon's Dogma 2, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and many others running on the base and Pro models side by side, highlighting the improvements the new system brings in the vast majority of cases. In unpatched games, unsurprisingly, the improvements aren't massive, but they are still noticeable, as in the case of Final Fantasy XVI, which sees a small performance improvement.</p>

<p>Besides featuring a more powerful GPU, the PlayStation 5 Pro's most notable feature is the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which is the first AI-powered upscaler in the console space. Unfortunately, PSSR leaves something to be desired as of now, as it doesn't deliver great image quality in some titles, especially if they have low internal resolution, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/">Alan Wake 2.</a> These disappointing results could be caused by developers having used older versions of the upscaler, as future batches of games should look much better, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">according to a developer.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Consoles are never getting a big leap in power again, as current systems are close to the final spec for what a console could be, according to former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer</a> about the current state of the gaming industry and consoles, Shawn Layden provided some interesting insights on whether consoles can continue to exist in the long term, and if the console war will continue in the future. Taking Nintendo out of the equation, as the company has always managed to do things differently than anyone else, according to the former PlayStation boss, it's time to start thinking about what the purpose of a proprietary console is. Generational leaps in the past have been huge on pretty much every front, but right now, we are getting to the point that differences between generations and systems are minimal, and most people are not interested in teraflops and ray tracing.</p>
<p>As such, the former PlayStation boss thinks that a big generational leap in power is never happening again, as the only leap that's left to make is the creation of<em> "perfectly-realised human actors in a game that you completely control,"</em> which is something that he thinks will eventually happen. At this point, however, the innovation curve of hardware is starting to plateau, and the homogenization of gaming hardware results in very little differences between PlayStation and Xbox hardware, since both are powered by AMD. There will be improvements in the future, but we are now close to the final spec for what a console could be.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this could be the end of the console war, according to the former PlayStation boss, who gave the example of the Betamax, Sony's short-lived answer to the VHS format. Eventually, the industry came together on the format, and the competition switched on the content. This should be the same in the gaming industry, as <em>"content should be the competition for publishers, not which hardware you get behind."</em> For this reason, according to Shawn Layden, the console will become irrelevant in the next few generations.</p>
<p>Speaking about content, the former PlayStation boss provided some interesting comments regarding the possibility of Sony's games releasing on either Xbox or Nintendo systems. PlayStation has been the market leader for almost every generation it has been, and with such a strong lead, there would be no reason to release games on competing hardware, as the small additional sales wouldn't be worth it against the brand impact. Sony is already getting anger from users when they release a former PlayStation exclusive on PC 18 months later, and if this is happening on PC, it would be much, much worse by releasing games on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>The former PlayStation boss's comments on how there will never be a massive generational leap in the future are quite interesting, especially in light of Microsoft promising the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-doubles-down-on-game-preservation-and-largest-generational-leap-claim/">biggest leap ever</a> with their next Xbox. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> will probably play a huge part in this leap, it will be very interesting to see how console gaming will evolve in the future, and if consoles will ever become irrelevant, as Shawn Layden expects.</p>
