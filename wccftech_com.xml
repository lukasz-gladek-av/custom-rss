			<p>Multiplayer games are unique in that they can last for years and years, even decades in some cases, but the excitement of a brand new release cannot be truly matched by DLCs or expansions for existing titles.</p>



<p>Luckily, 2026 looks very interesting on the front of new multiplayer games releases. They're also quite varied, offering a variety of settings and gameplay formulas that are likely to entice many players throughout the year.</p>

<h2 id="h-marathon-march-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-s-x">Marathon (March 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>



<p><strong>Bungie</strong>'s <strong>Marathon</strong> reboot has had to dodge several issues before approaching the launch. The game was originally slated to launch in 2024<span>, but a round of layoffs&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank"><strong>caused a delay until</strong></a></span><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2025</a></strong>. Later, we learned that the former Game Director, <strong>Christopher Barrett</strong>, a veteran who had been at Bungie for more than twenty years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been fired for misconduct</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced by Joe Ziegler</a>, who had previously served as the Game Director of <strong>Riot's Valorant</strong>.</p>



<p>Rumors continued to be uncertain as to the game's quality, and indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another delay was confirmed in June 2025</a> as the studio worked on refinements based on user feedback from previous testing phases. Last month, the development team finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nailed down the <strong>March 2026</strong></a> release while also explaining the updated vision following the aforementioned improvements: proximity chat has been reintroduced (following its great implementation in ARC Raiders, perhaps), solo queuing has been added, and the new <strong>Rook</strong> Runner makes it easier to drop into in‑progress runs with minimal gear but no real risk, improving accessibility. Grass rendering was significantly improved, and now dead bodies remain persistent with decay animation, so that runners visibly deteriorate post-death, increasing immersion.</p>



<p>Whether that will be enough to catch the player's attention for a long period of time remains to be seen, but Bungie's standing in the multiplayer games category makes it impossible to discount them outright.</p>

<h2 id="h-enshrouded-spring-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-s-x">Enshrouded (Spring 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>



<p>German indie developer <strong>Keen Games</strong> may not be a household name like the others on this list of multiplayer games. However, they've already demonstrated their ability to deliver a fun cooperative action RPG with their previous game, <strong>Portal Knights</strong>, which is estimated to have sold between <strong>1.5</strong> and <strong>2.8</strong> <strong>million units</strong> on Steam alone.</p>



<p>Their new game, <strong>Enshrouded</strong>, has already far surpassed it with its early access sales. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it had broken the <strong>four million units milestone</strong> back in April 2025, so it might be approaching five million units by now.</p>



<p>The survival game has proven to be very popular, and with version 1.0 tentatively slated in Spring (though it might slip) on both PC and consoles, it's not long until the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-qa-keen-games-explains-all-about-its-zelda-meets-valheim-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Zelda meets Valheim'</a></strong> game gets out of early access and into more players' hands.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/The_Duskbloods_KeyArt-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-duskbloods-tba-2026-nintendo-switch-2">The Duskbloods (TBA 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<p>FromSoftware already delivered a great multiplayer game in 2025 with <strong>Elden Ring: Nightreign</strong>. With the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive <strong>The Duskbloods</strong>, they're looking to repeat the success while experimenting with a different formula. The Duskbloods is a PvPvE game where eight players simultaneously compete against each other and AI-powered enemies and bosses.</p>



<p>According to the Japanese developer known primarily for the <strong>Souls</strong> series, The Duskbloods underwent the longest gameplay prototyping cycle of any of their games to date. It was greenlit even before <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice's March 2019 release</a></strong> and spent years on pure systems validation and mechanical iteration. The setting appears to blend <strong>Lovecraftian gothic horror</strong> with <strong>Steampunk aesthetics</strong>. As humanity reaches its apocalyptic Twilight, various time periods and spaces converge. Players are the <strong>Bloodsworn</strong>: vampire-like characters transcending human limits through blood-granted superhuman abilities. Based on the released gameplay, we can glean the following details:</p>



<ul>
<li>Victorian weaponry, such as blades, great weapons, and serrated arms)</li>



<li>Firearms reminiscent of Bloodborne's trick weapons</li>



<li>Steampunk jetpacks enabling vertical traversal</li>



<li>Winged stone orbs with Cheshire grins</li>



<li>Occult spells, blood magic, and necromantic summoning</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the game's distinguishing features is that the victory conditions are dynamically variable and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Last Player Standing (traditional battle royale)</li>



<li>Designated Rival Defeat (assigned specific opponent to kill)</li>



<li>Designated Ally Cooperation (assigned ally to find and support)</li>



<li>Boss Defeat (cooperative or solo)</li>
</ul>



<p>Victory Points accumulate through direct combat, strategic evasion, objective completion, or boss kills, theoretically ensuring that solo combat skill doesn't exclusively determine victory.</p>



<p>There are over a dozen Bloodsworn, and each possesses unique weapons, abilities, and aesthetic variations. These characters can also move with superhuman feats, unlike previous FromSoftware games, like ​double Jumps, super jumps, dashing, and air-dashing. Finally, a randomized Event System attempts to prevent stagnation by introducing elements such as special enemy spawns and additional objectives that offer bonus rewards.</p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-november-19-2026-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-s-x">GTA 6 (November 19, 2026 - PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X)</h2>



<p><strong>Rockstar</strong> fans are extremely eager to see what the industry-leading studio has in store for them when it comes to the online mode of <strong>GTA 6</strong>. Whereas GTA 4 had a multiplayer mode that didn't really hold players' interest for long, the exact opposite is true for GTA 5, which has had such a successful online mode that the studio is still continuously updating it (and making a lot of money off it) after thirteen years.</p>



<p>Rockstar literally said nothing about it so far. <span>Thankfully, we at&nbsp;<strong>Wccftech</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought you a rumor from the industry veteran&nbsp;<strong>Rich Vogel</strong></a>, who heard through the grapevine that many of GTA 6's online features are typical of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)</span> and as such, he wouldn't be surprised to see it evolving more toward that direction. That rumor is compounded by Rockstar's acquisition of <span><strong>FiveM's</strong>&nbsp;maker, Cfx.re,</span> back in August 2023. FiveM is the popular community-made online modification framework that provides customized dedicated servers and extensive roleplaying features.</p>



<p>With GTA 6 set to launch on <strong>November 19, 2026</strong>, if the game isn't delayed, we might hear a lot more about the massively anticipated game in the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="h-cinder-city-tba-2026-pc-and-consoles">Cinder City (TBA 2026 - PC and Consoles)</h2>



<p>Korean developer <strong>NCSoft</strong> is going to be very busy in 2026. They're <a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-launch-globally-second-half-2026-monetization-less-aggressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing <strong>Aion 2</strong> to Western countries</a>, for one thing, although the Korean launch hasn't been that well-received. They're also working on another MMO-like game, <strong>Cinder City</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I had the chance to play at Gamescom 2025</a> before chatting at length with <strong>BigFire Games</strong> CEO <strong>Jaehyun Bae</strong>.</p>



<p>Cinder City is a lot like <strong>The Division</strong> in that it's an open world third-person shooter set in a post-apocalyptic city environment. In this case, instead of New York, there's <strong>Seoul</strong>, which has been quarantined following its invasion by 'bizarre lifeforms'. I didn't see any of that in the Gamescom 2025 demo, nor did I experience any cooperation with other players (it was a single player build), but the full game will have both. In fact, the developers assured me we can expect <strong>dynamic events, dungeons, boss fights</strong>, and even <strong>endgame content</strong>. At launch, there will be <strong>between seven and nine playable characters</strong>, each packing different skillsets.</p>

			<p>British developer <strong>Playground Games</strong> will be the absolute star of the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong>, with the first in-depth look at the long-awaited <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and the proper reveal of <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, a sequel to a massively successful game that is estimated to have been played by over 50 million users. Sure, there's also Game Freak's Beast of Reincarnation and even a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-features-secret-fourth-game-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 'secret' fourth game</a>, but those two games are going to be the centerpiece of the showcase due to air on <strong>January 22</strong>.</p>



<p>Officially, both Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are only announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S|X</strong>. However, given <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s multiplatform policy, they are almost certainly coming to other platforms, starting with <strong>Sony's PlayStation 5</strong> console. Forza Horizon 5 launched in April 2025 on PS5 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed extremely well there</a>, after all, which is why some users were surprised when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got announced only for Microsoft's traditional platforms</a> a few months ago.</p>



<p>A few hours ago, speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jph13-tKWcY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the latest episode (#154) of the VGC podcast</a>, Andy Robinson shared why that might be the case. According to his sources at Playground, Forza Horizon 6 simply wasn't ready to launch on PS5 right away, but Fable very well might. </p>



<p><em>Fable's day and date. That's what I've been told. Those are the sort of details where insiders misstep, right? Those are the sorts of details that can be changed a week before or a day before. The other stuff is kind of like a bit more set in stone. Yes, it's coming to PlayStation 5. I'd expect it to be day and date because I know they've been targeting PS5 for a while. </em></p>



<p><em>[as for] Forza Horizon 6, I mean, I don't know the full story of Forza, but the explanation I was told by someone who was there was, like, it just wasn't ready. I don't know how true that is, because I mean, it's going to be absolutely massive, but that game would be absolutely massive if it's launching on everything day one, right? You'd kind of think that's a bit of a hindrance for them. I mean, even Xbox stalwarts are starting to drift away from playing on the console now. It'll have a humongous PC launch, but PS5 I mean, look at like Indiana Jones: The Great Circle. It did so well when it came out on PS5 afterwards. I imagine they'll do their best to get that out as soon as they can.</em></p>



<p>It is indeed surprising, but Playground wouldn't want to delay the launch of FH6 just to wait for the PS5 version to be ready. After all, there's now evidence that even the very late launch of FH5 resonated strongly with the PlayStation community; a few months shouldn't be a problem. On the other hand, launching Fable immediately on all major platforms should enhance the game's visibility.</p>



<p>Neither game has a specific release window yet, but that should change at the aforementioned Xbox Developer Direct 2026. Currently, though, it is believed that Playground will start off with Forza Horizon 6 somewhere in Q2, while Fable will probably debut later in the year (although likely still before GTA 6, if at all possible).</p>
