			<p>Capcom has finally revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-good-chance-of-being-revealed-during-summer-game-fest-rumor/">Resident Evil 9</a>, officially titled Resident Evil Requiem. Not only did Capcom finally reveal RE9, but it also gave us a release date of February 27, 2026, for its arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>The rumors leading into Summer Game Fest 2025 were indeed true, though we definitely got more than we expected considering that we already have a release date to look forward to, and we saw what is almost definitely the most terrifying trailer for a Resident Evil game in the series' history.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for Resident Evil Requiem, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the announcement for Resident Evil Requiem answered a main question that players had around the game (when it'll be out), it left plenty more questions. For example, the trailer stars someone named Grace, not Rose, which is what players who got to the end of Resident Evil Village might've expected.</p>
<p>We don't have too many concrete story details, but we do know that Grace will be going back to the same hotel where her mother was killed, and that Raccoon City is somehow involved once again. We also didn't see any concrete gameplay, so we still don't know if this will be a first or third-person game.</p>
<p>We'll continue to have questions about Resident Evil Requiem until February 27, 2026, when it's finally out on consoles and PC and we can all play it. Until then, it's at least good to know what it is officially called, and to have a date to look forward to.</p>
