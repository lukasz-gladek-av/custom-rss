			<p>It was just yesterday that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> in an official capacity that the Nintendo Switch 2 had sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days. That was already billed as the fastest-selling Nintendo console ever, but now IGN has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> with the Japanese manufacturer that the new hardware is selling twice as fast as the original Switch when considering the same timeframe (the first four days on the market). The Switch had sold 2.7 million units in nearly a month since launching in stores.</p>
<p>So far, analyst estimates have been fully confirmed. Shortly after the console's public reveal in early April, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would be a 'resounding success'&nbsp;<span>with 15 million sold by the end of 2025. Last month, they&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also provided</a> a long-term outlook</span>. Calling it the most important console launch ever, they shared the estimate that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell as many as a hundred million units by the end of 2029.</p>
<p>Wccftech friend Rhys Elliott, who recently moved from MIDiA Research to Alynea Analytics, was a bit more tentative when outlining his outlook. In a LinkedIn post, he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhyselliott_switch2-nintendo-pokaezmon-activity-7338479592954884096-8k0A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that this year's holiday season will be crucial for the console's momentum:</p>
<p><em>I was certain the Switch 2 would initially outsell the original. The OG was heavily supply-constrained and was held back at launch (although the FOMO almost certainly added to demand). This time, Nintendo knew what to expect, so it got all its logistical and inventory ducks in a row. The real question is whether Nintendo can continue this momentum once it has reached all the diehards. I reckon it will keep selling well, but there's caveats.</em></p>
<p><em>The comparison with the Switch 1 is challenging. The original was many consumers' gateway to games when we were all stuck at home during the pandemic. Cozy gamers will mobilize in full force when the next Animal Crossing hits, but it likely won't be a success on the level of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</a></em></p>
<p><em>The big litmus test for the Switch 2's long-term success will be calendar Q4 this year. On the road to the holiday season, Nintendo needs a strong content cadence and to fine-tune its marketing for casual audiences. Nintendo's dev teams have been quiet, so I'm expecting a Nintendo Direct soon to begin drumming hype. There's a little uncertainty still, but I'm optimistic about the Switch 2's long-term potential. If Nintendo nails the holiday season this year, it'll probably nail the whole generation.</em></p>
