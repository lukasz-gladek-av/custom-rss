			<p>Back in November 2024, a year after the PlayStation Portal first launched in November 2023, PlayStation pushed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-4-0-firmware-stuttering-fixed/">Cloud Streaming Beta in a firmware update</a>. Now, yet another year later, a device that everyone would have understandably assumed would support Cloud Streaming from launch (but for some reason did not) now has official Cloud Streaming support, as PlayStation confirmed today that streaming your digital library of games already compatible with streaming is now available to all PS Portal users who are also subscribed to PS Plus Premium.</p>



<p>A new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">PlayStation Blog</a> goes through the features that PS Portal owners can now take advantage of, and the many caveats around cloud streaming on your device. Those caveats being that you can only use cloud streaming if you are subscribed to PS Plus Premium, which as a reminder is the highest of the three PS Plus tiers.</p>



<p>You can also only use it for a select number of digital games in your library. Not every game you have may be available for cloud streaming, as that availability can differ based on region. That said, there are thousands of games available to be streamed, so while <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">you can check out this list of games available for cloud streaming here</a>, chances are what you're looking for is up to be played over streaming.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Along with the feature exiting its beta stage, users who have been testing out the beta will see a few changes. Firstly, for all PS Portal users, today's update offers a new remote play home screen. There's also a new home screen for when you're on the page to play your games over streaming. The search screen now also helps you identify if a game is available to be played over streaming.</p>



<p>Remote play and cloud streaming users also now get full 3D audio support, and there's a new network status screen to help you better gauge your internet connection strength if you happen to be experiencing issues while playing. Also, if you're concerned about someone using your PS Portal when you're not, you can now add a passcode lock to your device.</p>



<p>Regarding cloud streaming-specific updates, you can now access accessibility options like screen readers and adjusting the size of the text on screen, game invitations will work properly while playing a game over streaming, and you can make in-game purchases while streaming your games.</p>



<p>It's a good day for PS Portal users who have been waiting for this to be official, but it feels worth noting that it is almost insane to see a feature that should have come with the device only officially arrive two years after it has been on shelves. </p>



<p>Not that PlayStation doesn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-system-update-adds-support-for-basic-features-like-game-captures-to-cloud-streaming/">already have a history of adding basic features to the Portal late in the game</a>, but when the news of cloud streaming exiting beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-leak-suggests-highly-requested-feature-is-coming-soon/">PS Portal leaked just a week earlier</a>, you'd be forgiven if your reaction was one of complete surprise that it wasn't there at launch.</p>



<p>At least it's here now, and as senior manager in product management at Sony, Takuro Fushimi, says in his PlayStation Blog post, we can "<em>look forward</em>" to PlayStation "<em>sharing more updates in the future</em>."</p>
