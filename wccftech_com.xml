			<p>Today,<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-sims-25-birthday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Electronic Arts</a> is celebrating 25 iconic years of The Sims. This life simulation title has brought people to gaming that typically wouldn't go near games, allowing people to share their creativity and revel in the chaos and madness of Sims. It went from a very humble title with Comic Sans writing to one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, with a million-lifetime players to date.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Sims, there have been some major drops, as well as news regarding updates coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed/">The Sims 4</a>. First and foremost, The Sims 1 and Sims 2 were released as part of a Birthday Bundle celebration. While this news was exciting to most long-term Sims players, there have already been a host of issues, with the games just either not booting or constantly crashing. As a result, it's led to a frustrated community, with many of them refunding the games. The issues have been acknowledged, with the team dedicated to fixing them in future updates.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you want to try your luck, The Sims and The Sims 2 are available via the EA app, Epic Games Store, and Steam for PCs running Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 will also be getting a major base game update today, which adds 70 new in-game items for all players to enjoy, as well as a special event named The Sims 4 Blast From the Past Event. This will take you through a journey of nostalgia and memories while unlocking new items and content in your game by participating in the event.</p>
<p>For those who play The Sims FreePlay, there are special events to participate in with rewards, as well as 25 days of in-game gifts, which include some of the most iconic items from The Sims' history.</p>
<p>In the event you want some<a href="https://shopthesims.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tangible merch</a> that you can showcase in your day-to-day life, there is a limited edition merch collection that features retro pins, a 2000s-themed gamer mat, t-shirts, and more.</p>
<p>For the official 25th anniversary, which is today, a 25-hour live stream is beginning on The Sims YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok channels, where you'll be able to see 25 hours of gameplay, giveaways, and more. This includes people like Doja Cat, Trixie Mattel, Ironmouse, Julien, and more. The live stream will begin at 2 PM PST / 5 PM ET / 10 P GMT. The graphic above showcases the names of the people that will be appearing in the 25-hour stream.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up The Legacy Collection for old-time's sake?</p>

			<p>The developers of Age of Empires have announced today that there will be new content coming to multiple games, as well as their exciting announcement of the franchise reaching 60 million players worldwide.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest news, though, is that both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-might-be-coming-to-playstation/">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a> will be released on Sony's PlayStation 5. This is in line with other Microsoft titles (the Forza Horizon 5 announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-playstation-5-in-spring-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landed&nbsp;just a few days ago</a>), of course, but it is still something we're not used to seeing. Age of Empires has been, after all, one of the very first Microsoft gaming franchises.</p>
<p>Age of Mythology: Retold will land on PlayStation 5 alongside the Immortal Pillars expansion, which will be released on March 4. This expansion will introduce the Chinese pantheon, as well as new maps to explore, myth units, and added gameplay features. For those who want to get their hands on this expansion, pre-orders are now live. Those who own Age of Mythology: Retold - Premium Edition will automatically receive the expansion on day one.</p>
<p>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition will launch on PlayStation 5 later in the Spring. When both titles are released, they will feature content parity across all platforms, as well as cross-play support. This title is currently available on Microsoft Store (and Xbox Game Pass) and Steam.</p>

<p>In addition to these two games being released for PlayStation, it's been confirmed by the developers that new content will be released for Age of Empires IV this year. It will receive two pieces of DLC in 2025, with the first one launching this Spring. The first DLC will be titled "Knights of Cross and Rose" and will give players the opportunity to lead two well-known armies that are inspired by history. It will also introduce a new solo. More information regarding the second DLC will be shared at a later date, most likely once the first DLC has been released.</p>
<p>For those who play Age of Empires Mobile, February will be a big month for you. There are new features and events to participate in, including a new campaign named Battle of Dawn, as well as a new event named Stellar Glory. For Valentine's Day, Age of Empires Mobile will be getting exclusive Valentine's Day cosmetics, as well as three events to participate in that are themed around Princess Josephine's Treasure Hunt.</p>
<p>More information and screenshots are available on the <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Age of Empires website</a>, so you can see what the game will look like with the introduction of the new content in all games. There is also some concept art available to look at, as well as a gift code for those who play Age of Empires Mobile.</p>
