			<p>Ghost of Yōtei is, without a doubt, one of the most anticipated games scheduled to launch in 2025. Its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, was the fastest-selling new IP debut for Sony's PlayStation 4 console when it launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering</a> over 2.4 million units sold in the first three days on the market. It was so successful that Sony even fast-tracked a movie adaptation, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March 2021, only a few months after the game's debut. The film is being directed by Chad Stahelski of John Wick fame.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima was an excellent game, as I said multiple times <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a> at the time. Interestingly, Sucker Punch has decided to make a spiritual sequel rather than a direct sequel. Ghost of Yōtei takes place in another place and another time, featuring a new main character. Now, Sucker Punch and Sony have shared a few more details by updating the game's page <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/?country-selector=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation website</a>.</p>
<p>The new protagonist, Atsu, lives in 1603, at the very beginning of the Edo period, in the lands surrounding the titular Mount Yōtei, the stratovolcano located on the snowy island of Hokkaido. At that time, this area was not officially part of Japan, making it somewhat of a wild frontier.</p>
<p>It is in this context that Atsu's life is upended when her homestead is burned to the ground. Following this tragic event, she undertakes a path of vengeance not unlike that of Jin Sakai, the protagonist of the previous game. According to the website, side content like bounties will provide Atus with the coin needed for the journey, but how she fights, survives, and evolves is entirely up to the player. The developers had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-feature-a-less-repetitive-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at users having more control over Atsu's story, so this could suggest some level of player choice. Could Sucker Punch allow users to choose how to complete some quests? It certainly sounds like it.</p>
<p>The website also promises new gameplay mechanics and improvements as well as new weapons, such as the ōdachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas. The environment will vary from sprawling grasslands with vegetation that reacts to the wind to snowy tundras, all the while gracing players with skies featuring massive sightlines. Of course, Ghost of Yōtei is being developed for PlayStation 5, though it will be best experienced on the PlayStation 5 Pro with enhanced visuals and performance.</p>
<p>The game has no release window yet. Like most publishers, Sony may be waiting to see if GTA VI really launches this year. Stay tuned to get informed when the launch date will be made official.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> was arguably one of the biggest surprises out of The Game Awards 2024. There was no prior rumor that CAPCOM would revive a long-dead franchise whose latest installment launched nearly twenty years ago. Still, fans of the action/adventure franchise were definitely elated, especially after learning that they wouldn't have to wait too long, given the 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Japanese publication Famitsu recently <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/37453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Game Director Satoru Nihei, who shared several details on the game's structure and length. The Producer said:</p>
<p><em>I want to make it a satisfying volume for a single action game. It's not a game where you defeat the same boss over and over like "Monster Hunter," so I think it will take about 20 hours to complete. It hasn't been decided yet, though. Basically, the story progresses as you clear stages. It's not an open world.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Kadowaki said that while the timeline won't change, the location may change, although it will still be mainly focused on Kyoto in the early Edo period (seventeenth century). Regarding difficulty, the two suggested Onimusha: Way of the Sword won't be a super challenging game:</p>
<p><em><strong>Satoru Nihei — </strong>We want a wide range of action game fans to enjoy the game, so we are proceeding with a policy of not making it extremely difficult. However, if the bosses are easily defeated, it will be boring, so we are continuing to make adjustments every day.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Akihito Kadowaki</strong> <strong>— </strong>Having a difficulty setting hasn't been decided yet. I'll say it again, but I want action fans to enjoy the game to the fullest, so I don't want to make it too difficult, and I want to pursue the appeal of being able to feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat it.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two stated that the setting has been completely reimagined, including the Oni and Genma clans. As such, there's essentially no direct connection to the previous installments, which also helps introduce newcomers to Onimusha: Way of the Sword.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, CAPCOM announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has now surpassed the milestone of 10 million units sold across all platforms. This is a new first-month sales record for the publisher, making it a historic occurrence.</p>
<p>The achievement is, however, not at all surprising after the incredible success enjoyed by Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, which have reached 21.30 million units and 16.70 million units, respectively, and occupy the first and second positions in the Japanese publisher's all-time sales chart. Monster Hunter Wilds seems poised to surpass them both in relatively short order, especially considering that CAPCOM has a lot of plans to continue updating the game. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first free update</a> will go live this Friday, adding the new monster Mizutsune, which can be hunted starting at Hunter Rank 21. At Hunter level 41 and above, Tempered Mizutsune will also appear in the environment overview.</p>
<p>Arena Quests, Challenge Quests, and Free Challenge Quests will also be introduced in Title Update 1. Challenge Quests and the newly introduced Free Challenge Quests will only appear as temporary event quests. Arena Quests and Challenge Quests can be completed by up to two players using pre-defined equipment. Meanwhile, Free Challenge Quests have no equipment restrictions and can involve hunting parties of up to four players. All of these quest types can be completed solo, cooperatively in cross-platform online multiplayer, or with the help of support hunters. Replay for faster completion times and earn a spot on the Expedition Record Board for special pendants as rewards. New Event Quests will continue to appear on the Quest Board, offering opportunities to earn special armor, quickly increase your Hunter rank, collect cooking ingredients, and more.</p>
<p>Lastly, the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds update also introduces the Grand Hub to the Monster Hunter Wilds - a massive gathering space for hunters to engage in new ways, such as competing against each other in the Hunter League. Players will unlock the Grand Hub after reaching Hunter Rank 16 by speaking to Tetsuzan in Suja. The entrance to the Grand Hub will also house the Expedition Record Board, which will display the fastest global clear times for the newly added Arena Quests, as well as limited Arena Quest bounties. Each season, the Grand Hub will host a unique celebration. These begin with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance, which runs from 23 April to 7 May. During the festivals, the Grand Hub will change its appearance and the food available, and hunters will be able to obtain limited-time equipment, gestures, pop-up camp decorations, and more.</p>
