			<p>We don't have a release date or a title for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-testing-environment-announced-first-pre-alpha-footage-of-next-entry-in-the-series-shown-in-new-video/">Battlefield</a> game coming out later in 2025, but EA is still showing off plenty of what's to come, and this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1517290/view/564746584593532093">latest update'll</a> make veteran fans particularly happy.</p>
<p>A Battlefield Labs update centered around destruction in the next Battlefield game shows a small clip of gameplay from the work-in-progress build, and it looks like the old-school destruction fans loved in earlier Battlefield titles is back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Community Update - Battlefield Labs - Destruction Example" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khjrOEs5R08?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/">The Battlefield Team</a>, which includes DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and EA Motive, first discussed their philosophy towards destruction in Battlefield.</p>
<p>"<em>Our goals for destruction are centered around adding further gameplay depth by allowing you to reshape the environment and transform your surroundings toward a tactical advantage.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>...We're designing destruction around easily identifiable visual and audio language that lets you understand what can be destroyed, altered, or transformed through gameplay. We aim to make destruction an integral part of your Battlefield experience to create an intuitive, fun, and rewarding environment where you feel empowered to shape the world around you.</em>"</p>
<p>The Battlefield Team also explains that environments will physically degrade from damage and that buildings will 'apple-core' as the exterior walls are destroyed before the core is completely destroyed.</p>
<p>"<em>New mechanics allow you to create more destruction-related opportunities during gameplay, as well as being able to influence your surroundings through the use of different weapons or vehicle types. For example, rubble caused by destruction now remains on the battlefield, and allows you to create and use new opportunities for cover and protection.</em>"</p>
<p>Destruction, like many aspects of the game, is still being tweaked and balanced based on feedback from players who've gotten the chance to play early builds of the game through the Battlefield Labs program. Which you can still sign up for, if you want the opportunity to help shape the future of the series.</p>

			<p>Metal Eden developer Reikon Games and publisher Deep Silver have announced that the game will no longer launch on its previously confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">May 6, 2025, date</a>, but will instead launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in <strong>summer 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The news was announced with a post on the Metal Eden <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/990380/view/542229141158625472?l=english">Steam page</a>, with a quick message to players that feedback from the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-demo-for-upcoming-fps-metal-eden-is-now-available-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-s-x/">demo</a> Reikon Games released made the studio rethink its release date next month.</p>
<p>"<em>We've decided to move the release of Metal Eden to Summer 2025</em>," Reikon Games wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>After going through the feedback from the demo, we saw some clear areas where we can improve. We’re taking a bit more time to refine the game and make sure it delivers the experience we’re aiming for. Your input has been a big part of that process, and we appreciate it.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>We know delays aren’t ideal, and we really appreciate your</em> patience," the announcement continued.</p>
<p>"<em>We’ll share the new date as soon as we can—and we’re confident it’ll be worth the wait.</em>"</p>
<p>At least the demo isn't going away anytime soon, so you can play it as many times as you like while waiting for the official release date to be announced.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-will-detail-diablo-iv%E2%80%99s-season-8-belial%E2%80%99s-return-on-april-24.1167975/</guid>

			<p>Blizzard has <a href="https://x.com/Diablo/status/1912967763338891428">announced</a> that it will host a Diablo IV developer live stream on <strong>Thursday</strong>, <strong>April 24, 2025, at 11 a.m. PT / 2 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. BT,&nbsp;</strong>where it will announce details about the upcoming Season 8: Belial's Return, which is due to launch on <strong>April 29, 2025,&nbsp;</strong>five days after the livestream.</p>
<p>The live stream event will also be followed by a Q&amp;A period during which players can ask questions directly to the development team. Should you miss it in the moment and don't want to rewatch the entire stream, Blizzard will also publish an article recapping everything the live stream discusses.</p>
<p>"<em>Tune in to learn more about the new questline coming with the season, new seasonal powers, and more</em>," Blizzard wrote in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24195998/join-our-next-developer-update-livestream">blog post</a>. More in-depth details about everything coming in Season 8, like the patch notes, will likely come closer to its April 29 launch.</p>
<p>This live stream will instead be our first real look at the new season, and hopefully, some details on the quality of life changes, the new collaboration with an outside series, and Blizzard's plans for Diablo IV's second anniversary, all announced in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/">2025 roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>Also revealed in that roadmap was the news that Diablo IV will not have a full expansion in 2025 but instead will receive a series of seasonal updates throughout the year. A new expansion on the scale of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Vessel of Hatred</a> will be out sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>That's not to say the seasonal updates won't have anything exciting for players. Season 8 in particular will let players take advantage of boss powers for the first time, which players have <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lets-you-claim-boss-powers-for-yourself-next-season-ptr-opens-today/">already been testing</a> in the PTR for over a month now.</p>
<p>When the stream goes live next Thursday, you can tune into it on Blizzard's official Diablo <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/diablo">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Diablo/featured">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo">X</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@diablo">TikTok</a> social channels.</p>
