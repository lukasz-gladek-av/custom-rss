			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-nuclear-disarmament-unlocked-legitimately/">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a> multiplayer features have been expanded this week by a new mod, which introduces a co-op mode that promises to make the experience more fun than ever before, even with its issues.</p>



<p>The mod, which can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/dynamite">developer's unknown 321 GitHub page</a>, has been in the works for some time, and its development was far from simple, as the developer behind the project had to address many issues, as detailed in a <a href="https://github.com/unknown321/dynamite/blob/master/docs/MAKING_OF.md">making-of document.</a> Ultimately, some couldn't be addressed, but the developer decided to release the mod in a semi-working state with some of the planned features missing as well as they believed this could be a solid foundation for a new generation of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain mods that could possibly make the modded co-op mode as fun as the official mode in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@caplag">caplag.</a></p>

<p>Though Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is currently the final entry in the series, and the last one to be directed by Hideo Kojima, the series seems to be far from done. In October 2023, Konami released the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-4k-resolution-support/">Master Collection Vol. 1</a>, including the first three 3D entries in the series as well as the classic first 2D entries in the series, which could be followed by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-metal-gear-solid-4/">second collection</a> that may also end the PlayStation 3 exclusivity of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. In addition, the third entry in the series, which is considered one of the best entries in the series to date, is returning to modern PC and consoles later <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/">this month</a> with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake built in Unreal Engine 5 by Virtuos that aims to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/">improve the game</a> without altering what makes it such a beloved stealth title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X</a>, the new handheld PCs built from a collaboration between ASUS and Microsoft will reportedly launch this coming October 16, 2025. </p>



<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Billbil-kun over at Dealabs</a>, the reliable leaker who has previously correctly leaked release date times and retail prices for multiple devices, who also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">recently reported the prices</a> for the handhelds, with the cheaper ROG Xbox Ally listed at €599, and the more expensive ROG Xbox Ally X at €899. </p>



<p>Billbil-kun also recently reported that<a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-pre-orders-go-live-gamescom-2025/"> pre-orders for the handhelds</a> would start at Gamescom 2025, which lines up with the official confirmation from Microsoft that it would be giving players their first chance at going <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">hands-on with the handhelds during Gamescom 2025</a>. </p>



<p>And as Billbil-kun mentions in their report, this October release date lines up with previous rumors from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WPdijzg6Ug">eXtas1s</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-launching-october-price/">others</a> who have already identified October as a release window for the device. Dealabs is now the first to put a specific date to the leak. </p>



<p>So, as it stands, the official word from Microsoft is that we'll get the chance to try out the handheld at Gamescom 2025. Billbil-kun, who has now built up a strong reputation for reporting accurate retail information on videogame products ahead of their official reveal, has pegged pre-orders to kick off at Gamescom, along with the price reveal, and a release date, the final piece of the puzzle. </p>



<p>Save for the ROG Xbox Ally being at Gamescom, while everything else technically remains in rumor territory, Billbil-kun and their sources have so rarely missed the mark, that it's worth betting we'll see a full official reveal of the price and release date for these handhelds during Gamescom ONL on Tuesday, August 19, ahead of the Gamescom festivities that'll occur throughout the rest of the week.</p>
