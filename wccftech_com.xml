			<p>Morsels, a top-down creature-collecting rougelike shooter from indie developer Furcula and publisher Annapurna Interactive, has a November 18, 2025 release date, the two companies announced today.</p>



<p>The unique and self-described "<em>oddball</em>" game was first showcased at Nintendo's Indie World Showcase in August 2024 and will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch when it arrives this coming November.</p>



<p><a href="https://furcula.ca/">Furcula</a> is a new Toronto-based indie developer, with Morsels being the studio's debut title from a three-person team made up of artist Toby Dixon, musician Sam Webster, and designer and programmer Iggy Zuk.</p>



<p>You play as a little mouse, diving into the sewers for scraps, who happens upon a magical frog-looking creature called a fatberg that transforms you into a Morsel, and grants you the power to swap between other Morsels you find along your journey, switching from one to the next to try and meet your situation.</p>

<p>I played Morsels earlier this year as part of my <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest round-up for the June 2025 Next Fest</a>, and highlighted it as my favorite of the demos I played while the festival was on. At the time, I wrote, "<em>If you don't play any other demos from Steam Next Fest in its closing weekend and only play Morsels, it will have been a Next Fest well spent. This creature-collecting rougelite is weird in all the best ways, with gameplay that feels fun to execute and a roguelite system that I can't wait to dive deeper into. I'm hopeful that this game does make its 2025 release window, only because I absolutely cannot wait to play the full game.</em>"</p>



<p>Thankfully for me, it will indeed be arriving this year, and thankfully for you, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">demo is still available to play on Steam</a> if you want to check it out ahead of release.</p>
