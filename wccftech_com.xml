			<p>Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-playable-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be playable for the first time at Gamescom 2025 next week</a>. The hype among fans is increasing on a daily basis, and the latest round of rumors provided <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955489759536771403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> by CAPCOM insider Dusk Golem will fuel them even further. According to Dusk Golem, while the game isn't an open world as originally designed, it still has open levels such as Raccoon City and a vehicle is available to travel around them. CAPCOM has reportedly been working hard to improve the performance in those Resident Evil Requiem levels, which bodes well given the issues seen in Monster Hunter Wilds. Lastly, Dusk Golem said that the combat segments with Leon have been enhanced with some elements borrowed from The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p><em>Right now, officially, they've talked about the ability to switch between first &amp; third person on the fly (and basically designing two different games alongside each other to accomplish this as it required big retooling to work with both), the new lighting/shadow engine, the hair engine from Pragmata. Additionally, we know the stalker uses a new dynamic AI system they've done to behave uniquely and intelligently on the fly. There's a few other innovations, some I know, but also, sure, I don't know all of them. A small handful I don't mind sharing is they've been working hard to achieve having good performance on open-level designed areas like Raccoon City, along with a vehicle to travel around it. The combat with Leon has seen huge innovations, honestly, some The Last of Us Part 2-isms, but also its own innovations.</em></p>



<p><em>There's been an effort to provide more environmental physics systems and interactivity for Grace's segments where she has to work with the environment more, and balance light and darkness. And more I won't say, and sure more I don't know. But they have a lot more to reveal.</em></p>



<p>It should be noted that, at this time, Resident Evil Requiem only has one official protagonist, FBI technical analyst Grace Ashcroft, who is sent to investigate a series of strange deaths at the Raccoon City hotel where her mother died eight years ago. However, CAPCOM has often kept other playable protagonists quiet throughout the series, so it wouldn't be too much of a surprise if the Leon rumor turned out to be true.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid ‘Fox Hunt’ Multiplayer Mode Launches in Fall with No Crossplay]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-%E2%80%98fox-hunt%E2%80%99-multiplayer-mode-launches-in-fall-with-no-crossplay.1269816/</guid>

			<p>KONAMI announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox Hunt</a>, the multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, will be available sometime in the Fall season. However, there's also some bad news: the official Japanese account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1955585126286377462%7Ctwgr%5E73386f46dba965f7676b994d8eff39cf2cc05419%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fmetal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-will-not-support-cross-play-konami-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that there will be no crossplay in Fox Hunt. </p>



<p>This is less than ideal, to say the least, especially for a multiplayer mode that launches after launch. Most players might have already forgotten about it by the time Fox Hunt becomes available. Some fans are already worried that the mode could be 'dead on arrival', although that's way too early to say. </p>



<p>Fox Hunt has been heavily inspired by the fan-favorite Metal Gear Online, as outlined in the mode's official description: </p>



<p><em>A thrilling, hide-and-seek-based, completely original online multiplayer experience. This unique Metal Gear online experience utilizes the central elements of the base game: camouflage and survival.</em></p>



<p><em>It is based on the Sneaking rule from METAL GEAR ONLINE. It utilizes the fundamentals of one of the most popular game rules from METAL GEAR ONLINE, as well as the iconic sneaking gameplay elements of the METAL GEAR series. The latest graphical enhancements amplify the tension of hide-and-seek to a whole new level.</em></p>



<p>Still, this is really just an extra. The main course will be the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, which fans of the series have been waiting for a long time. Developed with the help of Virtuos (which also took care of the Oblivion Remaster) in Unreal Engine 5, MGS: Delta Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to debut in exactly two weeks</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game features a few quality-of-life improvements, such as a modern control scheme (although the original is optionally available, too), but the original's core experience remains intact. We'll soon learn if it stands the test of time.</p>
