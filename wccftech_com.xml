			<p>Some of the issues found in the PC version of DOOM: The Dark Ages will require a driver fix, and thus won't be fixed with any patch that may launch once the game releases to the public later this week.</p>
<p>Following the game's early access release for all who pre-ordered it, developer id Software shared a new FAQ, including a list of known issues on all platforms. The list of PC issues is rather substantial, and includes issues like crashing issues when playing on an RTX 50 series GPU with G-Sync or V-Sync enabled and Multi Frame Generation, game locking issues when resizing the window manually while using AMD FSR frame generation, game launching in the background if alt-tabbing on an NVIDIA GPU, OBS capturing issues and others. Some of these issues, as mentioned above, require some driver fixes and may take some more time to get fixed.</p>
<p>You can find the full list of DOOM: The Dark Ages known PC issues and their fixes or workarounds below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 50 series GPU and enable G-Sync (supported display required) or V-Sync plus Multi Frame Generation through NVIDIA Control Panel you can crash the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until a driver fix is available, the workaround for this issue is to either disable one of these options in the NVIDIA control panel or if you want both enabled, set them in-game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 40 or 50 series GPU and enable Multi Frame Generation or FrameGen, V-Sync still shows as enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a minor cosmetic issue – the game disables V-Sync under the hood in these cases.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA GPUs may find that Alt-Tabbing while launching the game can cause the game to launch in the background and not be accessible.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a known driver issue. Until a fix is available in a driver update, to avert this issue, avoid Alt-Tabbing during game launch. If encountered, it can be resolved by restarting your PC.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA 50 series GPUs may experience TDRs or system hangs when starting gameplay recording using Shadowplay with MultiFrameGen set to 3x or 4x.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, either do not use the noted MFG settings or record gameplay with a different application.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If capturing with OBS, game visuals may freeze when Alt-tabbing from Fullscreen</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until there is an update from OBS, the workaround for the issue is to capture in Windowed or Borderless mode.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: The game can lock up when manually resizing the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not manually resize the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users who unplug a 2nd monitor during gameplay may notice that the game has frozen.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not unplug any monitors while playing the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Players running the game with the MSI Afterburner or RivaTuner overlays enabled may experience stability issues.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not run the game with either application running in the background.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: In rare cases, players running DOOM: The Dark Ages on a supported PC spec at appropriate settings, who have the latest GPU drivers installed and also have an intel CPU model number that starts with the number 13 or 14 can run into persistent crashing.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: In such cases, you may have a corrupted CPU. Please contact intel Customer Support at&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsupport%2Fcontact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/contact.html</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages also has some known issues on consoles as well. Some of these issues are already being investigated and will potentially be fixed in future updates. You can find the full list <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3017860/view/509579946274851061">here</a>.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S for all those who pre-ordered the game. It will become available for everyone else on May 15th.

			<p>The successful release of Monster Hunter Wilds and the strong sales of other titles, including previous entries in the series, have driven another record year for CAPCOM.</p>
<p>In new <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/result/2024/full/4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents</a> shared today presenting the financial results of the fiscal year ending March 31st, the Japanese publisher reported 169,604 million net sales and 65,777 million yen operating income, an increase of 11.3% and 15.2% respectively, over the previous fiscal year. The Digital Contents Business, the publisher's video game business, recorded 51.87 million units sold, over 5 million units more than the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The excellent results of CAPCOM's Digital Content Business were mostly driven by Monster Hunter Wilds, which managed to ship 10 million units in just one month of availability. Other games by the publisher have contributed to the strong sales in the fiscal year, including solid sales of past entries in the series, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which have brought the total units shipped worldwide to over 100 million units.</p>
<p>Though no major release in the vein of Monster Hunter Wilds has been announced to date, CAPCOM is expecting FY2026 to be another record year with net sales expected to exceed 190,000 million yen and operating income 73,000 million yen, a 12% and 11% increase over the previous fiscal year. As this year's lineup at the time of writing only consists of remasters and ports, with only <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-will-last-20-hours-and-wont-be-open-world-says-capcom/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> being the only new game scheduled for 2026, there's a very good chance there will be some surprises launching before March 31st, 2026.</p>
<p>Though low difficulty and performance issues impact the experience, Monster Hunter Wilds' success is completely deserved, thanks to its open-world approach that makes the typical gameplay loop even more engaging.

			<p>Ukrainian game developer Frogwares&nbsp;<span>surprised its fans today with the sudden launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-remastered-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sinking City Remastered</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.

<p>This remaster leverages Unreal Engine 5 technology to improve the original game's visuals in various ways, as you can see in the trailer below. There are even some gameplay tweaks. Here's the complete list of improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The game is fully relit in Unreal Engine 5</span></li>
<li><span>Enhanced locations with additional levels of detail and objects</span></li>
<li><span>4K textures and improved reflections</span></li>

<p>Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares, teased 'big things' for the franchise:</p>
<p><em>We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond. So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game’s twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.</em></p>
<p>Less than two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an exclusive interview with Sergiy Oganesyan on The Sinking City 2. The sequel was funded through Kickstarter with $627K in pledges, which was 450% of the minimum target set by Frogwares. As a reminder, The Sinking City 2 will be a full-fledged survival horror game with greater emphasis on combat. However, Frogwares plans to maintain the investigation mechanics as an optional bonus feature that will make life in the game easier for those who choose to engage with it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5.1187664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silver Studio and Elementa have unveiled a new free-to-play open world gacha game called Silver Palace. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game features a rather refreshing Victorian era-inspired setting, albeit still with the anime-like art style we've previously seen in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-will-soon-require-age-verification-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a>. The game is being developed for PC, console, and mobile devices, and the combination of the reveal trailer and 10-plus-minute-long gameplay showcase has already shown quite a bit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silver Palace Trailer | The Golden Age of Detectives" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELC4r7fbKEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, Silver Studio also shared a detailed overview of the features and content:</p>
<p><em>Silver Palace is a brand-new ARPG set in a prosperous metropolis with a Victorian aesthetic. It features an engaging story, a delicate art style, distinctive characters, and a dynamic, action-oriented combat system. Players will play the role of a “Detective” and embark on an adventure with a diverse group of partners to defeat the unknown enemies and unravel the mysteries in Silvernia, an industrialized metropolis built on the power of Silverium.</em></p>
<p><em>The discovery of Silverium was the key to Silvernia’s industrialization. This revolutionary element transformed technology and daily life beyond imagination, attracting numerous residents and fostering innovation. The city became a hub of miracles, driven by the massive industrialization and monetization of Silverlum under the city’s administration.</em></p>
<p><em>In Silver Palace, players assume the role of a “Detective” tasked with investigating crimes and uncovering hidden truths. As various factions—from corporate monopolies and underground syndicates to royal affiliates and cults – vie for control of Silverium, tensions rise across the city.</em></p>
<p><em>Players can switch between characters in real time to unleash powerful skills and chain QTE combos. As they explore the city’s sprawling environments, they’ll dive into the scenes of crime, hunt for clues in the shadow, battle their enemies and in the process reveal more of the stories of Silvernia.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Silver Palace Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIUa74hDJiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pre-registration for PC and mobile devices (which will likely launch before consoles, as usual with these games) can be submitted <a href="https://silverpalace.elementagames.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official game website</a>.</p>
