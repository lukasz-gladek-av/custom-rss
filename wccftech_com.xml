			<p>Wrekcreation, the sandbox open-world arcade racing game from Three Fields Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">a studio founded by former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the Burnout series, is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Published by THQ Nordic, Wreckreation gives players the freedom to create whatever kinds of tracks they want, from the kinds of things you'd only expect to see in <a href="https://wccftech.com/hot-wheels-unleashed-one-million/">Hot Wheels Unleashed</a> to something super realistic if that's more your speed, and race the wide variety of vehicles on them to your heart's content.</p>



<p>With more than 400 square kilometres of space to create tracks in and absolutely wreck your cars, along with 16 radio stations and the ability to mix game modes, weather and atmosphere effects, and of course, the cars themselves, there's more than enough to dig your heels into as you slam on the gas.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>What makes Wreckreation feel like a complete sandbox is the fact that you don't have to stop and jump into a separate mode to switch between driving and racing around to creating tracks. Have an idea for a new layer of track to add or a new ramp, obstacle, or basically any other kind of addition? Press a button and add it right there.</p>



<p>It definitely looks like the kind of game where you'll have to make your own fun, but as it stands, Wreckreation also seems to give you every tool you might want to do so when it comes to having mindless fun racing around and smashing cars.</p>



<p>Wreckreation is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S for $39.99/€39.99.</p>

			<p>Developer ArenaNet has launched the sixth major expansion for Guild Wars 2 today, with Visions of Eternity <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/">now available to players on PC</a>. Visions of Eternity adds a new island to explore called Castora, with two new maps to explore, a new storyline, and plenty more.</p>



<p>The new storyline kicks off with whispers and rumors of the island of Castora, with the Tyrian Alliance stepping in to uncover more about the magical island once they discover that the Inquest has begun sniffing around for Castora.</p>



<p>Alongside two new maps included with the new expansion, Shipwreck Strand and Starlit Weald, players will be able to check out a new and improved skimmer, new raid encounters, a new homestead plot, and new legendary gear. Visions of Eternity will also feature new boss fights, new skills, and new seasonal rewards.</p>

"<em>This is the first time Guild Wars 2 is going to a location in Tyria that's truly brand new to all players. The island vibe of the setting gives us a lot of room to explore improvements and evolutions to the skimmer and homesteads that are also thematically appropriate to the setting, and we can't wait to see</em> <em>how players tackle our new world and raid bosses</em>."</p>



<p>The new expansion is available for $24.99, and ArenaNet has plans to release multiple free content updates to the expansion throughout 2026.</p>

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now supports the PlayStation 5's power saver mode, and its implementation is among the most interesting to date, according to a new technical analysis.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> examined how the two entries in the Kojima Productions series support Power Saver Mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">a newly introduced operating mode for the PlayStation 5 console</a> that cuts CPU resources in half, halves the memory bandwidth, and reduces CPU and GPU clocks to reduce the system's power consumption.</p>



<p>While the implementation in Death Stranding: Director's Cut was not particularly challenging, as it is the enhanced port of a PlayStation 4 game, things get more interesting in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. According to Digital Foundry, Power Saver mode in the second entry in the series, at a glance, only runs the game in Performance Mode while capping the framerate to 30 frames per second.</p>



<p>A closer look, however, reveals some interesting details. Tessellation and geometry, for example, are in line with that seen in Quality Mode, while the resolution is kept at 1440p, although with dynamic resolution scaling in place. This approach is interesting in how the developer worked around the constraints to balance the reduced framerate, possibly caused by the CPU limitations, with increased fidelity in some instances over Performance mode.</p>



<p>Seeing how Kojima Productions handled Power Saver Mode support in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach again raises the question of why so much effort is being put into supporting an operating mode that will likely see very little use. According to Digital Foundry, this could be a way to prepare developers for a certain level of expected flexibility required to scale games on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">rumored PlayStation handheld.</a></p>



<p>As is, however, the current Power Saver Mode shouldn't be considered as an early showcase of what the rumored PlayStation handheld will deliver, as a 115W power target is way too high for a device that will likely target between 15 and 25W, and the resolution of all the games currently supporting Power Saver Mode is way too high for a portable device, usually 1440p if not even higher in some instances. This further reinforces how supporting Power Save Mode is mostly preparation work for the rumored handheld.</p>

<p>Among the few PlayStation 5 games supporting Power Saver Mode besides Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is the Demon's Souls Remake by Bluepoint Games.
