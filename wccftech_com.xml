<h2>Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds is getting the first major update "Godspawn" on November 19th, expanding the story with new story chapters</h2>
<p>The MMORPG Guild Wars 2 by ArenaNet is receiving its first major update for the Janthir Wilds expansion soon. It's the first of three major updates, and it'll land on November 19. The update will add new content to the game for the players.</p>
<p>The <em>Janthir Wilds&nbsp;</em>expansion DLC was released in August this year, bringing unexplored wilds and&nbsp;<em>Homestead&nbsp;</em>for players to decorate and cultivate. With the <em>Godspawn&nbsp;</em>update, the game will bring three new story chapters to continue the adventure against the Titans. This time, ArenaNet has introduced a new 50-player battle against a Titan, who will be the reinterpretation of <em>Decima. </em>It will be similar to the boss battles as introduced in the <em>Secrets of the Obscure </em>Convergence.</p>
<p>Players can enter the battle every three hours, but private squads can start the challenge at any time. Apart from the boss battle, Guild Wars 2 will also receive a new 10-player raid, allowing players to climb Mount Balrior to battle the titans of Janthir to obtain rewards such as marquee items and cosmetics.</p>

<p>The 10-player raid will feature three bosses and several smaller battles that will allow players to enhance their coordination and adaptability. The two bosses,&nbsp;<strong>Greer&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Decima</strong>, will regroup once again at Mount Balrior, stronger than before as this time they won't be alone and will also have newer abilities.</p>

<p>Several new updates are also on the way in Godspawn update, including the new Sea Wave Glass weapon, more rewards in the Wizard's Vault like skins for armor and boots, and new decorations for Homestead to customize living space. A new legendary spear, <em>Klobjarne,&nbsp;</em>will be available to players as well. The Godspawn update will be free for those who have purchased the <em>Janther Wilds&nbsp;</em>expansion. Two more updates will be released in the coming months to complete the expansion.</p>
