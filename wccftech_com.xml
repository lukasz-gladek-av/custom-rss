			<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate, the 2D-action platformer from developer Bitmap Bureau Ltd. and publisher Reef Entertainment, has been delayed for a third time, though thankfully, players who've been anticipating this old-school take on Terminator will still be able to play it on PC and console platforms before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>It was initially set to arrive on September 5, 2025, though ahead of that launch, it was pushed to October. After that, it was pushed to November 26, 2025, and twenty days ahead of that release date, it was pushed again to its current, and hopefully final release date, December 12, 2025.</p>



<p>"<em>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you</em>," publisher Reef Entertainment began <a href="https://x.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the third (and hopefully final) delay for Terminator 2D: No Fate. "<em>We know you've waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey</em>."</p>



<p>This delay is, unfortunately, once again caused by issues Reef Entertainment has had with regard to the physical editions of the game. Before, the issue was tariff and trade-based, with the different components needed for the physical editions. Now that it has all that sorted, it needs to put the physical editions together.</p>



<p>"<em>The physical components for all editions have now finally arrived, following the ongoing delays that pushed us off our previous schedules. However, we now have to assemble the physical editions,</em> <em>which we need some time to do. Because of this, we are moving the launch date of Terminator 2D: No Fate to December 12, 2025, for all physical and digital versions of the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays. We don't take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there</em>."</p>

<p>It's unfortunate that players are left waiting a little longer, but delaying the game not for issues with the game itself, but for issues with the physical release, is commendable because it speaks to the publisher wanting everyone who is going to grab Terminator 2D: No Fate at launch, whether they're buying the physical edition or digital version, the same day-one experience. </p>

<p>At least it's still arriving before the end of the year, and Termiantor fans will have something to play while they wait for Terminator: Survivors, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-has-been-delayed-to-2025/">still has no release date despite being given a 2025 release window in August 2024</a>.</p>
