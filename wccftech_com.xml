			<p>Today, Switzerland-based AI startup <a href="https://ovomind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ovomind</a> presented what it calls the eponymous world's first technology for powering 'emotion-driven gameplay.' The technology measures the player's body's reactions in real-time thanks to a wearable smartband, with the goal of capturing the player's emotional state and submitting it to games.</p>
<p>Yann Frachi, co-founder and CEO, Ovomind,&nbsp; said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>At Ovomind, we believe the future of gaming lies in forging a deeper connection between players and the worlds they explore. By harnessing the power of emotional AI, we’re not just creating games that respond to actions, but to feelings—delivering a truly immersive experience where every heartbeat shapes the journey.</em></p>
<p>Julien Masse, co-founder and CTO, added:</p>
<p><em>After captivating audiences with successful demos at the Tokyo Game Show in Japan, we’re thrilled to bring this groundbreaking technology to the U.S. for the first time at the Game Developers Conference in 2025. Attendees will get the chance to ‘feel’ the game adapt to their emotions in real time—where every heartbeat shapes the adventure—ushering in a new era of games immersion.</em></p>
<p>At GDC 2025, which takes place in San Francisco between March 17 and 22, attendees will be able to try out the Ovomind DK1 Developer Bundle, for which pre-orders are now open at $199.99 ahead of the expected launch in Q2 2025. The bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ovomind Smartband</li>
<li>Ovomind App (iOS, Android, Desktop)</li>
<li>Ovomind Web Platform &amp; Studio Dashboard: Provides advanced analytics and insights</li>
<li>Ovomind Online SDK to set up game interactions and customizable analytics</li>
<li>User Research &amp; Analytics Tools: Includes video playback with dynamic emotion heatmaps</li>
<li>Access to Exclusive Tech Demo - Dead Shadows</li>
</ul>

<p>Dead Shadows is a five-minute tech demo created by Marc Albinet, who was the Game Director of Assassin's Creed Unity and Dying Light 2: Stay Human, to show off Ovomind's Affective Gen AI. In the demo, users will experience two modes: Psychological Terror, which heightens suspense with unsettling visuals, eerie soundscapes, and gameplay elements that react to fear, and Adaptive Relaxation, which transitions gameplay to a calming environment, allowing players to manage stress and experience tranquility.</p>
<p>A free offline SDK with simulated data for Unreal Engine and Unity developers can be received simply by contacting Ovomind <a href="https://wccftech.com/ovomind-to-present-worlds-first-emotion-driven-gameplay-gen-ai-tech-at-gdc-2025/sdk@ovomind.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this email address</a>.</p>

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod released today introduces a new handy feature that allows players to add more characters to their active combat party, including those not normally available and that never actually join the party during the course of the game.</p>
<p>The Party Mod Menu, developed by Braklinath and now available for download on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/530?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, adds an in-game menu to change the party members that participate in battle, making it possible to make every available character an active combat character, change the party leader and add characters that do not join the party during the course of the game, including Sephiroth, Zack, Cid, and Vincent. Having any of these four characters in the party, however, can lead to issues outside of combat, and even in combat, as the game even locks up if either Cid or Vincent are in the active combat party, which is not surprising since the two characters were never meant to be playable in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. In case you want to check out how the mod works before downloading it, you can watch a video showcase provided by the mod's developer below.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>
