			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is unlikely to use the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering like Oblivion Remastered does, as it would do little to address some of the most common Creation Engine complaints, like the fragmented game world.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry responded to a fan's question about whether The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a test for the next entry in the series. They highlighted the possibility is definitely there, as other studios have done something similar in the past, essentially making Unreal Engine their own, like Housemarque with Returnal.</p>
<p>Still, it seems unlikely that The Elder Scrolls VI will use Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, as the Epic engine would not solve any of the most significant issues of the Creation Engine by itself. As highlighted by Oblivion Remastered, the Unreal Engine 5 was still limited by the Gamebryo engine powering the rest of the game, and the game world was still as fragmented as it was in the original. At the same time, rendering was not exactly an issue in Starfield, and with the Creation Engine likely getting rendering improvements for The Elder Scrolls VI, having Unreal Engine 5 rendering would only serve to delay the game further, complicate development and potentially add performance issues, as Oblivion Remastered is extremely heavy and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">runs poorly on pretty much everything that isn't a top end machine with frame generation on top.</a></p>

<p>With The Elder Scrolls VI still far from release, the launch of Oblivion Remastered allows players to return to Tamriel ahead of the launch of the next entry in the series. Despite performance issues and some visual changes, the remaster is a game worth experiencing, keeping the original's magic intact, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>. The game is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI doesn't need another trailer to get people excited about the game. On the contrary, the element of surprise would make its launch an even bigger success, according to a former Rockstar Games developer.</p>
<p>As part of a social media celebration of the 17th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto IV, which includes some interesting insights on the lead platform, which was the Xbox 360 due to how difficult it was to develop on PlayStation 3, and how the decision to delay the game to April 29th, 2008 was made four months before the original October 16th 2007 release date, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij commented on how they would handle Grand Theft Auto VI marketing cycle, saying that, if it were their call to make, they wouldn't release any additional trailer. There's already plenty of excitement for the game's release, and the element of surprise would make the release bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Also:<br>
If it was my call I wouldn’t release any additional trailers.<br>
There is more than enough hype around VI and the element of surprise is going to make the release only bigger as an event.</p>
<p>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1917025732074655981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After releasing the game's announcement trailer in late 2023, Rockstar Games hasn't talked much about Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite the silence on the game, however, Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-still-scheduled-to-release-this-fall-take-two-full-expects-to-support-the-nintendo-switch-2/">reiterated</a> back in February that the game is still scheduled to release this Fall to contribute, together with Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, to what is shaping up one of the strongest ever for the publisher, though it could have been even stronger if the game launched on PC at the same time as console.</p>
<p>While we haven't seen much of Grand Theft Auto VI in action, the recent release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition</a> on PC allowed us to get some sort of preview of the tech that will power the visuals of the next entry in the series. From some tests, however, it's clear how the game will likely target 30 FPS on base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as CPUs on par with those powering the current generation of consoles struggle to handle the game properly at above 30 frames per second.</p>
