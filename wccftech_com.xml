			<p>Unlike base Elden Ring, where the differences between classes are minimal in the long run, the eight Nightfarers available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> are quite different from one another, coming with some unique skills and traits that make them better suited for certain playstyles.</p>
<p>While every Nightfarer is more than viable to defeat the powerful Nightlords awaiting them at the end of each run, one of them has some clear advantages over the others, so much so that a team of three of the same one can make very short work of most Nightlords, even if the random generation of upgrades hasn't worked in the players' favor the previous two days. This Nightfarer is <strong>Ironeye</strong>.</p>
<p>On paper, a ranged fighter like Ironeye doesn't inspire much confidence, but the mechanics that made ranged-exclusive playstyles more limited in the original Elden Ring and every other entry in the Souls series are gone in Elden Ring Nightreign. Bows and crossbows have <strong>infinite ammo</strong>, allowing their wielders to spam long-range attacks as long as they have stamina. And in a game where you are constantly swarmed by a great number of enemies, this is extremely beneficial, as it gives you the chance to better control crowds while staying out of danger.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250528130002_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The above, however, isn't the only reason why Ironeye is so good in Elden Ring Nightreign at launch that he can take on Nightlords even solo and win. His Character Skill and Ultimate Art, <strong>Marking</strong> and <strong>Single Shot</strong>, are among the best in the entire game. The first is a quick lunging slash with plenty of invincibility frames that marks hit enemies, exposing their weak points. Once the weak points have been destroyed, the enemy will be staggered and open to a critical hit. The second is a powerful arrow that hits in a wide radius, knocks the vast majority of enemies down, even some bosses, and can bring back to life downed companions in a single hit, all the while making Ironeye invincible for the entire duration of the attack. Both abilities can be used both offensively and defensively to get out of a sticky situation and deal tons of damage, and the very quick cooldown of Marking allows Ironeye to see it very often.</p>
<p>Ironeye's weapon of choice, the bow, also works great in conjunction with ailments like <strong>poison, frostbite, and scarlet rot</strong>, which are extremely powerful in Elden Ring Nightreign as much as they were in the base Elden Ring at launch. A bow with the <strong>Barrage</strong> skill and the ability to inflict status ailments is invaluable, as you can inflict the affliction much more quickly using the skill. Even when using a weapon with no elemental or affliction property, Barrage works great with the Marking skill and builds that improve critical hits. To increase your chances of being able to use this strategy, pinpoint locations on the map showing the status alterations icon and defeat the bosses there. These locations have a higher chance of weapons with the related affinity being offered as rewards.</p>
<p>At the beginning of your adventure in Limveld, Ironeye may not be an enticing choice over other Nightfarers, but give him a chance, and you will be surprised by how good he is. Parties of multiple Ironeyes can destroy most bosses, while solo, he will allow you to enjoy the game more, as he has an easier time dealing with the gameplay elements that make solo play very challenging to the point of frustration. During the review period, I played solo rather often, and my only successful runs were with Ironeye. Not only did I almost always get the final day to fight the Nightlord, but I also managed to defeat Gladius and Maris without the help of any player, while also getting very close to defeating a few of the other Nightlords. It's still no walk in the park, to be sure, but considering the high challenge level and how much melee characters struggle in a lot of different situations, Ironeye does make Elden Ring Nightreign a little more manageable, no matter the situation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign – How Passive Skills Work]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-passive-skills-work/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-how-passive-skills-work.1202427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-passive-skills-work/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though based on the mechanics seen in the game released in 2022, Elden Ring Nightreign changes and twists a good number of them so that they can work in its fast-paced, co-op-focused experience. Among the mechanics that have been changed are those that power Armaments, the weapons that all Nightfarers can use in Limveld to fight against the Nightlords and their hordes.</p>
<p>Every Armament in Elden Ring Nightreign, with the exception of the starting Armaments of each character, comes with passive skills. These skills range from simple HP, FP, and Stamina increases to more situational skills, such as abilities that come into effect when conditions are met, such as high or low HP, inflicting certain status ailments to enemies, and so on. As these effects can be extremely beneficial, understanding precisely how they work can make the difference between victory and defeat in a run.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529002954_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As a general rule, <strong>passive skills attached to Armaments are always active</strong>, so just having an Armament in your possession will activate the skill, even if you are not actively equipping or using said Armament. The <strong>exceptions</strong> to this rule are certain passive skills with a <strong>small hand icon</strong> in the main menu, such as the Add Magic to Weapon skill in the screenshot above. This icon indicates that the passive skill is only active when equipping and using the weapon, and it usually comes attached to skills like HP or FP restoration when hitting enemies.</p>
<p>A big part of the Elden Ring Nightreign experience is to make your character as powerful as possible before Day 3 and the fight against a Nightlord, so filling your Armament slots with weapons that come with useful passive skills should be your priority. As such, you should pick up even Armaments you don't plan on using to take advantage of these mechanics, and increase your character's power to survive the Night and all the dangers it brings.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An Elden Ring Nightreign duos mod is currently in the works, and its release could address one of the game's most critical issues at launch.</p>
<p>The mod, which is sadly not yet available to the public, is being developed by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukeyui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yui</a>, who showcased it in a new video shared on YouTube. As the mod runs without connecting to the matchmaking service, Easy Anti Cheat is deactivated and thus other mods can be used during gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign: 2 player demonstration (w/ no EAC &amp; mod compatible)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbKF9TOiMWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Elden Ring Nightreign development team already <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">confirmed</a> that duos could be added to the game in the future, it's nice to know that, at least on PC, a two-player mode could be a thing, regardless of what the developer decides to do. One of the other critical issues of the latest game developed by FromSoftware, the lack of cross-platform play, however, cannot be easily fixed with mods, so hopefully, the development team will look at implementing it down the line in some form.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about this unique take on the Souls series formula by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/</link>

			<p>HLX, the project in development by Valve rumored to be Half-Life 3, may be close to the end of development, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McViker</a> in a recent video, big updates have been pushed for Deadlock and Dota 2, and they are more packed than has been seen in years of changes made to the Source 2 engine related to the HLX project, some of them heavily suggesting that the project is near to the end of development. For example, one of the new changes is a save and load system rewritten from scratch, which allows for the state of any entity within the game world to be edited in the save file. No other game powered by the Source 2 engine has a save and load system, as even Half-Life Alyx used the system lifted from the previous version of the engine. While this addition may not sound particularly significant, it actually is, as rewriting from scratch such a basic system is usually part of the polishing phase at the end of development.</p>
<p>Other additions, such as the introduction of three new player flags that determine if the player is in a situation where it is not possible to save, is driving a vehicle or is inside a vehicle driven by an NPC, are also, usually, additions made to the end of development, so it definitely seems like work on the project rumored to be Half-Life 3 is close to completion. The fact that work on HLX may be close to completion, however, doesn't mean that the game is going to be announced soon, so expectations should be kept in check for the incoming not-E3 season that will begin next week.</p>
<p>Besides the addition outlined above, the latest updates pushed for some Source 2-powered games added a few more files related to the yet-to-be-revealed HLX project, including support for meshlets, surface properties having attributes specifically related to vehicle-based gameplay, vehicle transportation for both player and NPCs, electrical interactions simulated system similar to the systems allowing for flammability of elements and material deformation, electrification of surfaces and props, improved sight and hearing system to allow the enemy to better detect the player, a wind system that can interact with volumetric fog and flammability-based items related to a fan system that should allow wind to move players, NPCs and objects and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="17 New HLX Leaks, it's Almost Here - HLX Files #11" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUj4iMRKGqM?start=3&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeing how much work is being put into the HLX project rumored to be Half-Life 3, there's no doubt that something is indeed cooking up at Valve. The game is rumored to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/">final entry in the series</a>, so even though its story hook may not be <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-main-story-hook/">widely appreciated</a>, at least fans will be getting a conclusion to the story, and not another cliffhanger that could be left unresolved for decades.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Nightreign – How to Change Skins]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-how-to-change-skins.1202397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> does not feature the same degree of character customization as other games developed by FromSoftware or other multiplayer-focused games, but this doesn't mean that it's not possible to change your Nightfarer's appearance. During your war against the Night in Limveld, you can unlock different skins for all characters, allowing you to alter their appearance and make each Nightfarer feel more like your own.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250530111235_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Changing skins, or Garbs, in Elden Ring Nightreign is really easy</strong>, and does not require performing any complicated operation or getting to a hard-to-reach location. To change the appearance of any Nightfarer, <strong>open the Roundtable Hold main menu, and select Change Garb</strong> to get transported instantly to the mirror inside the main hub that allows changing skins.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250530111240_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of your adventure in Elden Ring Nightreign, the only available skin will be the one representing the Nightfarers' vanilla appearance, but more can be unlocked by playing the game and completing Remembrance episodes, the personal quests of each Nightfarer which provides additional details on their story, and how they ended up in Roundtable Hold to fight the war against the Nightlords. You will also need Murk, the only in-game currency, to unlock them, but the currency is pretty easy to come by, as you are rewarded with a minimal amount even for Expeditions, so if you play the game enough, you won't have any trouble unlocking additional skins with little difficulty.</p>
