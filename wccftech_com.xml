			<p>AMD FSR 4 running on PlayStation 5 Pro promises to be more interesting than anticipated, judging from what a well-known insider revealed recently.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD insider KeplerL2 commented on the recent announcement that the next version of the AMD upscaler is coming to PlayStation 5 Pro next year, saying that the system cannot run the model that is being used by the upscaler to run on RDNA4 GPUs. Sony and AMD started working on the mid-generation refresh before AMD decided to move FSR to an ML model, and when the company made the switch, the PlayStation 5 Pro design was done with no FP8 support. As such, it will be very interesting to see how running the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr4-ps5-pro-2026-rdna5/">full-fat version of the upscale</a>r on the system will be achieved.</p>



<p>Those expecting to see games that support the AI-powered PSSR on PlayStation 5 Pro to automatically support AMD FSR 4 without developer intervention, however, may be disappointed. As far as KeplerL2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/ps5-pro-is-getting-a-big-upgrade-in-2026-%E2%80%94-i-asked-mark-cerny-what%E2%80%99s-coming-and-why-amd%E2%80%99s-future-pc-gpus-feel-more-playstation-than-ever.1685909/post-270585067">knows</a>, the current version of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler doesn't allow system-level DLL swaps, so there's a very likely chance that developers will have to update already released games if they want to take advantage of AMD FSR 4 once it becomes available for the system in 2026.</p>



<p>Besides offering the aforementioned AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, whose implementation has been hit and miss, depending on the game, the PlayStation 5 Pro offers other improvements that make it the system of choice to enjoy PS5 games at their very best.

			<p>NetEase Games made a lot of significant <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-exceeds-230000-peak-players-since-release-devs-tease-major-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Human</a> announcements during yesterday's Global Annual Showcase. Annual version 2.0 is now available and every player can claim 11 Lightforge Ingots for free by participating in the new events and completing tasks. Players can earn additional rewards through in-game activities, such as playing the Dreamland Wonder mini-games, rescuing the giant Chefosaurus Rex, and checking in daily.</p>



<p>The developers also launched a new PvE scenario called Endless Dream. It's a Nightmare-themed world filled with bizarre, psychedelic elements, such as CRT TVs and abandoned amusement parks. This haunted, odd world is filled with secrets waiting to be uncovered.</p>



<p>The entire world map is available from the start in Endless Dream. This strange world is a shattered reflection of the subconscious, divided into Dream Zones and Nightmare Areas. To survive, players must face supernatural environmental hazards and be wary of the new Confusion mechanic.</p>



<p>Those who wish to purify the Dream Zones must contend with their guardians: Light Dreamers, Deep Dreamers, and the most lethal of all, Eternal Dreamers. These new Deviants include Agony, a humanoid/transformer hybrid that emits electricity; Misery, a statue with flowers growing within its body that attacks by detonating itself; and Naivety, an adorable teddy bear with a haunted TV in its belly.</p>



<p>Once Human players have the power to shape the land in the Endless Dream. They can freely build offensive and defensive structures without territorial restrictions. Exploring the world and conquering its nightmares unlocks additional traits and influences the outcome through a real-time, five-stage dynamic progression based on how efficiently players purge the nightmares. This results in one of multiple endings.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NetEase also provided updates on console ports and a spin-off. When it comes to consoles, Once Human is set to launch in 2026 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, with the ports nearing completion.</p>



<p>As for the PvP spin-off, Once Human: RaidZone is set to launch on July 30 and it's all about combat. Players start with nothing and must gather weapons and building materials from the land. Forming alliances with other players is necessary, but only temporary. You must pick your allies carefully and be ready to turn on them when needed.</p>



<p>The entire RaidZone map is unrestricted, and players can strike each other's bases at any time. The Deviation Powers from the base game have also been reworked for the PvP experience, so players can unleash the might of Deviations on their foes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-switch-2-units-are-overheating-according-to-reports.1235811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to several <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/japanese-users-complain-about-overheating-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-and-noisy-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>, most of which are coming from Japan, some Nintendo Switch 2 units may be overheating. At least, that's what users are assuming when they see sudden freezes and crashes while the console's fans run at max speed in the vain attempt to cool down the hardware.</p>



<p>This happens with all kinds of Nintendo Switch 2 games, from the most taxing ones like CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077 to way less complex titles like Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma.</p>



<p>A few reports came in from Western gamers, too. Reddit user NitroWalrus732 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l4918o/switch_2_overheating/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/nintendo-switch-2-units-allegedly-overheating-users-report-issues-while-playing-cyberpunk-2077-and-less-power-hungry-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>I've had my Switch 2 display a message saying that the system was overheating and entering sleep mode twice now, both times while playing Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition docked. I was also running at 2k resolution which probably wasn't helping but this is still worrying. Anybody else experienced this? Wondering if I could have a faulty system or maybe TotK is just that intensive.</em></p>



<p>If you're experiencing similar issues, there's not much that you can do except clean the air vents and turn off the console for a while to let it cool down. If the issues persist, you should send it to Nintendo for repair.</p>



<p>Regardless of such problems, the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to sell extremely well. According to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-likely-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest estimates</a>, the hybrid handheld/home console may have surpassed 5 million units sold in June, although these are not official figures. Nintendo's own fiscal year forecast of 15 million units should be easily beaten by March 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>More details about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> ZeniMax Online game have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTU2ODYyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMTczNDI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVU2WjREV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qsy2COuNIZabsf38JG6uvZ2JOF4hCCs1hdYhMXpS9pw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">appeared</a> in a Bloomberg report, including that Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer had played it and loved it as recently as March. Here's the direct quote:</p>



<p><em>But Blackbirdâ€™s cancellation was particularly shocking because it had blown away executives at Xbox just a few months ago. During the demonstration in March, Spencer was enjoying the game so much that Matt Booty, the head of Xbox Game Studios, had to pull the controller away so they could keep the meeting going, according to two people who were in the room.</em></p>



<p>One of Phil Spencer's most endearing traits to gamers is that he is a well-known gamer himself. He has previously admitted to playing many online games, from Diablo IV to Fallout 76 and even ZeniMax Online's own The Elder Scrolls Online. </p>



<p>So, why was the game canceled? The report sheds no light on the specifics, leaving everything to speculation. If it's true that Phil Spencer himself had enjoyed his time with the game, it appears very likely that financial considerations - perhaps mandated from above - led to this outcome.</p>



<p>It's a shame, though, based on the details provided by Bloomberg. There were reportedly some challenges early on with the new engine, but those appeared to have been surpassed by now, and there were 300 developers on the project. They delivered the vertical slice in March to move to full production and tentatively ship the game (once codenamed Kestrel, later renamed to Blackbird) in 2028.</p>



<p>The game was reportedly a third-person online shooter not unlike Destiny (except for the different camera perspective). The setting was sci-fi with a flair of noir, and it put a big emphasis on movement, with player characters able to double jump, dash in the air, use a grappling hook, and even wall climb in superhero-like fashion.</p>



<p>Even the Bloomberg reporter, Jason Schreier, saw footage of the vertical slice and claimed to be impressed. This lends credence to the statement shared by Alex Tardif, former Lead Graphics Programmer at ZeniMax Online Studios, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the game was heading in a great direction. Needless to say, it all makes it even more weird that a company as flush as Microsoft would cancel a game that its own Gaming CEO, Phil Spencer, had appreciated, only because it would have been expensive to produce. It sounds like no project is ever truly safe from the axe at this point.</p>
