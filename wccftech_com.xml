			<p>The revival of Onimusha, CAPCOM's action series that hasn't seen a new entry in nearly twenty years, certainly surprised fans. During the latest Summer Game Fest 2025, where Onimusha: Way of the Sword was shown to the press (<a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-hands-off-sgf-2025-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ourselves included</a>), Italian website Multiplayer had the chance to speak to the developers and learn more details about the upcoming game, such as its linear level design.</p>
<p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will generally be structured around a series of sequential missions. There will be a series of levels and, as shown in the presentation, those individual levels will feature a relatively linear path with some secondary areas: once you reach the final boss, you defeat it and move on to the next mission. However, the content shown in the presentation was only representative of a small fraction of what is found in the Kiyomizu-dera level. Although the essence is linear, there is a lot of hidden content in each level.</em></p>
<p>One thing is for sure: CAPCOM did not choose to bring back the franchise as a reaction to games like Dark Souls. In fact, they said that the goal is not at all to create a particularly challenging game.</p>
<p><em>I can say without a doubt that we did not decide to bring Onimusha back to life because of the recent trend of particularly difficult video games. On the contrary, we want to ensure that as wide an audience as possible can immediately get into the game and enjoy it. The goal is not to create a difficult experience: we want to offer the right sense of satisfaction to both hardcore gamers and those who approach it from other perspectives, for example, to enjoy the story and setting.</em></p>
<p>It seems like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will focus more on the narrative than ever before, as the developers recognized it is a major way to open up the game to a broader audience.</p>
<p>So far, we only have a generic 2026 release window. However, with the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-playable-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be playable at Gamescom 2025, a launch in the first half of next year is not to be ruled out.</p>

			<p>Following the latest Xbox announcements and rumors, fans have been worried that Microsoft's next-generation console might be a PC-like device that may not even run prior console games properly. This fear stemmed mainly from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation </a>of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 and the subsequent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor</a> from The Verge's Tom Warren that Microsoft might be allowing third-party OEMs like ASUS to create their own version of the next-generation console.</p>
<p>However, Windows Central's Jez Corden has taken it upon himself to reassure gamers that backward compatibility will be retained at a hardware level without even needing emulation. Corden said as much during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x6c-7VRVxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Xbox Two Podcast</a>. Here's the relevant quote:</p>
<p><em>I can pretty much confirm - I'm like maybe two or three sources off writing a report on this, but the next Xbox is like 100% or 99.999% recurring running your console games, because I've seen that fear out there a lot at the moment, where it's like, oh my god, the next Xbox won't run console games. It's only going to be a PC. It's going to be like the ROG Ally. It's going to be made by ASUS, because Tom put in his article something like, "I believe Microsoft will still make their own hardware." I mean, they've said they will. The thing is, Xbox has said a lot of things in the past. When Tom says, "I believe they're going to make it," that exposes an issue with Microsoft's messaging. People don't really trust what they say anymore because they've gone back on their word so many times.</em></p>
<p><em>But, you know, which is again why I've been told by a bunch of people the next Xbox has the silicon for running Xbox One and Series X and 360 games natively. At least what's in the backwards compatibility program. And then everything you own on XB1 and Series X and S, those will all be playable on the next Microsoft Xbox. But I would not be surprised if there is an Asus ROG gaming all-in-one that also is just a PC, like Tom said. And to be fair, Tom was one of the first people, I think, who officially reported on the idea of third-party Xbox hardware. I didn't believe it at the time, but the more I looked into it, I was like, "Oh [ __ ] yeah, he's right." So, shout out to Tom for that.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, there were never any major worries that Microsoft would abandon its Xbox backward compatibility focus. It has been one of the few initiatives that has earned it widespread acclaim throughout the industry and among gamers.</p>
<p>Currently, the next-generation Xbox is expected to be launched in a couple of years. Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> fans the 'largest technological leap' between generations yet, a lofty claim to be sure.</p>
