			<p>Nioh 3, the third entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">action role-playing game series</a> developed by Team Ninja, has been announced today with a new trailer.</p>
<p>The new trailer, which was shown during today's State of Play presentation, provides a first look at the game's historical setting, the main character, who seems to be a fixed character like in the first entry in the series, and action-packed gameplay. While on the surface the game doesn't seem to be too different from its predecessor, there will be plenty of features that will set it apart from the rest of the series, such as a unique Ninja style in addition to the Samurai style, which is sure to make the experience deeper than ever, and the overhauled stages, which will be open fields offering more freedom and immersion. At the end of the trailer, it's been confirmed the game will launch in early 2026 on PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>While we will have to wait a few more months to play Nioh 3, it is now possible to try out the game thanks to a playable demo available on PlayStation 5. Considering the demos released for previous games, the Nioh 3 demo will likely give players a pretty good idea of what to expect in the final game.</p>
<p>Nioh 3 launches in early 2026 on PlayStation 5. No other platform has been confirmed, but the game will likely launch at least on PC at some point.</p>
