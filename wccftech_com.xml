			<p>As of the publication of this article, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is finally out on all platforms. It took 21 years and a near-cancellation to get this sequel, which is really more of a spiritual successor, but those who have been yearning for a new action roleplaying game in the world of Vampire: The Masquerade now have a new game to play. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review</a>, I wrote that the game, albeit flawed, is worth a look if you are into the setting and genre, although you're probably better off waiting for a discount. The other big reason to delay getting your hands on this game is that maybe, just maybe, the developers will be able to improve the optimization, which is currently dreadful on PC.</p>



<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is powered by Unreal Engine 5. However, it is pretty basic in its feature set. There are no ray traced settings to enable, and the game as a whole is far from the best showcase of Epic's game-making technology. Even the texture work is not always great, and the open world of Seattle is quite small by current standards. Long story short, it's not doing anything special.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, by now, we are used to reporting about Unreal Engine games having troubles with stuttering, but this is on another level entirely. As you can see in the gameplay video, the game stutters constantly while in the open world, whereas most titles that suffer from this issue only have that problem when loading another big chunk of the playable area. When you go inside interiors, the stuttering is slightly less prominent (but not at all gone).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I used NVIDIA FrameView and FLAT to better analyze the very same open world gameplay segment seen in the footage. The results are frankly astounding, and not in a good way. As you can see from the frame time graph, we have an inexplicable peak of 175 milliseconds, but even taking that aside, many times during the custom benchmark the frame time spiked beyond 40ms, meaning the frame rate dropped to 25 frames per second. It may have been for just a moment, but that's what makes it jarring.</p>



<p>The average frame rate is not at all a problem. With a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, settings set to Ultra, NVIDIA DLAA enabled and NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation set to 4x, the game averages 220 frames per second. The issue is that it constantly drops very low, then picks back up again, and so on and so forth, providing the opposite of a smooth experience.</p>



<p>By the way, this isn't like the case of Dying Light: The Beast, where Techland later <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-hotfix-patch-addresses-frame-generation-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to fix an issue with NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation that caused undue stuttering</a>. I actually played most of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 with Frame Generation turned off, simply because it couldn't really help at all with this game's stuttering, and the issue was still there.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to FLAT, the game was stuttering 20,29% of the entire time of the benchmark, which is by far the worst result I have ever seen. Usually, even the worst cases of stuttering reach around 9 or 10%. The analysis thus confirms the subjective experience: this is perhaps the worst example of stuttering seen in a long time in a PC game, and we've seen a lot in the past few years.</p>



<p>As if that wasn't enough, like I mentioned in the full review, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 also completely lacks support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays. This is just outright unacceptable for a game of this caliber that launches in late 2025. The first triple-A games started implementing HDR eight years ago, and nowadays most displays support HDR. Besides, based on what developers tell me, it should be really easy to implement it via Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I don't have much good news to share with regard to the technical side of this game. Like I said, we can only hope that some optimization fixes will be introduced with a patch, but I had already warned the development team after the preview build and there were pretty much no improvements from that build to the launch one. Maybe now they will take a closer look.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-discovery-is-up-for-sale-currently-reviewing-interest-%E2%80%9Cfrom-multiple-parties%E2%80%9D.1330681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-of-potential-alternatives-to-maximize-shareholder-value-302590176.html">announced that it is officially up for sale</a> and that it is reviewing interest and inquiries "<em>from multiple parties</em>." The announcement comes as Warner Bros is in the middle of splitting from Discovery Global, though that split isn't stopping Warner Bros. Discovery from taking a look at any offers it gets for someone who wants to come in and pick up the pieces.</p>



<p>WBD says the decision to publicly announce it is up on the shelf comes from the "<em>unsolicited interest the Company has received</em>," and that its board will remain open to all options, including "<em>continuing to advance the Company's planned separation to completion by mid-2026, a transaction for the entire company, or separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses</em>."</p>



<p>Basically, WBD is saying that if there's any company that wants the whole kit-and-kaboodle, that's an option. If a company wants to just buy separate parts of the company, like, for example, a company purchasing just the Warner Bros. Games division, that's an option. Or, of course, the WBD board could just not take any of these purchase offers and continue on its current course to separate from Discovery Global by mid-2026.</p>



<p>WBD is also considering "<em>an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. and spin-off of Discovery Global to our shareholders</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today's evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally</em>," president and chief executive officer of WBD, David Zaslav, added in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.</em> <em>It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets</em>."</p>



<p>This is not the first time the idea of Warner Bros. Discovery, as an entire company, or its separate businesses, has been on the shelf. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-sale-full-abandoned/">heard several rumours</a> in recent years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-considering-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-and-studios-acquisition/">including around acquisition interest from companies like Sony</a>, that some sort of sale would be possible, though nothing has materialized as of yet.</p>



<p>Specifically regarding the games division of Warner Bros., it's not unfair to say that David Zaslav and his leadership have absolutely mucked it up in recent years. Despite WBD's struggles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/">Hogwarts Legacy was a stunning commercial success</a>, and yet, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-might-be-making-dc-comics-live-service-game/">obsession with live service games</a> that plagues the triple-A videogame industry seems to have struck Zaslav and company more than most, with declarations that even having <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/">the best-selling game in a calendar year in your portfolio "<em>isn't enough</em>."</a></p>



<p>While making triple-A games has become more expensive, it would certainly be easier if the company financing those triple-A games also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-04-11/warner-bros-discovery-chief-david-zaslavs-pay-hits-52-million-as-board-changes-loom">didn't have to pay insane salaries to its top executives</a>. Not over paying <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/">for people who clearly aren't doing the best job</a> would also probably help retain the veteran, top-level talent that WBD used to have on its employment sheet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">instead of invoking mass layoffs and shuttering studios that have been around for decades</a>.</p>



<p>The whole statement from WBD today puports, like many of its statements, that this has all been done with shareholders in mind and that reviewing potential sales from interested parties "<em>is in the best interest of shareholders</em>." It's worth noting that what's also likely in the best interest of shareholders of WBD is giving Zaslav the boot, and installing a president who won't run the company so badly that it needs to go <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">through major restructuring</a> and/or beg for a saviour to swoop in and buy it while the franchises it holds licensing rights to still have value.</p>

			<p>Game performance on the ROG Xbox Ally X is seemingly held back by its stock operating system, as installing Bazzite OS can lead to significant performance improvements in select games, according to a recent test.</p>



<p>The test was conducted by YouTuber <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CyberDopamine">Cyber Dopamine</a>, who installed <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite OS</a>, which started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS on Steam Deck before becoming a great alternative OS for the system, on the newly released gaming handheld, and tested performance in two games - <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-rog-xbox-ally-x-bazzite-os-performance-tests">ROG Xbox Ally X Bazzite OS Performance Tests</h2>



<p>In both the second entry in the series developed by Warhorse Studios and the open-world game set in the Wizarding World developed by Avalanche Software, Bazzite OS brought significant improvements over the stock Windows OS, delivering the best results in Performance Mode (17W). In Silent Mode (13W), however, the performance difference was minimal.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Game</th><th>Power Mode </th><th>Windows Average FPS</th><th>Bazzite OS Average FPS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</td><td>Performance (17W)</td><td>47</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</td><td>Silent (13W)</td><td>35</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Turbo (35W)</td><td>60</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Performance (17W)</td><td>50</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Silent (13W)</td><td>38</td><td>37</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Even when the performance difference is minimal, the ROG Xbox Ally X running Bazzite OS still seems to come out on top. The performance in both games proved to be more stable, with none of the performance spikes seen under Windows. In addition, Bazzite OS brings some quality-of-life improvements over Windows in terms of usability, with a much better and faster sleep mode that makes the handheld much more practical to use.</p>

<p>Though its stock OS brings some issues, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful and capable PC handheld, and one of the best on the market.
