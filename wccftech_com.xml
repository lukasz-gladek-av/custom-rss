			<p>It's been announced today by Marvel Games and NetEase Games that a special Spring Festival event will be coming to Marvel Rivals. Since its release, this title has been widely successful, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">title already winning awards</a>. The Spring Festival will be coming to Marvel Rivals on January 23 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT, where a new limited-time game mode will be available for players to participate in.</p>
<p>This game mode is called Clash of Dancing Lions and allows players to participate in a 3v3 on a designated map to try and gain possession of the ball and get it over to the scoring zones that are on either side of the field. The first team to reach the designated score will be the winner of the Clash of Dancing Lions event.</p>
<p>By participating in the Clash of Dancing Lions event in Marvel Rivals, players will be able to get limited-time items such as the Star-Lord: Lion's Mane costume, nameplate, and spray. That is just the tip of the reward iceberg, as there is plenty more to unlock, including a Gallery Card customization event named Fortune &amp; Colors.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from the Marvel Rivals event, you can check out the Spring Festival trailer below, which showcases the Clashing Lions costumes. This includes Star-Lord: Lion's Mane, Iron Fist: Lion's Gaze, and Black Widow: Lion's Heartbeat. These costumes won't all be available to begin with, and will release over the following weeks.</p>

<p>In addition, Marvel Rivals will have a special Spider-Man 2 bundle, which comes with the Advanced Suit 2.0, nameplate, and spray, coming on January 30. This is to celebrate the launch of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC.</p>
<p>The game has received three patches thus far, with the first season well underway. Players also got to experience Season 0 when the game was first released, which had just under half of the content that Season 1 currently has. Already there are many players flying through the ranks, with the likes of <a href="https://esports.gg/news/marvel-rivals/shroud-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shroud considering creating a Marvel Rivals esports organization</a> because he likes the game so much.</p>
<p>Whether that will come to fruition anytime soon remains to be seen, but as the game continues to remain popular, it's possible that this will become a staple in the esports genre amongst giants like Overwatch 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, for example.</p>
