			<p>New The First Berserker: Khazan gameplay was shared online today, providing a new look at the upcoming action role-playing game in development by Neople.</p>
<p>The new footage, shared as part of <a href="https://www.gstar.or.kr/eng/gstar/gstar_info.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-Star 2024</a>, which runs from today until November 17th in Busan, South Korea, showcases an intense battle against Volbaino as well as gameplay set in Mount Heinmach, one of the first locations Khazan explores after being freed from imprisonment. You can find the new footage below.</p>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan has quickly become one of my most anticipated games set to release in 2025 after I tried it out during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/">Gamescom</a>. As I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/"> preview</a>, the Technical Closed Beta Test held last month only confirmed my positive opinion of the game.</p>
<p><em>The longer playtime of The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test also allowed me to appreciate combat more. While it is undeniable that the stamina-based combat system is very reminiscent of the Souls series, the Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nioh series influences are more prominent. For starters, the evade maneuver doesn't have a whole lot of invincibility frames, making it a little risky to use in close-quarter. The parry, called Brink Guard, on the other hand, is a much more effective defensive technique as it is generally easy to pull off and allows Khazan to stay on the offensive since there's a small cancel window at the end of each move that allows going into the guarding stance immediately, and it restores stamina while depleting the enemy's. An instant evade technique called Brink Evade, is also in, but it seems to interrupt the flow of combat when used to avoid attacks that could be parried.</em></p>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Today, British independent developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellion-ceo-egs-exclusivity-was-very-good-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebellion</a> announced the release date of its next game, Atomfall. This single player survival action game will be available starting March 27, 2025 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows PC and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, as well as on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Pre-orders are now live, with the regular edition priced at $49.99 and a digital-only Deluxe Edition priced at $69.9. The latter will include the so-called 'Enhanced Supply Bundle', which adds an exclusive pistol variant, metal detector skin and character upgrades.

<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Release Date Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_07x5LvQiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomfall is set in an alternate world where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscale_fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windscale</a> nuclear accident was much bigger and more troublesome than in reality. Five years later, players will freely explore the fictional quarantine zone, scavenging, crafting, trading, fighting and talking their way through a British countryside full of bizarre characters, mysticism, cults and rogue government agencies.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the main features:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Player-driven mystery:</strong> Unravel a tapestry of interwoven narratives through exploration, conversation, investigation and combat, where every choice you make has consequences.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Explore this green and unpleasant land:</strong> The picturesque British countryside, with its rolling green hills, lush valleys and rural villages, belies the dangers that await you.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Search, scavenge, survive:</strong> You'll have to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out alive.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Desperate combat:</strong> With weapons and ammunition in short supply, each frenetic battle will see you combine marksmanship with vicious hand-to-hand combat. Manage your heart rate to maintain a steady aim and ensure you have the energy to grab your cricket bat and land that killer blow.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Green and unpleasant land:</strong> The picturesque British countryside, with its rolling green hills, lush valleys and rural villages, belies the dangers that await you. Navigate cult-controlled ruins, natural caves, nuclear bunkers and more as you explore this dense, foreboding world.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Reimagining Windscale:</strong> A fictional reimagining of a real-life event, Atomfall draws on science fiction, folk horror, and Cold War influences to create a world that is eerily familiar yet utterly alien.</em></li>
</ul>

			<p>Infinity Nikki, the latest game in the Nikki franchise created by Infold Games is set to release on December 5, 2024. This news comes after extensive Beta testing on both PC, PlayStation and even iOS and Android. So far, Infinity Nikki is shaping up to be a huge success before the game has even become available, as over <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home?shortlink=ajkmiqf2&amp;c=925TrailerPR&amp;pid=X6_MKT_PR&amp;af_click_lookback=30d&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 million players have pre-registered</a> to play this upcoming game. If you want to see what we thought about the title, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-preview-glitz-and-glamor/">our preview of Infinity Nikki</a> here for more information about what to expect.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get stuck into Infinity Nikki when the game releases, it is set to release on December 5 on PC, PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android. There is no news about whether it will come to Xbox Series X|S in the future, but it seems that with games similar to this, it takes a reasonably long time to consider. For example, Genshin Impact has been widely available for a few years now, with the PlayStation 5 version of the game being released in 2021. However, Genshin Impact is only now coming to Xbox Series X|S this month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ja4dbzntYMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Infinity Nikki is the fifth entry in the Nikki franchise and sees Nikki go on an expansive journey with her companion Momo, bringing the franchise to PC and PS5 for the first time ever. Infinity Nikki utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to get a vast degree of realism and sparkle to the game to bring it to life. This title is helmed by Kentaro Tominaga, a game industry veteran who worked on Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, bringing that same magical feel to Infinity Nikki. Players will get to explore a vibrant world with a ton of activities to take part in, such as fishing, pet grooming, and, of course, fashion contests. While fashion is typically the forefront of the game for the Nikki franchise, this title brings quests, a fun cast of characters to interact with, and lots of ways to platform and navigate the world to find little secrets scattered around Miraland.</p>
<p>To celebrate the official release date of Infinity Nikki, a brand-new trailer has been released, which showcases the full Infinity Nikki theme song Together Till Infinity for the first time ever. This song is performed by pop singer Jessie J, who is known for creating hits such as Price Tag, Domino, and Bang Bang.</p>

			<p>Today, Orbital Studios has released a new Half-Life 2 RTX trailer to celebrate the coming twentieth anniversary since Valve launched the masterpiece sci-fi first-person shooter sequel.</p>
<p>As you probably already know if you've read our previous coverage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-is-in-development-by-a-group-of-modders-will-support-ray-tracing-dlss-3-rtx-io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX</a>, this is a remastering project that leverages the technologies of NVIDIA's RTX Remix and has the blessing of the original developer, Valve. Orbital Studios, a team of experienced modders, was founded specifically to bring this project to fruition.</p>
<p>In this video, Project Lead Wormslayer says:</p>
<p><em>Half-Life 2 is my favorite game. It's something I've been playing for over 20 years now. It was unlike any other game I'd played before. the whole game is packed with memorable experiences: stepping off the train for the first time and walking up that platform and seeing Dr Breen appear on the giant screen above you. The gameplay and the storytelling still stand up incredibly well, but we just wanted to recapture that sense of awe that we all had 20 years ago playing it for the first time. </em><em>RTX remix is the core of our remastering process. The original engine has very hard limits.</em></p>
<p><em>In Half-Life 2 RTX, we have fully ray traced reflections and refractions on water and glass and volumetric fog with cool lighting and shadows. We actually have full 3D detail in there, and it's all self-shadowing and reflecting, and it looks pretty stunning.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Half-Life 2 RTX | Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Tribute Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FZ49Ou8zAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the video isn't meant to share any kind of estimate on when we'll actually be able to play the remaster. As the developers point out, there are lots of assets to remaster, and despite the presence of over a hundred contributors, the team is still recruiting. If you think you can help bring Half-Life 2 RTX to life, fill out the form available on the official <a href="https://www.hl2rtx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>
