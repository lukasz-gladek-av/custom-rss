			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roaring-kitty-is-apparently-back-to-his-gamestop-pumping-ways/">GameStop</a> has sold its Canadian branch, GameStop Canada, to French-Canadian entrepreneur and McFarlane Toys co-owner Stephan Tetrault, who has also confirmed that the retailer will re-launch as Electronics Boutique Canada Inc., or EB Games Canada.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer of GameStop, Ryan Cohen, <a href="https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1891884823465103698">announced back in February</a> that he was looking to sell the Canadian division of the company, telling interested parties to email GameStop's mergers and acquisitions division, saying "<em>High taxes, Liberalism, Socialism, Progressivism, Wokeness and DEI included at no additional cost if you buy today!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stephan-tetrault-acquires-gamestop-canada-302446106.html">press release</a> regarding the acquisition, Tetrault says, "<em>This isn't just a business decision - it's about bringing something back that Canadians truly loved. We're going to build something special here, with community, nostalgia, and innovation at its heart</em>."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a report from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gamestop-selling-canadian-assets-ceo-wokeness-dei-1.7462542">The Canadian Press</a> put the number of Canadian GameStop stores at 203, though that was before GameStop <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/03/26/gamestop-close-significant-number-locations-report/">confirmed it would be shutting down</a> more of its locations worldwide, Canada included. The press release for today's acquisition puts the current number at "<em>over 185</em>" locations.</p>
<p>"<em>We want EB Games Canada to be more than a store,</em>" adds GameStop Canada president Jim Tyo. "<em>We want it to be the hub for gaming and fandom culture across Canada. This is about passion, and that's what's going to drive every decision we make</em>."</p>
<p>The transition from GameStop Canada to EB Games Canada will begin across the country in the coming months, including new store signage, a new website, and new branding across all social platforms. Canadians will surely have whiplash over the change since many remember that it wasn't too long ago that <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8066111/gamestop-eb-games-canada-rebrand/">GameStop sunsetted&nbsp;the EB Games branding in Canada</a>, with every EB Games becoming a GameStop.</p>
<p>Gamers have been lamenting the poor practices that GameStop perpetuates and how the stores have begun to sell more toys and Pop Funkos than games. It'll be interesting to see how Tetrault tries to turn things around, and if he can bring more gamers back to the retail store after many have turned their backs on buying from GameStop for years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ecco-the-dolphin-and-ecco-the-tides-of-time-remasters-and-a-new-third-ecco-game-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ecco the Dolphin creator Ed Annunziata announced in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a> that remasters of Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time are on their way. Once those are complete, Annunziata and the rest of the original development team will work on a brand-new third Ecco game for modern players.</p>
<p>The full Xbox Wire post focused more on celebrating Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and games made by Asian and Pacific Islander creators, with a short but impactful spotlight at the end where Annunziata answered a few questions.</p>
<p>When asked about what the future holds for Ecco, Annunziata did not mince words, saying, "<em>Me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Annunziata ended off by telling players to keep their eyes on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">eccothedolphin.com</a>, which takes you to a landing page with a countdown that will end on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2026, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Annunziata did not elaborate further as to whether that will be when the remasters release, or if it'll just be when we get our first look at Ecco's upcoming return.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652">Gematsu</a> spotted trademark filings from SEGA for "<em>Ecco</em>" and "<em>Ecco the Dolphin,</em>" which we now know were due to the series being brought back to life, and not just your bog-standard filing to keep the trademark.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ecco-metroid-orphan-of-the-machine-xbox-series-x-fall2020/">inspired</a> a number of games since its original release in 1992, with its focus on ocean conservation and marine life, and its meticulous and difficult brand of 2D side-scrolling. It'll be interesting to see how Annunziata and the team approach a remaster, if it'll be something akin to what Virtuos did for<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, with a big graphical overhaul while keeping the underlying game the same, or if it'll be more like a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-thing-remastered-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-from-nightdive/">Nightdive Studios</a> remaster, that keeps the original look and feel of the game intact, while adding a few quality-of-life improvements so it runs as smooth as possible on modern hardware.</p>
<p>If it's the former of the two, then that will also likely inform what Annunziata means when he talks about making a third game with "<em>contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-online-sandbox-mmo-to-launch-on-june-20-in-early-access-will-be-open-source/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, San Francisco based independent developer Clockwork Labs announced that their sandbox MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-is-a-community-sandbox-mmorpg-with-a-fully-editable-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcraft Online</a> will launch on June 20 in early access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454650/BitCraft_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>. Moreover, the game's code will be open source, allowing any user to contribute.</p>
<p>Tyler Cloutier, co-founder of Clockwork Labs, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The ethos behind BitCraft Online has always been about one core principle: collaboration. This is a massive in-game ecosystem, where we encourage players to work together to build towns, cities, or even empires. So to truly empower our community, it was important to ensure that the game would be open-source, allowing players to express themselves in their own unique way. We want to give our community not only the toolset to play within our world, but to participate in building it. Open-sourcing is more than just a technical decisionâ€”it's a philosophical one.</em></p>
<p>The game is set in a single procedural world, meaning that all players will play together, unlike in most MMORPGs. They'll join others to form communities, build cities and structures, and discover beautiful biomes.</p>
<p>The world terrain can be modified, too, allowing players to carve mountains and build their own legacy with a tangible impact on the land. As in any good sandbox game, Bitcraft Online promises multiple valid playstyles, from crafter and trader to explorer and monster hunter, or any such combination. Surviving and gathering resources are the keys to success. The economy is entirely player-driven, so the best merchants will thrive.</p>

By the way, Clockwork Labs said it could take several years before Bitcraft Online exits the early access phase, and they are in no rush to do so.</p>
