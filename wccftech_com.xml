			<p>Now that we are mere days from 2025, GTA 6 is starting to materialize as the proverbial elephant in the room, something that nobody in the gaming industry will be able to ignore one way or the other when <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it ships next Fall</a>.</p>
<p>Rockstar owner Take-Two is certainly eager to repeat the success of Grand Theft Auto 5, which became the second best-selling game of all time after Minecraft with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 200 million units sold</a>. CEO Strauss Zelnick recently spoke a bit about the next Grand Theft Auto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09uNAeQNdg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a video interview with Conner Mather</a>, hyping it up with a single sentence:</p>
<p><em>I would say I think it'll be extraordinary and worth waiting for.</em></p>
<p>Later in the chat, Zelnick spoke in more general terms about the GTA community's feedback, and he seemed to hint that Rockstar has prepared features and content the fans might not even have dreamed of for GTA 6.</p>
<p><em>We definitely listen to feedback from our fans, absolutely. You need to, in our business, and you're able to. But remember, the biggest hits are always the ones that are unexpected. Everything that we do has to be new and different, not derivative. So, by definition when people are commenting on something that is in the market, that means they're looking at something that was done before. Our teams are focused on what's new that you haven't even thought about, like, you thought you were anticipating this thing, but this is way bigger and way better and more exciting and more beautiful than you could have possibly thought of.</em></p>
<p>Looking back at GTA 5 and GTA Online (which just got <a href="https://wccftech.com/festive-events-make-a-return-to-gta-online-through-january-1-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update for the Holidays</a>), Zelnick revealed that Take-Two never thought the game would sell this much or that the Online mode would get more popular. In fact, it wasn't even going to have a virtual currency in the original plans.</p>
<p><em>I don't think any of us did. I think that we saw it as a really interesting add-on to the title. We actually originally had not planned to have virtual currency in the game, so it wasn't going to be an economic driver. It was relatively late in the day when we decided to pursue virtual currency because it was so long ago - we're looking back to 2013. And it wasn't an immediate success. You may recall it was pretty buggy at first. We had some trouble coming out of the gate because it was all new, and we were innovating; we were doing it all in real-time.&nbsp;It was like building a plane while you're taking off and then flying. It is an incredible, durable success and it continues to to perform many, many years later. It's astonishing and no, I don't think any of us expected that, but we also didn't expect to sell 205 million units. We never expected that. That was way outside of the realm of anything we contemplated.</em></p>

			<p>2024 saw the release of some absolutely fantastic indie games spanning a variety of genres. Indie games are where unique ideas flourish and bring something new and exciting to the table. This year saw some amazing indie games that even went on to win awards across a multitude of categories, speaking plainly for their excellence.</p>
<p>Here are all of the titles we've picked for Wccftech's best indie games of 2024. Truly, we were spoiled for choice. As usual, make sure to check out the other lists as they are released on the website to see what games came out on top this year.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>UFO 50</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ufo-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFO 50</a> is the third title to be made by Mossmouth, the creator of Spelunky. This game was released in September of this year and even received a 91 on Metacritic, with a User Score of 7.7. When it comes to scores, this is pretty darn fantastic. For those who haven't yet played the game, UFO 50 is a collection of fun and vibrant games that can be played single-player or multiplayer. They span a variety of genres, from shoot-em-ups, puzzlers and platformers. The goal with this game was to replicate the nostalgic feeling of an 8-bit aesthetic, and they did just that.</p>

<h2>Animal Well (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-well-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.6/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Animal Well was a surprising release this year, but a widely successful one at that. This title was made by a single developer and was published by Bigmode, a YouTuber videogamedunkey's publishing company, with his wife, Leah. This wacky game went on to perform incredibly well, with vibrant and surreal aesthetics as you explore an interconnected labyrinth, collect items and platforms, and do your best to survive. Below is an excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's review.</p>
<p><em>For such a tiny pixelated world, Animal Well is overflowing with secrets. Merely acquiring a new upgrade tool opens the floodgates of possibilities for exploration. As players explore the depths of the well, one of the recurring collectibles to discover comes by way of eggs, of which there are 64 in total to collect. Collecting certain thresholds of eggs rewards the player with various new tools, including the ability to leave hint stamps or draw lines on the in-game map. If it weren’t for these tools, I probably would have been at a loss for some of these eggs where I could see something clearly amiss in the room that I didn’t have the correct tool for at the time.&nbsp;</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Balatro</h2>
<p>Balatro has taken the world by storm. Even for people who have never played a game of poker in their lives, this has become a favorite for many people across the globe. It's widely accessible on every platform and serves as a great time sink. This game has been so successful that it even went on to win multiple awards at The Game Awards this year, with a nomination for Game of the Year, which is a huge achievement for an indie game.</p>
<p>Balatro was released in February this year, and it doesn't seem that there is any sign of it slowing down any time soon. People continue to play it, and the developer continues to add fun aesthetic updates to the game, with plans for other add-ons in the future. Looking at <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Metacritic scores</a>, Balatro received a score of 90, with a User Score of 8.2.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Hades II</h2>
<p>Hades was a huge success when it was released, and saw a lot of people fall in love with Greek Mythology via a video game. Hades II is no different. This highly anticipated sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on Early Access in May and has been widely successful since its release. The game has already seen a ton of updates and content added to the game to help flesh it out, and it's well on its way to being a fully-fledged product. Instead of playing as Zagreus in this title, players get to experience the life and story of Melinoe, Zag's sister. It features a cast of different Gods and Goddesses to interact with, different weaponry, and much more.</p>
<p>Hades II was also on our highly anticipated indie games of 2024 list released last year, and it certainly hasn't disappointed thus far.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Thank Goodness You're Here!</h2>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here is such a peculiar game and is perfect for those who are looking for a comedic experience in their game. Released in August this year, Thank Goodness You're Here is a comedic slapformer, set in Northern England. The game is fully voiced, and features some iconic voice actors in the game to help set the tone.</p>
<p>This title received a 90 on Metacritic from critic reviews and a 7.6 User Score. While the game may not be for everyone, it's a pretty surreal experience and provides some great laughs when you need them.</p>

			<p>Roleplaying games are having a great year after year lately. 2023 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2023-incredible-tales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was absolutely stellar</a>, but 2024 is another year that will go into the genre's history books, not only because of the huge amount of RPGs released but for their quality as well. As such, this year, more than any other, it's really difficult to just pick five games over all the others, as the vast majority of roleplaying games released this year brought something interesting to the table, whether it was a new take on a classic formula, a faithfully remade classic or a new evolution of an established series.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a></em></p>
<h2>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">9.2</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Like-a-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The release of Yakuza: Like a Dragon was a watershed moment for the franchise created by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, doing away with some of the series' trademark features to join the roleplaying games genre. The features and mechanics introduced in the seventh main entry in the series blossomed in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, as the turn-based combat system and the class systems are better than ever, and they not only manage to make Ichiban Kasuga and Kazuma Kiryu's adventure all the more compelling and memorable but also the proper passing of the torch from the old protagonist to the new the game was conceived to be. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth serves as the real bridge between the Yakuza and Like a Dragon series into one cohesive experience. It’s the perfect sendoff for Kiryu and a passing of the torch to the plucky Ichiban Kasuga. In a lot of ways, Infinite Wealth builds upon the past with callbacks that series fans could appreciate. It’s a Japanese RPG experience that could only best be described as Ryu ga Gotoku Studio’s Metal Gear Solid 4 moment.</em></p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">10</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Following Final Fantasy VII Remake, which reimagined a fairly linear portion of the original game, there was some skepticism surrounding the second part of the Remake project, as attempting to replicate the huge scale of the Planet while also making it interesting was no easy feat. The development team, however, proved up to the task, delivering with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth an amazing game featuring huge open-world environments sporting a wealth of activities that spice up the experience and provide a distinct identity to each of the game's regions, an improved combat system leaning more into the action genre, and an incredible recreation of some of the game's well-known sequences with some twists that will be leaving fans speculating until the release of the third and final entry in the series. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say in his review:</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;<a href="https://ffvii.square-enix-games.com/en-us/games/rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon's Dogma 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-showcase-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 promised to actually realize Hideaki Itsuno's concept for the original game, an RPG set in a believable living world where player actions, both big and small, would have consequences, and in plenty of ways, it did, only not in the scope that fans expected. As such, the game is"only" an enhanced version of the original featuring great visuals, a beautiful open world filled with optional secrets, an engaging combat system that better realizes the combination of character-action and Monster Hunter series mechanics, and some very interesting systems, including the devastating Dragonsplague mechanics, that is only a few small steps away from being the proper sequel that everyone was expecting it to be. Even so, it's very much worth being added in our top roleplaying games of 2024 list. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/dragon-age-the-veilguard-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter different personal opinions, it is undeniable that in the past few years, BioWare ruinously fell from grace, going from releasing some all-time classics like Baldur's Gate, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and the original Mass Effect trilogy to launching games like the average Mass Effect Andromeda and the failed live service game Anthem. As such, the studio had a lot to prove with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and prove it they did, going back to their roots, doing away with ill-fated open-world and live service pretensions to present a tighter mission-based experience featuring an excellent combat system and impressive customization depth that should please the vast majority of the modern RPG audience. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say in his review:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Metaphor-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio caught the attention of roleplaying games fans since its announcement as Project Re: Fantasy back in 2016, but the long development team made more than a few fear that the combination of mechanics lifted from the Persona series and a fantasy setting wouldn't be working as well as most expected.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that was not the case, as Metaphor: ReFantazio is the first proper step forward for the formula introduced in the original Persona 3, rejuvenating it considerably while offering an engaging story and a compelling class system that gives players a lot of customization options. A dragging final part of the game is the only flaw of an experience that will hopefully blossom into a full-fledged franchise. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Those who harbor an innate distaste for the social systems and time limits of modern Persona titles will find no solace here, but those who are willing to embrace what very well could be the sixth Persona title in all but name alone will experience one of the most stylish Japanese roleplaying games of 2024.</em></p>
