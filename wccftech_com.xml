			<p>In June 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> from Tony Hawk himself that a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 remaster/remake had been in development before developer Vicarious Visions got merged into Activision Blizzard. Following that news, fans assumed they wouldn't get a new version of those games, but it seems like good news is coming relatively soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnCqKCNNJFs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to insider extas1s</a>, a remaster is not only in preparation but will also be shadow-dropped at the next Xbox Game Showcase in June.</p>
<p><em>A professional skater who is already featured in Tony Hawk 1 + 2—I'm talking about Tyshawn Jones, an Adidas athlete—has confirmed on the Breakfast Club podcast that a new remastered Tony Hawk game is coming soon. So far, so good, and everything's on point. This was mentioned by the guy on the podcast, and it leads us to something we've been waiting for. I’m talking about a codename at Microsoft, Project Chicago, which is none other than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4. We already have the 1 + 2 remaster, and now the 3 + 4 remaster is on the way, as this guy said it’s going to drop soon.</em></p>
<p><em>What I can pretty much confirm for you right now from this video is that it's a video game set to be released in 2025. And I know you might be thinking, "Okay, Álvaro, everyone says things are coming out soon," but hear me out—this one is actually scheduled for June 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available right after the Xbox summer showcase, which means on the Sunday showcase, they’re going to do a surprise drop. That surprise drop is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remaster. Of course, it’ll be available on day one in Game Pass, and you can also buy it on Steam and PlayStation 5. As for Nintendo Switch 2, I can't make any promises because I don't know, but this Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 is dropping as a surprise at the showcase.</em></p>
<p><em>I was just waiting on some statements from people like Tyshawn Jones to back this up. For those of you who follow the channel, I had the name 'Project Chicago,' but I wasn’t exactly sure what it was. Now, I’ve been able to piece things together, and we’ll remember this soon—well, maybe not that soon, it depends on how you see it.</em></p>
<p>Microsoft is making it a habit of shadow-dropping stuff. They did it twice at the January Developer Direct with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>. It's a solid marketing tactic, although, of course, rumors such as this one kind of take away a bit of the fun of a surprise release. Still, I'm sure Tony Hawk fans wouldn't mind if it turned out to be true.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-rumored-to-sell-video-games-unit-for-3-5-billion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pokémon Go creator Niantic is reportedly in talks to sell its video games division to Scopely for $3.5 billion. The rumor comes <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-%E2%80%98pok%C3%A9mon-go%E2%80%99-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit.1112859/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Bloomberg</a>, which cites 'several people familiar with the discussions'. According to the report, a deal could be announced in the coming weeks, but there's still no guarantee it will be finalized.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based developer started in 2010 as Niantic Labs, an internal startup within Google. However, it went independent in 2015 following Google's restructuring into Alphabet, Inc.</p>
<p>Niantic made its business in the augmented reality game segment for mobile devices. After their debut title, Ingress, they adapted the location-based technology to create <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-go-review-the-new-king-of-mobile-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon Go</a>, arguably one of the biggest financial successes of the last decade. By the end of 2016, the year that saw the game's original launch, Pokémon Go had already been downloaded over 500 million times. By 2020, the game had grossed over $6 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>However, following Pokémon Go, Niantic was unable to replicate that success, even when using other big intellectual properties. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-without-cute-creatures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</a> launched in 2019 but never really took off and went offline less than three years later. NBA All-World was even more short-lived, lasting only a few months (between January and June 2023). Some hyped games, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-world-of-heroes-is-niantics-next-ar-mobile-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MARVEL World of Heroes</a>, were never even released. Others, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantics-monster-hunter-now-brings-the-hunt-to-the-real-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter NOW</a> and Pikmin Bloom, were released but never really became successful. The latter game, for example, only made $44 million in revenue in the first two and a half years of its live service.</p>
<p>That's probably why Niantic is interested in selling off its video games unit to Scopely, which operates big mobile games like Monopoly Go!, Marvel Strike Force, Star Trek Fleet Command, and WWE Champions, among others. Scopely was acquired in 2023 by the Savvy Games Group, which is wholly owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), for $4.9 billion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-support-studio-director-shares-that-he-and-his-team-were-just-laid-off.1112481/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> that one of the teams working on Marvel Rivals for NetEase suffered major layoffs struck the industry like thunder. After all, this is arguably the biggest success of the last few months, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning an estimated $135 million in the first month alone</a> with a user base of more than 20 million players across all platforms.</p>
<p>Needless to say, fans of Marvel Rivals and just regular gamers in general did not understand what was happening. We immediately reached out to NetEase to get their statement on the matter, which just arrived. Here it is in full:</p>
<p><em>We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience. We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new superhero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base.</em></p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, earlier in the day, NetEase had sent out a press release and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video update</a> with new details on the next Marvel Rivals patch, launching with Season 1.5: Eternal Night Falls. This will kick off on February 21, introducing The Thing and Human Torch from the Fantastic Four as playable heroes. Additionally, a new redemption system will be implemented, allowing players to convert excess Chrono Tokens into Units. The second part of Season 1 will also include a new map, 'Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park,' along with updates to competitive mode, tournament plans, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Human Torch: Hottest Hero In Town | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ORBFXYlQ3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Human Torch will be a Duelist type of character in the game, adding an intense flare to every battle with scorching flames. When he's not busy burning Dracula's legions with flames brighter than the sun itself, he's soaring across the city to gather Chronovium and scavenge for parts of the Timestream Reintegration Device.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thing: You Know What Time It Is | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l44udAAD3Yc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Thing, on the other hand, will predictably be a Vanguard character. His story is well known: Ben Grimm originally signed up to be a pilot for his friend Reed, but he returned from the mission as a monster called The Thing. However, while beaming cosmic rays transformed his flesh, Ben's heart of gold still beats in his rocky body. As New York City plunged into eternal night, the Thing made it his mission to selflessly protect his home and lead missions to collect Chronovium by putting his piloting skills to the test.</p>
<p>NetEase also announced today that the recent in-client tournament, the Marvel Rivals Championship (MRC), maxed out its Faction registrations in North America. After the upcoming update in the second half of Season 1, this limit will be increased. There will be a series of Marvel Rivals Invitationals (MRI) set to kick off at the end of February and continue into March, paving the way for the upcoming championship.</p>
