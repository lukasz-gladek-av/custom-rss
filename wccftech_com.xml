			<p>There's no denying that Battlefield 6 has had a massive launch, one week into the game being on shelves. Even <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/">amidst issues for PC players</a> and progression frustration, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">EA and Battlefield Studios have acted quickly to address</a>, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">officially sold over 7 million units in its first three days</a>, making it the biggest franchise launch ever, according to EA. On top of that, a new GSD data sales report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-launch-sales-bigger">The Game Business</a> reveals it's already won a point against its ongoing and rejuvenized battle with Call of Duty.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/data-key-facts/games-sales-data/">Game Sales Data (GSD)</a> under Video Games Europe tracks software units sold for both retail and digital sales in regions across the EU, Africa, and Australia, and in its latest report for sales from October 5-12, it shows that Battlefield 6 was at the top of the charts for unit sales and revenue per GSD's tracking, with the latest entry in the long-running shooter achieving four times the launch sales of Battlefield V, and beating out the EU launch sales for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As The Game Business points out, last year's Call of Duty was the first one to be available day one to Xbox Game Pass subscribers, which does skew the launch numbers from that of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/">a year when Call of Duty was not available on a subscription service</a>. </p>



<p>That said, with Xbox seemingly committed to having Call of Duty as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">part of the list of premium releases Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers get</a>, especially since Xbox needs something to try and convince people Ultimate is worth $30 a month, Call of Duty available through Game Pass right away seems to be the new normal.</p>



<p>That's all to say that this is still a sign of just how successful of a launch Battlefield 6 is having, especially if it's already showing it can best the current standard of Call of Duty releases on the commercial charts. Of course, the launch of Black Ops 7 will be a greater test, since, realistically, there could be a chunk of Battlefield 6 players who've bought in just to get their fix until Black Ops 7 launches. Combined with the players who don't buy anything every year except for the new Call of Duty game, it's very possible that Battlefield 6 falls short of Call of Duty in terms of sales.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the GSD charts, EA (the publisher) held on to the number one and two spots in the units sold and revenue charts, with Battlefield 6 in first and EA Sports FC 26 in second. Behind it was PlayStation's Ghost of Yotei, followed by Little Nightmares III, for both charts. </p>



<p>It's only in the fifth position that the units sold and revenue earned charts differ, with Red Dead Redemption 2 making the units sold charts fifth place, and Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 making the revenue charts. However, specifically with Super Mario Galaxy, it's worth noting that digital sales numbers for Nintendo games are not available, since Nintendo only shares physical numbers.</p>



<p>Here's the full top 10 list for GSD's units sold and revenue charts, per The Game Business.</p>
