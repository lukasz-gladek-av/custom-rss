			<p>The use of generative AI tools in game development has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a major point of controversy within the video game industry. Some figures, notably, many studio heads and executives, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-ai-trained-human-scripts-more-natural-conversations/">are all for using generative AI in game development</a>. Others <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">don't think it's necessary at all</a>. While we know Epic Games chief executive officer Tim Sweeney <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">sits firmly in the former camp</a>, he has also weighed in on another aspect of the issue, the fact that digital stores like Steam require developers to disclose that generative AI tools were used in the making of their game.</p>



<p>Currently, games published to Steam that were made with generative AI tools must disclose their use. ARC Raiders, for example, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">includes such a disclosure at the bottom of its Steam page</a>, though with how forward Embark Studios has been about its use of generative AI, we wouldn't have needed the tag to know generative AI tools were used.</p>



<p>In other cases, though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">like the recently announced game Beyond Words from former Timesplitters and GoldenEye developers</a>, if not for the disclosure at the bottom, we'd likely not know generative AI tools had been used. And then there are those who still don't disclose its use, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-generative-ai-assets/">admitting it only after they are caught having used it</a>, or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lsx5lwmsmk2j">don't admit it at all, and quietly patch it out</a>.</p>



<p>In response to Unreal Engine developer Matt Workman arguing for the removal of generative AI tags and disclosures on storefronts like Steam <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1988991435358482621">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Tim Sweeney agreed with Workman's post, saying that having generative AI tags on platforms like Steam "<em>makes no sense</em>."</p>



<p>Not because those who care about avoiding games made with generative AI have to keep an eye out for the disclosure, and even if it's not there, keep themselves aware for any signs of it. But because in his mind, there will come a day when every game is made with generative AI tools. </p>



<p>"<em>The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agreed. The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>GenAI being used in "<em>nearly all future production</em>" might be what the future looks like in Tim Sweeney's head, but it's debatable that GenAI tools will catch on to such a degree. When Nexon's chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">claimed that players should already be assuming all games are made with GenAI</a>, multiple developers stood up to point out that they would never use GenAI tools for their creative endeavours.</p>



<p>Whichever side you fall on, GenAI tools in game development, especially in triple-A game development, are undoubtedly here to stay. So there will continue to be games made with these tools, and we could get to a point where the disclosures are removed because enough games are using these tools. However, it would be interesting to see if developers who are against using GenAI would respond by highlighting that they did not use GenAI in making their game. It would seriously put to the test what executives are saying, <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">that consumers "<em>do not care</em>" if something was made with GenAI or not</a>.</p>

			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has been the one bright spot in Ubisoft's troubled times over the last couple of years. Even though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">wasn't able to contend with Ghost of Yotei on PlayStation consoles</a>, the company's recent first-half year results report <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">noted that Shadows overperformed overall</a>. Despite that, however, and despite the fact that Ubisoft's original plan was to put out multiple expansions for Shadows, it now seems like Claws of Awaji, which was released in September, will be the last - and only - DLC expansion the game receives.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">IGN</a>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>, associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois confirmed that, at least right now, Ubisoft is not planning to do another expansion for Shadows that is on the same scale as Claws of Awaji.</p>



<p>"<em>Well, we live in a murky world these days. So, with the caveat that anything can happen in the future, cause as [Assassin's Creed] Mirage just proved</em> <em>and as the crossover stories from [Assassin's Creed] Odyssey to [Assassin's Creed] Valhalla before it,</em> <em>things could come up in the future</em>," Lemay-Comtois began.</p>



<p>"<em>But</em> <em>as of now, at this moment, for Year 2, there is no expansion on the size</em> <em>of Awaji that is planned, currently. We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but</em> <em>it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years. And whether or not this is the right way to go or a good learning, I think it's more of an experience we're trying with Shadows, to keep it small and reactive, to see how the community feels about it and react to it. The learnings that come out of that will be applied to whatever other projects we do next</em>."</p>

<p>Lemay-Comtois continued to explain that for Year One, the team's approach was to try and be as reactive as possible, but with Year Two, the team can slow down as it's not "<em>putting out fires</em>" anymore, and really decide what solid "<em>chunks of meat</em>" they can release for Shadows.</p>



<p>Listening to Lemay-Comtois, it sounds clear that Ubisoft shifted in its plans for Shadows. Though, as Lemay-Comtois points out, anything can still happen, it seems like the chances of another proper DLC expansion for Shadows are slim to none, and Slim is getting ready to leave town.</p>



<p>This directional change could also be due to the completion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's deal with Tencent and the finalization of Vantage Studios</a>. Now that the Assassin's Creed franchise is under the new subsidiary, it could be the case that everything about how the franchise is carried forward is getting some sort of re-evaluation, including the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
