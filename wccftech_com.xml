			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> feels way more restrictive than your typical soulslike, and many of its central mechanics have been designed to urge Nightfarers to explore Limveld quickly to level up and obtain as many upgrades as possible to be able to stand a chance against the Nightlord waiting at the end of any Expedition. One of the most restrictive mechanics of the game is the Night Tide mechanics, which effectively impose a time limit during Day 1 and Day 2. Once the Night Tide starts moving, certain parts of the map will essentially become inaccessible, as staying outside the safe circle will deal constant damage to the Nightfarer.</p>
<p>The fact that the Night Nide constantly damages Nightfarers in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> also acts as a sort of secondary limitation for Day 2. After defeating the boss, the only thing you can do inside the safe circle is to head over to the Spirit Shelter to get ready to face the Nightlord, so most players do so to continue the Expedition. What many don't know, however, is that <strong>there's a way to extend Day 2 almost indefinitely to get more Runes and upgrades and get better chances to defeat the Nightlord in Day 3.</strong></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250603131423_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike Day 1, <strong>Day 2 doesn't end automatically shortly after defeating the boss, and only does so when players enter the Spirit Shelter</strong>. As such, with the exception of the bosses roaming the field outside of locations like Castles and Camps,<strong> the state of the map remains the same as before</strong>. Churches will still feature Flask upgrades if they haven't been picked, undefeated mobs will still be out in the field, and all location bosses will still be in their place, waiting for you. <strong>This means that you can still obtain Runes and every other type of upgrade as if you were playing the game normally during daytime</strong>, only that you will have to constantly heal with your Flask, and use Sites of Grace, which continue to function normally even when inside the Night Tide. <strong>If you plan your journey properly, have the maximum amount of Flask uses, and use the Sites of Grace to restore your healing charges, you can continue defeating bosses and improve your character until you can clear the entire map, </strong>if the situation allows. And even if, by chance, you are killed, you can try again as many times as you like, as the penalties for dying at the end of Day 2 will be the same as those when dying during daytime, so you will lose one level and all your runes.</p>
<p>Employing this strategy effectively at the end of Day 2 requires some planning, excellent knowledge of the Elden Ring Nightreign mechanics, and a bit of luck, but not only can it be a great help, it can also make the experience even more thrilling and fun. Give it a try while playing solo, and it won't take long for you to see how viable this actually is. Seeing as this is probably unintended, the ability to continue exploring without a time limit at the end of Day 2 may get patched out, so make sure to take advantage of it while you still can.</p>

			<p>Though deeply rooted in the Elden Ring universe and its Lands Between, the Elden Ring Nightreign setting allowed FromSoftware to make the game a celebration of its challenging Souls series, adding content lifted from games such as Dark Souls 3, among others. As you attempt to survive the Night and defeat the Nightlords, you will surely encounter some familiar faces from past games developed by the Japanese studio like the Nameless King and the Dancer of the Boreal Valley, but the content lifted from older games is not limited to bosses, as by achieving an extraordinary feat, you will be able to use skins inspired by the Dark Souls series, allowing you to turn Nightfarers into beloved characters like Solaire of Astoria and Sigmeyer of Catarina.</p>
<p><strong><em>WARNING: Light spoilers regarding Elden Ring Nightreign's content are ahead, so avoid reading if you don't want any potential surprises spoiled</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/">Unlocking the Dark Souls skins in Elden Ring Nightreign isn't really complicated</a>, but it's far from easy, as you will have to <strong>successfully defeat at least four Nightlords</strong> to be able to embark on the Night Aspect Expedition, where you will be able to fight the game's final boss, Heolstor the Nightlord. <strong>Defeat the true lord of the Night</strong>, and once you are back in Roundtable Hold, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/"><strong>access the mirror</strong></a><strong> to check the Dark Souls skins</strong> that are now available for purchase, and unlock them using Muck.</p>
<p>While unlocking the Dark Souls skins in Elden Ring Nightreign can be quite challenging, the effort is well worth it, especially if you are a fan of FromSoftware games. We may never get another entry in the Dark Souls series, but getting to play as some of its characters will make the pain of knowing that their stories are done a little more bearable.</p>

			<p>This morning, FromSoftware <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780347576750367" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its latest game, the experimental multiplayer-centric Elden Ring Nightreign, has sold 3.5 million units in less than a week. This is already the second sales announcement in a short span after registering <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-had-2-million-players-on-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 million units sold on launch day</a>.</p>
<p>The Japanese developer also teased upcoming updates, some of which should be available soon:</p>
<p><em>We are ever grateful for your passion. But the Night is far from over. In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date. Thank you for your support.</em></p>
<p>Regarding Duo Expeditions, PC players can actually already <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-mods-framerate-two-player-mode-easier-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> a user-made mod while they wait for the official implementation.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has received widespread acclaim, although critic scores and user scores alike are lower on average than those of the original game. On Steam, around 73% of 42.1K user reviews are positive. Here on Wccftech, though, Francesco De Meo loved his time with this peculiar take of the Soulslike formula, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rating</a> the game 9 out of 10.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</em></p>
