			<p>Independent developer Loric Games announced the last-minute delay of the early access debut of its upcoming survival roleplaying game, Echoes of Elysium. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-early-access-release-date-loric-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to launch today</a>, but the developers ultimately decided it was not ready and decided to postpone the debut to next month so that they may fix the 'stubborn bugs'.</p>



<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Qih_8SwonFU?si=rz9bH_uYUB0-TweH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a video announcement</a>, Loric Games CEO Brian Johnson stated:</p>



<p><em>We've built something genuinely awesome and unique, and we don't want to spoil that with a couple of stupid crash bugs. We're incredibly proud of what we've created, and even more excited to keep building on it with our community. I want to first thank the entire Loric team for the insanely hard work everyone has put in. I also want to thank our community, creators, press, and testers for all the support so far. It's not just us over here grinding—it's an entire community helping bring this game to life. We have big plans for this game. Please be patient with us as we continue to pour our heart and soul into this world</em>.</p>



<p>We were invited to a remote press presentation ahead of the originally planned December 4 debut, where we learned more about the game. Echoes of Elysium centers on customizable airships, which are vital for exploration, combat, and resource harvesting as players navigate the bright, colorful world made of floating islands that the developers have consciously crafted to move away from the dark, dreary survival game tropes. </p>



<p>The game takes place in the titular Elysium, a shattered paradise in the heavens of mythic Greece, filled with soul‑powered clockwork beasts and a hostile faction known as the Heron Armada. The player character is a hero guided by the goddess Lethe, tasked with uncovering Elysium's past and resisting the Armada in an open‑world, story‑driven sandbox that is procedurally generated. Upcoming biomes include storm-heavy cloud areas with 3D mesh clouds and caves, allowing varied exploration.</p>



<p>Airship construction is fully modular. Players design layouts, place functional modules, weapons, engines, sails, and defenses, then pilot the ship in real time. It is possible to eventually field a small fleet rather than just a single vessel. Combat pits players against waves of flying mechanical enemies, fortified sky‑towers, and Heron warships, with upgrades and new parts needed to survive greater threats. The airships can be augmented through craftable statues, granting abilities like stealth or rapid transition between regions. They can suffer damage and be repaired or destroyed. Beware that friendly fire is enabled. </p>



<p>Combat isn't limited to the airship. Loric Games plans to offer a mix of ground-based and ship-based combat, with the goal of achieving roughly equal emphasis. Players can also customize their characters with archetypes such as warriors, pilots, and engineers, each impacting the gameplay style.</p>



<p>The core gameplay loop combines elements of survival and RPG systems. Players gather resources on islands, craft tools, weapons, armor, and ship components, and use them to push deeper into more dangerous biomes. But progression also comes from leveling the character, unlocking abilities, and upgrading gear. Echoes of Elysium supports solo play or online co‑op for up to six players, and all major activities, such as exploration, building, boss fights, and resource runs, are designed to scale and feel better with a crew sharing roles aboard one or more ships.</p>



<p>Beyond the airship, the game also features fun glider-empowered traversal. The developers claimed that the community's input was crucial to making it feel smooth and dynamic. Following the early access debut, Loric plans to introduce ranged weapons, grappling hooks for ship-to-ship combat, enhanced shipbuilding, and new biomes. Improvements to progression systems, character customization, and ship combat mechanics are also planned, not to mention more modes. Offline support may be added based on feedback, but the team believes that multiplayer co-op is where their game shines best.</p>

<p>Following the presentation, we were able to ask a couple of questions to CEO Brian Johnson. For a hands-on preview of Echoes of Elysium, <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-hands-on-preview-the-skys-the-limit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out David's earlier article</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Several people at Loric Games are MMO veterans. Is there anything that you're able to use from your experience in that genre in Echoes of Elysium, even though it is a somewhat different genre?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brian Johnson:</strong> You're right. The studio was founded by ex Mythic Entertainment folks, myself included. And then we've also added a fair number of people from Bethesda. I think actually the origins about why we chose to build a co-op game instead of a giant MMO kind of stems from COVID. We have people who have worked on games like Worm Online and Star Wars: The Old Republic and Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76. The challenge we came up with is that it became this, like, forever dream that we kept chasing. How many people can we jam into a region? And so we just kept doing that and it was fun. There's some definite technical challenges to it. But when I played Valheim with a couple of my friends during COVID, I remembered what I loved about playing online games.</p>



<p>I liked playing with my small group of friends. I liked playing in a world that I owned. Almost going back to when we used to play Quake a long time ago and we'd host servers and play people would join those. So, that was what drove us forward. Then we thought to ourselves, well, what can we use from our MMO days that really drives that and and what can we borrow from it? </p>



<p>One of the big things you're going to see is our content pipeline. In MMOs, doing regular updates is an important part of the experience and getting content to the game and making that content systemic in some cases. That's very much where we're going to be bringing to life here. So, we started with a platform first. We're a venture-backed game studio. So, we've been really focused on developing a platform that allows us to bring a lot of both narrative content, creative content, and new systems online rapidly post early access as we learn what our players do and don't want in the game.</p>



<p><strong>Is there some sort of endgame that you may be adding to Echoes of Elysium?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brian Johnson:</strong> Man, this is a funny thing. The answer is absolutely, and that might come in the form of PVP. um that might come in less of forms, but we do very much want to get to a place where you're in this sandbox, you're surviving your friends, and you could sort of continue to create the world and change the world the way you want to. We've even experimented with being able to use harpoon weapons to drag other ships, even islands around, and we're really excited about exploring that and seeing where it takes us.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and other global economic powers are having a significant impact on the production costs of various devices, including gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, which are primarily assembled in China. With the very concrete risk that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/two-of-the-biggest-dram-suppliers-are-skeptical-about-increasing-production/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the current massive price increases for components like RAM</strong></a> may cause console prices to increase further, Microsoft is taking a significant step to mitigate these risks by expanding production in Vietnam.</p>



<p>The evidence for this crucial production shift comes directly from regulatory documents. As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/foxconn-subsidiary-plans-expand-production-vietnam-document-shows-2025-12-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Reuters</strong></a>, Foxconn subsidiary Fushan Technology is seeking permission to expand production in Vietnam to produce up to<strong> 4.8 million Xbox gaming devices annuall</strong>y. This likely includes not only consoles, but also accessories like controllers and headsets, which all carry the same price increase risk as consoles.</p>



<p>Microsoft isn't the only one, reportedly. In a related document, it's revealed that China's Luxshare-ICT is planning to produce up to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4.5 million game consoles per year</strong> at a factory in Vietnam, starting from 2026. The brands of the devices haven't been confirmed, so it could be any of the three big manufacturers, as all are facing the same global trade challenges that have led to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">an unprecedented price increase of gaming systems, years after their debut.</a></strong></p>



<p>Amidst price increases for all components due to trade tensions that show no signs of easing and the increasing demand for AI data centers, mitigating the risk of price increases for gaming devices in any possible way is the most sensible thing to do for all manufacturers, not just Microsoft for its Xbox devices. </p>



<p>With the<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/"> <strong>next console generation looming ahead</strong></a>, expanding production outside of China may also prevent gaming systems from reaching exorbitant prices, which would take away one of the advantages gaming consoles have over gaming PCs, including those targeting the same audience, such as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">the upcoming Steam Machine</a>:</strong> affordability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has released the Fallout 76: Burning Springs update across all platforms. The patch updates the game to version 1.7.22.12, with download sizes of roughly 28.8 GB on Steam, 39.3 GB on Microsoft Store, 41.9 GB on Xbox, and 40.8 GB on PlayStation.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As previously covered</a>, it's a major free expansion for the online survival action game Fallout 76 that opens a new Ohio‑set region west of Point Pleasant, introduces the Ghoul from the award-winning Amazon Prime Video TV show as a recurring character, and adds a full bounty‑hunting system plus new public events and creatures.</p>



<p>According to the developers, Fallout 76: Burning Springs is one of the largest map expansions released since the game's launch in 2018, probably the biggest since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wastelanders-country-roads-take-me-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020's Wastelanders</a>. It is accessed by crossing the Point Pleasant bridge into a rust‑scarred, war‑torn area of rural Ohio, which was never previously featured in any Fallout game. The region includes new wildlife and fishing content, including creatures like the Radhog that can be adopted as a C.A.M.P. pet, plus new fish species and at least one “local legend” catch.</p>



<p>The update adds a new questline that begins when level 30+ players tune into the Ohio Distress Signal; this story centers on Highway Town, its Last Resort saloon hub, and the ruthless Rust King, setting up a multi‑update narrative arc that will keep players engaged for some time. The patch also adds two new public events (Gearin’ Up and Sinkhole Solutions); both are located in the Burning Springs region and are built around the new enemy groups and environmental hazards there.</p>



<p>The patch applies a broad pass to weapon balance, legendary mods (including some new ones), and certain enemy behaviors. C.A.M.P. budgets have also been loosened, as several decorative and functional items receive lower budget costs.</p>

<iframe title="Fallout 76: Burning Springs Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ_SER3SwSQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Arguably, the highlight of Fallout 76: Burning Springs is the new Bounty Hunting feature, which lets players pick up basic Grunt Hunt and harder Head Hunt contracts in the Last Resort. Grunt Hunts target 1‑star Legendary enemies that can scale up to 2‑ and 3‑star as the player successfully completes more hunts, making them a structured Legendary farming path. Head Hunts, on the other hand, put the player on the trail of named targets tracked through the Challenges tab, with unique cosmetic and item rewards tied to specific bounties. Bounty Hunting is essentially a major new progression pillar, designed to be revisited for long‑term gear chasing.</p>



<p>The hook is that the quest giver is none other than The Ghoul, the popular character played by actor Walton Goggins in the TV series, who did all the voice work for the digital version as well. In the game, The Ghoul is overwhelmed by these bounty contracts and asks the player to step in and help clear them as they appear. Fallout 76: Burning Springs is neatly timed to release just ahead of the highly anticipated second season of the Prime Video show (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due on December 17</a>), where Lucy and The Ghoul pursue Lucy's father into New Vegas.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milepost Zero</a> is closing down in the Skyline Valley region. The rewards that were previously available when protecting Milepost Zero caravans are now spread across the Wasteland. The developers reckon that Bounty Hunting delivers the same promise of on-demand content with legendary enemies and great rewards more succinctly and satisfyingly. They also teased 'exciting plans' for the Skyline Valley region.</p>

<iframe title="Fallout 76 - Season 23: Blood x Rust" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/70-xouZLce0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fallout 76: Burning Springs lands right alongside the launch of Season 23, Blood x Rust, featuring a new scoreboard themed around raiders, scrapyards, and Deathclaws. The board is packed with Raider themed C.A.M.P. items, workbenches, and décor, such as raiderized workstations, metal braziers, junk‑metal fences, and scrap‑themed prefabs, aimed at giving camps a freshly pillaged look. Multiple cosmetics and utility items reference the new Burning Springs content, including bounty‑hunter icons, Rust‑themed player titles, and props tied to the Ohio region's Dino Golf attraction.</p>
