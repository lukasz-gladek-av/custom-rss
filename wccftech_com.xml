			<p>Anchor is a new underwater survival game from developer Fearem, which essentially mashes the kind of harsher survival crafting that players love in Rust with the underwater setting of Subnautica to create a new experience.</p>



<p>Set in a dystopian world where a nuclear apocalypse has sent humanity into the ocean to try and find a new way to survive, you'll be able to join up with other players in the 150-player servers or lone shark your underwater journey as you try to survive on your own.</p>



<p>It'll also feature PvE modes for those who don't want to deal with the threat of other players on top of all the other dangers that come with living underwater, which include, but are not limited to, always needing to keep yourself breathing, keeping your shelter intact, and ensuring you don't become shark food.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/subnautica-abyss-gazes-back/">Subnautica</a> offered players something entirely new with its alien aquatic setting, Anchor keeps its setting grounded (and wet) with its own version of Earth's oceans. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of marine life, beyond predators like sharks, play a role in Anchor when it does arrive at some point in the future.</p>



<p>For now, the game is set to arrive on PC, with no word of a potential console release in the future. Though that can always change. Hopefully, we'll hear more about when Anchor is due to arrive soon, or at least get a chance to play it at an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest</a> event or something similar.</p>

			<p>A new Unreal Engine 5 feature pushed to the engine's main development branch last week could pave the way for significant Lumen performance improvements across the board and for the lighting technology to be implemented in Nintendo Switch 2 games.</p>



<p>As reported by<a href="https://x.com/DylserX"> tech artist Dylan Browne on X</a>, Lumen Irradiance Cache, a probe-based Lumen mode for lower-end devices, is now available in the Epic engine. Compared to the default Hardware Lumen, the new mode features less occlusion detail and worse reflections, but it's still a good compromise compared to having no Lumen at all, judging from the comparison video below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Lumen Irradiance Cache | New Probe Based Lumen For Lower End | Unreal Engine" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkLmUPJvhsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As the Unreal Engine 5 Lumen Irradiance Cache is still in a very early state, it is difficult to say how much low-power devices will benefit from it. However, things are looking quite promising already. According to a now-removed GitHub commit, which was captured before removal and shared on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-ps5-power-saver-mode-tested-a-green-initiative-next-gen-handheld-teaser-or-both.1335199/#post-146877265">ResetERA forums</a>, Lumen Radiance Cache speeds up the Lumen gather stage by 2.5 times for an overall Lumen Scene speedup of 1.5.</p>



<p>This lighter version of Lumen could finally make Unreal Engine 5’s signature lighting viable on lower-power hardware like the Nintendo Switch 2, even if in a limited form. At this time, games powered by the engine released on the new generation Nintendo console, such as Cronos: The New Dawn, don't feature Lumen, most likely because <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nitendo-switch-2-held-back-cpu/">the console's CPU&nbsp;can't run games with such demanding features at an acceptable performance level.</a></p>



<p>As even Fortnite doesn't run with Lumen and Nanite on the Nintendo Switch 2, it's clear that dedicated work had to be made on the engine for the console to support these hallmark features, which seems to be already happening with the implementation of this new Lumen option. Hopefully, it won't take long for developers to take advantage of it and bring Switch 2 ports closer to the other console versions in terms of visual fidelity.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-had-%E2%80%98massive%E2%80%99-retail-launch-in-the-us-biggest-since-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom.1335964/</guid>

			<p>Last Friday, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the latest entry in the ever-popular monster catching franchise, had sold 5.8 million copies in its debut week.</p>



<p>Now, Circana's Senior Director &amp; Video Game Industry Thought Leader, Mat Piscatella, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's retail launch was particularly big in the United States, where it registered the best performance of the last two and a half years.</p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A had a massive US launch at retail. Launch week physical unit and dollar sales of Pokémon Legends: Z-A were the biggest for a new physical video game launch since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom back in May of 2023.</em></p>



<p>It's not at all surprising that Nintendo games excel at retail sales performance. PlayStation and Xbox users have long since switched to digital games, but the Nintendo audience is different and still quite linked to physical units.</p>



<p>In Europe, though, the retail launch was a bit smaller. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pokemon-legends-z-a-captures-no1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Game Business</a>, which had access to GSD data, Pokémon Legends: Z-A managed to knock EA's Battlefield 6 from the top position but also registered a 28% sales drop compared to the debut week of Pokémon Legends: Arceus in 2022. Indeed, as noted back when the official sales announcement was shared last week, Arceus had sold 6.5 million units in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>Still, the game appears to have received the acclaim of fans and critics alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch wrote:</p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em></p>
