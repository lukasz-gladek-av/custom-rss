			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has announced that its latest adventure into the zone will arrive on PS5 on <strong>November 20, 2025</strong>, with the standard version available for $59.99.</p>



<p>We first learned that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl would be making the jump to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ps5-release-late-2025/">PlayStation last month</a>, with a short teaser trailer that featured some of the characters in-game vying for who could have the chance to sit down at the TV and play STALKER 2 on a zone-looking PlayStation controller. </p>



<p>Now we not only have a release date to look forward to, but players who are still looking to collect physical copies can rejoice that there will be a physical copy of STALKER 2 releasing alongside its PS5 launch. There's even a special collector's edition coming called the Ultimate Habar Pack, though per the <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/news/ultimate-habar-pack-update">game's website</a>, the Habar Pack won't be arriving until sometime "<em>in early 2026</em>."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this announcement came with no specific details on how the PS5 version of the game will run and what graphical modes will be available, nor are there any details about what experience PS5 Pro owners might be getting in STALKER 2, but there's still plenty of time between now and November. We likely just have to wait a little longer to see what kind of experience PlayStation players will get when STALKER 2 arrives in November.</p>
