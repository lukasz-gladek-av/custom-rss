			<p>South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> <a href="https://x.com/CrimsonDesert_/status/2018685912973242632?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that the upcoming open world action/adventure game <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> has been wishlisted by <strong>over two million users across all platforms</strong>. </p>



<p>It is yet another strong confirmation of the mounting hype behind Crimson Desert. It's been a while since the market got a fantasy triple-A open world game of this scale (<strong>the world is said to be twice as big as Skyrim's</strong>), after all, and fans can't wait to get their hands on the game after many years of development.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in addition to celebrating wishlist milestones, Pearl Abyss is still sharing little nuggets about the game to keep players hooked until the <strong>March 19</strong> launch date. Just yesterday, we reported <span>on an interview in which PR Director&nbsp;<strong>Will Powers</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank">discussed the extensive amount of content players will encounter</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> beyond the main campaign</a> in Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>Now, another interview featuring Powers has appeared on YouTube. This time, the PR Director <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dacjty4cYE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hosted by Luke Stephens</a>, who at some point said he felt the game leaned more toward Nintendo's <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> than CD Projekt RED's <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> in terms of gameplay dynamics versus narrative. The Pearl Abyss rep countered that <strong>Crimson Desert is actually squarely in the middle between those two open world masterpieces</strong>:</p>



<p><em>If you're going to do it a scale from one side to the other.... There's narrative driven cutscenes in there, too, so I don't want to put it on the far scale there because it's much more in the middle. In The Witcher 3, what drives you through that game is the story. First and foremost, that is a story-driven game. CDPR has created this immersive, amazing, story-driven world. We sit in between those. Is it more one or the other? It's literally right in between because you have that central thread that's pulling you through it, but then there's those narrative-driven like cinematics and everything that are very heavy story. But it's not like The Witcher 3 in the sense that CDPR's game is story, story, story focused.</em></p>



<p>Of course, that's not to say the game's overall quality will be comparable to those two. The Witcher 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild are <strong>two of the highest rated open world games ever made</strong>, only comparable to <strong>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong> franchises in this regard. Pearl Abyss would likely be happy just with getting relatively close in terms of critical reception.</p>

			<p><strong>Xbox</strong> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/03/xbox-game-pass-february-2026-wave-1/">announced the first batch</a> of <strong>Xbox Game Pass </strong>games joining the service for <strong>February 2026,</strong> headlined by a couple of major past releases and one new day-one launch for the subscription service. <a href="https://wccftech.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-gameplay-gamescom-2025/">That new release is <strong>Squanch Games'</strong> upcoming <strong>High on Life 2</strong></a>, while the other headlining titles include <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong>.</p>



<p>This new batch of games also includes a couple of titles already included in the service for players subscribed to the <strong>Game Pass Ultimate </strong>tier that are now available for <strong>Premium</strong> tier members. Once again, unfortunately for <strong>Essential</strong> tier players, there's nothing in this batch of games that increases the library of titles available to players on the bottom-tier subscription.</p>



<p>Outside of High on Life 2, the other two new releases entering the service this month are <strong>Roadside Research</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anime-inspired-life-sim-starsand-island-debuts-next-week-early-access/">Starsand Island</a></strong>. The former is a gas station management game where you play as aliens gathering information on humans while they fuel up their cars. The latter is a new life/farming sim, and both are arriving in the service as 'Game Preview' titles.</p>



<p>Other notable titles include <strong>Madden NFL 26</strong>, which replaces <strong>Madden NFL 24</strong>, as the 2024 entry is the only game leaving the service in this update, and <strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong>. It's also worth noting that, while <strong>Warhorse Studios</strong> has yet to confirm a major current-gen update for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ps5-version/">after a <strong>PlayStation Store</strong> listing let the cat out of the bag</a>, it seems like its arrival date in Game Pass, February 13, 2026, will likely be the day the new version is released.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining Game Pass in this initial February 2026 batch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy II - February 3 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>
