			<p>Anchor is a new underwater survival game from developer Fearem, which essentially mashes the kind of harsher survival crafting that players love in Rust with the underwater setting of Subnautica to create a new experience.</p>



<p>Set in a dystopian world where a nuclear apocalypse has sent humanity into the ocean to try and find a new way to survive, you'll be able to join up with other players in the 150-player servers or lone shark your underwater journey as you try to survive on your own.</p>



<p>It'll also feature PvE modes for those who don't want to deal with the threat of other players on top of all the other dangers that come with living underwater, which include, but are not limited to, always needing to keep yourself breathing, keeping your shelter intact, and ensuring you don't become shark food.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/subnautica-abyss-gazes-back/">Subnautica</a> offered players something entirely new with its alien aquatic setting, Anchor keeps its setting grounded (and wet) with its own version of Earth's oceans. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of marine life, beyond predators like sharks, play a role in Anchor when it does arrive at some point in the future.</p>



<p>For now, the game is set to arrive on PC, with no word of a potential console release in the future. Though that can always change. Hopefully, we'll hear more about when Anchor is due to arrive soon, or at least get a chance to play it at an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest</a> event or something similar.</p>
