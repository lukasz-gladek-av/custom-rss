			<p>Sandfall Interactive announced that its debut smash-hit RPG, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, has hit <strong>3.3 million copies sold</strong>, 33 days after the game launched.</p>
<p>"<em>We couldn't make that up</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892">post on X</a> from the game's official account reads. "<em>Another entry on the long list of surreal moments that your support has made real. Thank you all.</em>"</p>
<p>It's the latest sign that the stars definitely aligned to help Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 reach the audience of players looking for RPG's like Clair Obscur. Even the fact that the week it launched, it did so days after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered arrived, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">ended up helping out Clair Obscur instead of overshadowing it</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond not getting overlooked by an Oblivion remaster, the other major aspect of this milestone is the fact that, like Oblivion Remastered, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also launched into Xbox Game Pass, so millions of players didn't necessarily need to buy it to check it out. All in all, for a small team like Sandfall Interactive, they couldn't have asked for a better launch for their debut game.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur</a>, he had nothing but praise for it, writing:</p>
<p>"<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive's first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself</em>."</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/f1-25-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-ray-reconstruction-path-tracing/">announced</a> the latest batch of games that have added support for its DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen and DLSS Super Resolution technology, including F1 25, which launches today for those with paid early access, and with support for DLSS 4.</p>
<p>Seven games in total officially added support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation: F1 25, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everspace-2-titans-qa-rockfish-talks-about-the-upcoming-dlc-and-more/">Everspace 2</a>, Storror Parkour Pro, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-complete-ray-tracing-8k/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a>, Torque Drift 2, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-goes-into-early-access-on-pc-on-march-20/">Wreckfest 2</a>. Two more games added support for DLSS Super Resolution: <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-is-out-now-on-pc-and-mobile/">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>.</p>
<p>Players jumping into F1 25 today or in a few days when it launches for everyone who didn't pay to play a few days early will also be able to take advantage of DLSS Ray Reconstruction for a more stable gameplay experience without losing the graphical impact that comes with ray-tracing, and those who have one of the GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards from NVIDIA will be able to take full advantage of DLSS 4.</p>
<p>And just in time for HBO's The Last of Us concluding its second season, players can jump into The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC with DLSS 4 support, which was missed when we checked it out for its PC launch at the beginning of last month. Though to the credit of Naughty Dog and Nixxes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo still found it to be a smooth experience</a> at launch. Now with DLSS 4 support, it should be even smoother for players looking to compare and contrast how the story is portrayed in HBO's premiere TV version of it versus Naughty Dog's original game.</p>
<p>The seven games announced today now join the more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/">125 games and applications</a> that support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation technology, a milestone that NVIDIA recently confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Build a Rocket Boy has debuted a new trailer for its upcoming game, MindsEye, ahead of its release in just a couple of weeks, at the time of writing on<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/"> June 10, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The new trailer is a six-and-a-half-minute 'introduction' to MindsEye, showcasing plenty of details about the game's story, some new looks at gameplay, and digging a bit into the post-launch content and the level-creation tools that are featured in the PC version of the game.</p>
<p>MindsEye's creation tool gives PC players access to the game's assets, and according to the trailer, allows players to create "<em>anything</em>" they can think of, and touts that Build a Rocket Boy is "<em>passionate about democratizing video game development</em>."</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Regarding MindsEye's roadmap, the game will launch with its single-player campaign and several different additional gameplay scenarios, with more to be added later in the year during the summer, fall, and winter. There's also a 'premium pass' that players can purchase that'll provide what Build a Rocket Boy classifies as 'extra' missions, along with each of the planned free updates and cosmetic packs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>We're beyond excited to bring MindsEye to players worldwide,</em>" said Leslie Benzies, former Rockstar producer who worked on the Grand Theft Auto series since GTA III, now founder of Build a Rocket Boy and director of MindsEye, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Our team has poured their passion and dedication into creating MindsEye and the Game Creation System for almost a decade, to deliver players an unforgettable story campaign and empower them to craft their own world-class experiences. Continuous updates and fresh new content from our studio ensure MindsEye is an endless adventure.</em>"</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how players react to MindsEye when it launches. There's pedigree behind the game due to Benzies' history, and everything we've seen in gameplay trailers so far looks incredibly flashy.</p>
<p>But recent previews haven't been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">too high on what was shown</a>, and as recently as this past weekend, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a> reviews from former and current employees are making the rounds on <a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1926754035144536233">social media</a> describing Build a Rocket Boy as bad place to work, with some reviews telling developers to "<em>avoid</em>" the studio "<em>at all costs</em>," others call out Benzies directly for his poor management of the studio, and many describe Build a Rocket Boy to be a toxic place to work.</p>
<p>Realistically, Build a Rocket Boy wouldn't be the first, nor would it be the last game studio to have poor internal working conditions and is still able to release an amazing game. So all this concern about the poor previews and bad internal conditions at the studio could be quickly forgotten by players as they're enamored with the next-best-game of 2025. We'll see what happens on June 10.</p>
