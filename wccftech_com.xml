The highly anticipated metroidvania will launch on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>The waiting is almost over, but almost more importantly, the anticipation and disappointment at every major videogame related event that has taken place in the last six years is actually over, and we can now sit back and relax without having to wonder if Hollow Knight Silksong will appear at The Game Awards this year, or at Summer Game Fest next year, and so on.</p>



<p>The special announcement hosted by Team Cherry today was watched live by more than a quarter of a million people, which further shows how excited fans of the first game are to see something new from Team Cherry.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the announcement didn't disappoint, with even more gameplay showing off the wide variety of bosses, enemies, and new areas you'll be able to explore in this hand-painted adventure.</p>
