			<p>Straight4 Studios has announced that its upcoming sim racing game, Project Motor Racing, will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in Fall 2025.</p>
<p>At launch, Project Motor Racing will feature more than 70 vehicles across 10 racing classes and 27 track layouts. Straight4 Studios also showcased some gameplay in a new trailer released today, showing off some early, but still impressive, footage.</p>
<p>The trailer also included a cameo from professional racer Derek Bell, playing the game with a full <a href="https://wccftech.com/genesis-announces-the-seaborg-400-racing-wheel-controller/">racing sim setup</a>. It's a clear sign of the kinds of players that Project Motor Racing is targeting: the sim racing fan who went all-out to play their favorite kinds of games in the best way possible.</p>

<p>The upcoming sim racer will have the expected modes, including a single-player career mode and an online multiplayer mode, which will feature leaderboards and "<em>full race weekends</em>" for a more in-depth multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>While Project Motor Racing is being developed by Straight4 Studios, it's being built on publisher Giants Software's own GIANTS game engine. For chief executive officer of Giants Software, Christian Ammann, it's a new step forward for the studio and the beginning of a new era.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">This is the next gear for GIANTS Software: Moving forward, we will be recognized not only as the creators of Farming Simulator but also as the publisher of Project Motor Racing,</span></em>" Ammann said in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Our strong collaboration with Straight4 gives me full confidence that we’ll deliver an exceptional experience for all sim racing enthusiasts!</span></em>"</p>
<p>Straight4 Studios' chief executive officer, Ian Bell, added, "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">This is not about driving. It’s about racing. With our streamlined approach and what we consider to be the most authentic handling model we’ve ever created, Project Motor Racing is both a nod to our genre’s rich legacy and a big step into the next era of simulation.</span></em>"</p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is unlikely to use the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering like Oblivion Remastered does, as it would do little to address some of the most common Creation Engine complaints, like the fragmented game world.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry responded to a fan's question about whether The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a test for the next entry in the series. They highlighted the possibility is definitely there, as other studios have done something similar in the past, essentially making Unreal Engine their own, like Housemarque with Returnal.</p>
<p>Still, it seems unlikely that The Elder Scrolls VI will use Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, as the Epic engine would not solve any of the most significant issues of the Creation Engine by itself. As highlighted by Oblivion Remastered, the Unreal Engine 5 was still limited by the Gamebryo engine powering the rest of the game, and the game world was still as fragmented as it was in the original. At the same time, rendering was not exactly an issue in Starfield, and with the Creation Engine likely getting rendering improvements for The Elder Scrolls VI, having Unreal Engine 5 rendering would only serve to delay the game further, complicate development and potentially add performance issues, as Oblivion Remastered is extremely heavy and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">runs poorly on pretty much everything that isn't a top end machine with frame generation on top.</a></p>

<p>With The Elder Scrolls VI still far from release, the launch of Oblivion Remastered allows players to return to Tamriel ahead of the launch of the next entry in the series. Despite performance issues and some visual changes, the remaster is a game worth experiencing, keeping the original's magic intact, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>. The game is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
