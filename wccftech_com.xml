            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/blades-of-fire-5-things-to-know-to-enjoy-the-game-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although Blades of Fire is not that different from other action-adventure games like the modern God of War games and challenging action role-playing games in the vein of FromSoftware's Souls series, playing the game developed by MercurySteam the same way as these games will result in a frustrating experience. As such, learning some of the gameplay systems' intricacies will go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>As you are starting out your quest to kill the Queen, however, you won't get many opportunities to delve deeper into some of the game's unique mechanics. Still, there are a few things to know right at the start of the adventure that can make Blades of Fire way more enjoyable.</p>
<h2>Manage your Weapons wisely</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.54.15.59-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the game, your weapon selection will be limited, and you may end up relying on a single weapon that seems to be doing well. What you should be doing, however, is start getting used to the game's weapon mechanics, as you will soon encounter an enemy that your favorite weapon may not be able to damage. As such, you should have on hand multiple weapons that allow you to deal blunt, slashing, and piercing damage. While penetration values may not be too important at the start, you should always make sure they are as high as possible, so bringing multiple weapons that deal the same type of damage may be beneficial in the end, as it will make sure the penetration value of any specific weapon doesn't get too low to the point that you will need to sharpen your weapon, reducing durability.</p>
<h2>Make Use of Your Broken Weapons</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.55.19.67-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter how good you are at weapon management in Blades of Fire, there will come a time when a weapon breaks and cannot be repaired. In the first few hours of the game, your only option will be to recycle the weapon to get back some of the materials you used to forge it, but as soon as you meet Glinda, you will have another option to use your broken weapons to get items. After meeting the character, you will unlock the Reputation system, which makes weapons become more valuable the more enemies they kill. Weapons with high enough reputation can be offered to Glinda to obtain a lot of units of any material at once, which is a big help later in the game when the rarest Steel requires a lot of materials. As such, if you need a lot of a specific material, the better option is to offer a broken weapon to Glinda. Otherwise, recycling could be the way to go if you need multiple materials.</p>
<h2>Always finish your enemies with Heavy Attacks</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.45.56.14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides unleashing light attacks, Aran can perform powerful heavier attacks by holding down any of the four attack buttons. While these attacks are slower than the regular light attacks, they are considerably more powerful and can dismember enemies if they deplete their HP bar. This is extremely important to keep in mind against bosses with multiple health bars, as it is possible to temporarily disable some of their abilities by using heavy attacks when they are stunned, but it's something to keep in mind for regular enemies as well. Finishing enemies with a heavy attack makes the weapon earn increased Reputation, which is something you should always do to obtain large quantities of materials as outlined above. Durability heavily decreases with these attacks, however, so you should always strive to hit a balance to avoid finding yourself without any usable weapon at hand.</p>
<h2>Learn the Forging Mechanics</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.52.31.28-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The weapon forging mechanics in Blades of Fire are extremely important, and fully understanding them can really make a difference, no matter where you are in the game. While picking the right Steel or Wood is a straightforward process, as the game highlights how much the weapon changes depending on your selection, the actual forging of the weapons is not as simple. As a general rule, you want to be able to repair your weapons as much as possible, so you should be striving for the highest possible quality at all times. Resources are limited, and can take a while to farm, so you want a weapon forged with the best possible Steel to last you as long as possible.</p>
<h2>Don't be Afraid to Lower the Difficulty</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bladesoffire-Screenshot-2025.05.19-12.55.34.80-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As I highlighted in my review, Blades of Fire's level design gets complex very easily, and with so many multiple paths and shortcuts, it is very easy to get lost. There's a way, however, to highlight where to go for the next story objective in the main options menu, but only if you are playing the game at the Iron or Bronze difficulties. Still, you can use this waypoint system even in Steel difficulty by lowering the difficulty, selecting the Show Objective option, and increasing it again. You will not earn a specific achievement by doing this, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff for a first playthrough, in my opinion, as exploration can really get frustrating without proper guidance, especially at the start of the adventure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Bungie developers are speaking out about the problems Bungie is facing internally, and all signs point to leadership and structural issues following Sony's acquisition of Bungie, and a human resources department, or at least, a single member of that department, covering up internal issues of harassment for personal gain on their exit from the studio.</p>
<p>Internal issues at Bungie, unfortunately, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/">aren't anything new</a>, but this latest slew of details comes from Destin Legarie, who published a video on his YouTube channel after speaking to former Bungie developers. Many of the comments are quite damning, and paint the picture of a Bungie that is not the same studio it once was when every first-person shooter fan on the planet couldn't wait to see what they would do next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Inside Bungie’s Decline: Former Devs Speak Out" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No direct names were mentioned in the video as to who the former Bungie employees were calling out, everything was kept in more general terms with just the word 'leadership' being used to represent Bungie's top brass.</p>
<p>All of this came about after Bungie was caught using artwork and/or art assets from another artist without their permission or crediting them for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">the fourth time in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed</em>," a former Bungie developer told Legarie. Another quote went further, saying "<em>Bungie's problem stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture.</em>"</p>
<p>Another quote reads "<em>Internal language shifted from 'studio,' 'games,' and 'players,' to 'company,' 'product,' and 'customers,' during the Sony acquisition,</em>" highlighting how the studio has seemingly shifted its viewpoint that making good games for players to enjoy is no longer the ultimate goal, and is instead making games that make <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/21/more-bungie-reveals-from-destiny-2-subscriptions-to-eververse-demands/">as much money as possible</a>.</p>
<p>There have been negative stories about internal problems at the Destiny 2 developer for the past couple of years, and morale certainly can't be helped by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">layoffs the studio has suffered</a>. All of leadership might be part of the problem, which is what seems to be the speculation in this video, but as Legarie points out, the buck has to stop somewhere, and in the case of Bungie, that's with chief executive officer Pete Parsons.</p>
<p>It's extremely unfortunate that the studio behind Halo and Destiny, two of the biggest shooter franchises in video game history, is facing all of this, and could see its end due to its allegedly greedy and inconsiderate leaders who have lost the plot, and the fact that if not for the studio making games that people wanted to play in the first place, none of them would be where they are.</p>

			<p>Ara: History Untold's upcoming DLC, Untold Scenarios, will arrive on PC this coming June 18, 2025, developer Oxide Games has announced.</p>
<p>The expansion will be available for $9.99 USD, and will include several scenarios that blend historical events with alternative history to create 'what-if' scenarios for "<em>more event-driven strategic challenges</em>," according to a press release for the upcoming expansion.</p>
<p>While Ara: History Untold is playable through Xbox Game Pass PC, that's only for the base game. If you want to play any of these new scenarios, you'll need to grab the DLC on its own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ara: History Untold | Dev Q&amp;A | Ep. 9" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCsXUG3ZsyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ara: History Untold arrived on PC and through Game Pass PC last September, and overall arrived as "<em>a mixed bag,"&nbsp;</em>according to our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/">reviewer, Chris Wray</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Ara: History Untold is the perfect example of a mixed bag. Some genuinely great ideas, but some negatives are trying to counterbalance them. Focusing on supply chains and adding real to is an excellent idea, but the implementation has left the game with significant micromanagement, which could put people off. The region and city development systems are on a whole new level and could be how 4X games go in the future, but the AI manages to mess it</em> up," he wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Ara: History Untold is a highly ambitious 4X game that looks to branch out and add even more depth to an already detailed genre. In many ways, it succeeds, bringing in a map and city-building system that far surpasses others in the genre and successfully interlinking practically every area. However, with some successes come issues, with the added depth in the supply chain making it a bit of a micromanagement nightmare; it tries to alleviate some of these issues with a user-friendly UI, but it could be a sticking point for some.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insider-suggests-a-playstation-event-won%E2%80%99t-happen-until-september-%E2%80%93-rumor.1195656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/insider-suggests-a-playstation-event-wont-happen-until-september-rumor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In part of a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-reliable-insider-suggest-sonys-next-event-will-be-in-september-skipping-not-e3-season.1195542/">ResetEra</a> thread, insider John Harker suggests that Sony and PlayStation won't hold an event this summer, and that instead players should look to September for when the next big event, whether a showcase or State Of Play, should happen.</p>
<p>Responding to a different user who was speculating that there would be a September event, Harker, in agreement, responded, "<em>Indeed</em>." PlayStation has commonly hosted events between late August and September, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if there was an event in that part of the year.</p>
<p>Harker has previously been a reliable source, though even still, it's worth taking what is a small suggestion towards an event in September with a grain of salt. Right now, after Death Stranding 2, there's really nothing that we know about in the summer coming from PlayStation.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be that PlayStation doesn't have anything loaded for the summer and is holding out until it can have a big blowout presentation in September. But it's not out of the question that PlayStation will hold an event focused on its third-party partners, with currently unannounced games to show or games that don't yet have release dates getting a summer date set, to hold players off until we get some insight into what PlayStation first-party has been up to sometime in September.</p>
<p>The last State of Play event we had (that wasn't a game-specific event, like the Borderlands 4 one), was this past <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">February</a>. A third-party showcase for the summer, followed by a first-party State of Play or Showcase event in September, sounds about right as far as the kind of cadence these events usually happen with.</p>
<p>At the time of writing in the latter half of May, we're all looking towards Summer Game Fest for the next batch of big announcements. We could see PlayStation sneak in before SGF 2025 kicks off, as it has done before, or after, with some kind of smaller event ahead of their bigger showcase in September, if Harker is right about that.</p>

			<p>Build a Rocket Boy is launching its first game, MindsEye, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in around two and a half weeks</a>. The development studio founded by former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies has finally shared the PC system requirements that users must meet to play the game on the platform.</p>
<p>MindsEye is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, so its requirements are fairly in line with what we've seen in the genre.</p>
<div><p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em></p><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10/11 64 Bit with latest updates</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i5-12400F / AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB VRAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;70 GB available space</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em></p><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10/11 64 Bit with latest updates</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i7-13700K / AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT 8GB VRAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;70 GB available space</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On PC, the game will feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a>, guaranteeing accelerated frame rates for owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. GeForce RTX 40 users can still enable Frame Generation, while RTX 30 and 20 users can activate Super Resolution. The integration of AMD and/or Intel upscalers hasn't been confirmed yet, though it is likely.</p>
<p>Despite MindsEye Game Director Leslie Benzies's previous work on GTA, this game won't be an open-world extravaganza with tons of activities and content. Instead, it is a narrative-driven action/adventure thriller that aims to deliver thrilling cinematics, car chases, combat, and the like.</p>
<p>MindsEye also ties into <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, Build a Rocket Boy's user-generated content platform. In the future, players will be able to create UGC for this game in a way that Associate Game director Adam Whiting has compared to customer Minecraft servers. Users will also get to exploit MindsEye assets elsewhere in Everywhere's creations.</p>
<p>Everywhere doesn't have a release date yet.</p>
