			<p>We know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest</a> will have plenty of announcements, reveals, and special looks at upcoming games, and we can add another to the list as Kojima Productions has confirmed that Hideo Kojima will join Geoff Keighley on the Summger Game Fest mainstage to host a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach 'game premiere' presentation on Sunday, June 8.</p>
<p>It'll go live at 7pm PT / 10pm ET, and per the current Summer Game Fest <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/events">schedule</a>, it'll be the weekend's final event to close out this year's SGF. According to a press release, it'll be the start of a "<em>world tour</em>" for Death Stranding 2 that will lead up to the launch, and keep going all the way into November of this year.</p>
<p>As far as what the presentation will show, the press release adds that it will be an "<em>exclusive look</em>" at the game, and that there will be other special guests joining Kojima and Keighley on stage. It doesn't go into who these guests will be, but a good bet would be that the core cast of the game will join Kojima and Keighley on stage.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of where the Death Stranding 2 tour will go, and when the tour will be making its stop:</p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-US">8th June - Los Angeles&nbsp;</span></li>

			<p><span>FromSoftware has just&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its new game, Elden Ring Nightreign, has already registered over two million players on its launch day. On Steam, it has peaked at 313K concurrent players, and it could certainly get higher during the weekend.</span></p>
<p>On one hand, this is entirely unsurprising since it's the spin-off of a game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-units-after-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over 30 million copies to date (and is now getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie</a>, too). On the other hand, Nightreign is inevitably an experiment to some degree, and its formula wasn't exactly guaranteed to be equally attractive. Indeed, critic scores were a bit lower than usual for the Japanese studio. However, our Francesco De Meo still enjoyed his time with the game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his 9/10 review</a> published earlier this week:</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</em></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>
