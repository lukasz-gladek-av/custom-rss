<p>The Early Access version of Starsand Island introduces a <strong>dynamic seasonal system</strong>. Each season transforms the island's scenery, atmosphere, and available activities, creating a <strong>truly living world</strong>.​</p>



<p>Core professions have evolved significantly, expanding from beginner levels into comprehensive expert tiers. Farming supports <strong>nearly 100 crop varieties</strong>, complete with a hybridization system for breeding unique flowers and late-game greenhouses that enable year-round cultivation of rare plants regardless of season. Crafting benefits from new special machines and advanced tools, unlocking automated mining, logging, and farming to let players focus on exploration and creativity. Ranching expands with <strong>over 10 new species like cows and alpacas</strong>, more than 40 subspecies and color variants, and over 10 professional tools and facilities for realistic livestock management. Fishing introduces a Fish Trap system alongside <strong>100+ aquatic creatures</strong>, including rare "King Fish" such as Arapaima, Long-barbeled Dragonfish, and King Glowfish. Exploration and combat gain depth through newly added bows and various arrow types with elemental effects.</p>



<p>T<strong>he roster of interactable NPCs has grown to 15 characters</strong>, including four new companions for deep relationship-building. Each NPC boasts a unique personality tied to their profession. They are also voice-acted, and maxing out affection with the NPCs unlocks fully voiced exclusive storylines.</p>



<p>Housing features <strong>nine homestead subplot</strong>s across<strong> three environments</strong>: Blue Beach, Cloudrest Lake (a serene bamboo forest), and Windflute Island (a private paradise). The Early Access version already includes <strong>more than 300 furniture pieces</strong> and hundreds of decorative items, allowing for highly personalized island getaways. Traveling will be versatile thanks to <strong>more than 40 rideable mounts and vehicles</strong>, including more than 10 craftable options for land, water, and air.</p>



<p>Seed Sparkle Lab promises great freedom when it comes to character customization, thanks to<strong> fully modular outfits</strong>. Players can mix and match hats, hairstyles, and accessories, and there's an infinite color wheel for personalizing hair, eyes, and skin tones. Cooking rounds out the lifestyle features with over 50 recipes, many of which provide practical gameplay buffs. Lastly, the game world itself has been expanded with the <strong>Moonlit Forest expansion</strong>, featuring <strong>12 new camps and 3 epic bosses</strong>, each with distinctive challenges.</p>



<p>Starsand Island is expected to launch version <strong>1.0</strong> in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>, when the game will also debut on <strong>macOS</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>. The full version should introduce more content, multiplayer, and dating.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of the first video</a> in a series dedicated to the game's mechanics, <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> <span>also conducted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hPXEVG-X5g" target="_blank">an interview with Destin Legarie</a>, in which PR Director&nbsp;<strong>Will Powers</strong>&nbsp;discussed</span> the game's length.</p>



<p>Powers refused to provide a specific number, claiming that it only fostered negative discussion from both ends of the spectrum (those who don't have much time to play and those who have more free time). However, he did share some interesting tidbits: the <strong>main campaign is apparently just a very small percentage of the overall content available in Crimson Desert</strong>, and he said there's lots to do even after the main campaign is over. Furthermore, Powers added that <strong>he spent about 50 hours just on side activities</strong>, such as crafting. Overall, the game is "massive".</p>



<p><em>Respectfully, I dislike this question. I understand why it is asked, but players devour games in different ways. Some barrel through the main campaign immediately, but providing a specific number is difficult. If I give a large number, parents with limited time may feel discouraged or intimidated by the game. Conversely, students with more free time might find the same number too small. Regardless of the figure I provide, it feels like a losing proposition. I have been consistent in my refusal to provide a specific number, but <strong>I can say the game is massive</strong>. What I appreciate about it is the flexibility; you can choose what to do in each session based on your available time. There is a constant sense of progression and reward, even in the smallest activities.</em></p>



<p><em>Last week, I spent 50 hours playing the game. I sat down and played for 50 hours, focusing primarily on side content. I was not even fishing; I was mining, upgrading weapons, and testing mechanics. Since there is a set difficulty for all enemies, you can grind to overcome challenges through sheer willpower if you choose. This is an intended design choice. We never want a player to feel they must simply "get good" to proceed. If you invest time, you can beat everything. Alternatively, an incredibly skilled player could run right through it. The game should not prevent progression simply because a player does not understand a specific mechanic.</em></p>



<p><em>It is impossible to provide a definitive answer for open-world games because people rarely follow only the critical path. However, the main campaign represents only a small percentage of the overall content. For me, <strong>the game truly expanded after the credits. I realized I had barely scratched the surface of certain factions and their entire quest lines</strong>. Because I work on the game, I am aware of the available content, yet even after finishing the story, I realized I had missed entire areas because I was too focused on the main path. There is a vast amount of content to return to, including deep customization options and systems to invest time in. The developers' approach was to create an open world that encourages exploration. Their strength lies in creating emerging, immersive worlds where players can spend thousands of hours.</em></p>



<p>Crimson Desert is definitely one of the most anticipated games set to release in early 2026.

            <title><![CDATA[Beast of Reincarnation Is No Soulslike: “We’ve Made It so That It’s Enjoyable for Even Those Who Aren’t Good at Action Games”]]></title>

			<p>Japanese developer<strong> Game Freak</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-this-nier-beast-of-reincarnation-gameplay-and-soundtrack-immediately-bring-yoko-taros-series-to-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the first proper look at their new franchise</a>, <strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong>, during the recent <strong>Xbox Developer Direct Show 2026</strong>. Following that appearance, several gamers noted the <strong>apparent similarities with the Soulslike genre</strong>. However, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/63919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Famitsu</a>, Game Director <strong>Kota Furushima</strong> revealed <strong>several key differences</strong>, such as the design goal of making the game completable even for those who are not action game experts, and the ability for players to lower the difficulty. This is <strong>famously absent in most Soulslike games</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We're trying to make it so that even people who aren't good at action games can enjoy it. You can also choose the difficulty level, so if you're unsure, I think it's best to lower the difficulty level. Personally, I'd be happy if people could enjoy the game by taking an approach that actually lowers the difficulty level, by devising the skill tree system and Koo's support.</em></p>



<p>That's not to say there won't be times when you will be challenged in Beast of Reincarnation. Again, though, Furushima stressed that <strong>they're not trying to make a game where you're forced to fight a boss hundreds of times</strong>, which is practically a key component of a Soulslike game.</p>



<p><em>I think there will be times when you get defeated, and I want players to enjoy trial and error, trying different fighting styles next time, or changing Kuu's skills. However, I don't intend for players to never be able to clear the game on their first try, or to have to retry dozens or hundreds of times, so I hope that players will pick it up without being too scared.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Game Director confirmed that the protagonists, <strong>Emma the Sealer and Koo, each have three skill trees</strong>, enabling a variety of playstyles. For example, as well as close-range combat, you can attack with long-range weapons and perform stealth actions. There are also other ways to change your fighting style; while you can learn action-oriented skills, you can also acquire passive skills that simply boost Emma and Koo's stats or recovery rate.</p>



<p>Beast of Reincarnation is currently slated for a <strong>Summer 2026</strong> launch window on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>. Stay tuned for more details as the release date approaches.</p>
