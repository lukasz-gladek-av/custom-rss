			<p>Amidst all the craze of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, PlayStation has slipped in the news that the PS5 and PS5 Pro are going up in price in the US starting tomorrow, August 21, 2025, following price increases in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">Canada</a> three years ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">in Europe and the UK and other regions in the world this past April</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the price of the consoles is going up $50 across the board.</p>



<ul>
<li>PS5 (with disc drive) - was $499.99, will be <strong>$549.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 (without disc drive) - was $449.99, will be <strong>$499.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 Pro - was $699.99, will be <strong>$749.99</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, confirmed this past May that the company was looking at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">price increase in the US as part of Sony and PlayStation's response to US tariffs</a>, and today that increase was revealed, though Sony doesn't come out and directly blame the increase on tariffs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the vice president of global marketing at Sony, Isabelle Tomatis, writes that the increase is happening as a result of Sony's journey to "<em>continue to navigate a challenging economic environment.</em>"</p>



<p>Pricing around official PlayStation accessories "<em>remain unchanged</em>" for now, and it seems like, at least for the near future, PlayStation fans around the globe don't have to worry about price increases in their regions, as Tomatis writes, "<em>we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em>"</p>

			<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia, developed by Evil Empire and published by Ubisoft, has surprise-launched on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles today during Gamescom 2025, with a Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 launch to come sometime later this year.</p>



<p>It's also dropped on Xbox Game Pass, so players who have a Game Pass subscription and have yet to check out the game since its Early Access launch last year can jump into the action without making an extra purchase.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The news was unveiled during Xbox's Gamescom 2025 live stream, and though it is still technically a shadow-drop, it's not that much of a surprise since Ubisoft previously revealed an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">"<em>August 2025</em>" launch window for the game's 1.0 version this past June</a>.</p>



<p>The game has come a long way since its early access launch in May 2024, but even at that launch, it already looked like an impressive 2D action game that fans of the roguelite genre wouldn't want to miss. This, again, isn't all that surprising considering it was developed by the same team that worked on Dead Cells.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed the early access version</a> of The Rogue Prince of Persia last May, he wrote "<em>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite."</em></p>
