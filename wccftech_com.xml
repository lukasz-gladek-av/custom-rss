			<p>The creator of the amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project</a>, which was so good even in its first few versions that it was officially implemented in the next-gen version, released some stunning texture packs for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p>The first of these packs created by Halk Hogan PL is the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1614?tab=images" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ultra Quality 8K Body Textures - Imperials</a> pack, which comes in different resolution options, including 8K diffuse with the best quality, improves body details and quality, makes skin color more natural, and is more suitable for all Imperial characters. The results are excellent, as highlighted in the comparison screenshots on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1614?tab=images">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the description of the texture pack above found on Nexus Mods, the Ultra Quality 8K Body Textures pack is best used with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1284">Realistic High Quality Skin pack</a>, which improves human skin and makes it more realistic for all the races found in Oblivion Remastered, except for Argonians and Khajiits. This texture pack also slightly improves face details.</p>
<p>The third Oblivion Remastered texture pack shared by Halk Hogan PL is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2522?tab=description">Smooth Beautiful Faces pack</a>, which introduces impressive face textures that are a significant improvement over the vanilla textures. Among the improvements the new textures bring are more detailed lips, high-quality eyebrows, and more. Despite the new textures working best for female characters with the youngest possible age of the character creator, they still improve the faces of characters of all ages.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be a much larger game than the original. The news came <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Eurogamer</a>, which recently had the chance to play around 30 hours of the game at Kojima Productions headquarters and relayed the info that this constitutes roughly 40% of the story. This means the game could last as much as 75 hours, nearly double the average playtime of the previous installment (40 hours).</p>
<p>It's not too surprising when you consider that the first game was the debut project of a brand new studio. While it had Sony's support, it was still a new IP from a new team, albeit led by a world-famous game designer. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first game's successful release</a> (Kojima Productions revealed last month that the game had reached 20 million players to date, although that counts players who checked out the game via their subscription services), Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is going the classic way of bigger and better, albeit still with Kojima's unique twist.</p>
<p>One of the changes from the original will be the increased combat options. Kojima said that this was partly because of people asking him to make another Metal Gear title:</p>
<p><em>There are so many people all over the world asking me to make another Metal Gear, so I added more options for combat. When I was working out those mechanics, I was a little worried because many of the staff that worked with me on Metal Gear still work here, and we kept saying to each other, 'Does this feel too much like Metal Gear?' It wasn't on purpose.</em></p>
<p>As a side note, the sequel will include some unreleased songs by the late Ryan Karazija, founder and lead vocalist of Low Roar. Kojima said he was contacted by Karazija's family, who told him that the singer wished for these songs to be included in the new game (his work was heavily featured in the previous Death Stranding).</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be released <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on June 26</a>, along with a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-provides-players-with-more-choices-and-freedom-says-kojima-limited-edition-dualsense-controller-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited-edition DualSense controller</a>. The game will initially be available for Sony's PlayStation 5; however, given that Kojima Productions has purchased back the publishing rights from Sony, it's fair to expect the game to launch on PC and Xbox (like the original) in the not-too-distant future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Vienna-based Ori developer Moon Studios is not actually in trouble, <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1921646282726138116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to its own founder and CEO, Thomas Mahler</a>.</p>
<p>On the developer's Discord, Mahler had told fans in no uncertain terms that they need their help to survive and complete No Rest for the Wicked. The studio's latest game, a top-down action RPG, debuted around a year ago on Steam Early Access and just <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-breach-update-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-lots-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a large update. However, the player numbers aren't that great, and neither are the user reviews (72% for the recent ones, 74% overall), with the latter leading to the former. Mahler claimed (as first <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/ori-studio-in-crisis-no-rest-for-the-wicked-could-be-their-final-game-1541163/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by Gamereactor) that Moon Studios is the victim of 'review bombing' and asked true fans to help counterbalance the phenomenon with their own reviews of No Rest for the Wicked.</p>
<p><em>I think people think I'm joking when I'm asking for positive reviews cause in people's mind there's always some big publisher in the background who'll cover costs...</em></p>
<p><em>Folks, if you're writing here and are enjoying Wicked and are excited for future updates, but haven't left a positive review, it's entirely possible that we won't be around in a couple of months to do anything anymore simply because we got review bombed which leads to people not buying the game. Which means we're not making any money and will have to shut down.</em></p>
<p><em>I wouldn't ask if our business wouldn't be dependent on it. I also never write reviews on anything, but if you want to see us actually finish Wicked, it's detrimental that we get that review score back up.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Mahler is absolutely correct that they do not have a publisher's backing anymore. While Private Division originally published No Rest for the Wicked, Moon Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repurchased the rights a couple of months ago</a>. As you might recall, Take-Two <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-annapurna-staff-form-new-company-to-inherit-private-division-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold Private Division</a> to a new company managed by former Annapurna Interactive staff members.</p>
<p>However, a few hours ago, Mahler suggested that the press had misinterpreted his original statement. Here's what he wrote on X:</p>
<p><em>Overall, pretty much everyone who’s tried Wicked after the last few hotfixes is extremely positive. The reason I left the post on Discord up was simply to push back against some of the bullshit reviews. I have no issue telling active players who love Wicked that they should go ahead and leave a positive review on Steam. After all, it’s allowed on Steam to buy a game, leave a negative review that doesn’t even talk about the game at all (there are negative Wicked reviews that literally just say '.'), and then instantly refund it… and the negative review still counts.</em></p>
<p><em>If that’s allowed, then it should also be allowed for a developer to encourage their players to share their real experiences. And no, we’re not in immediate financial danger—but from time to time, I think I’m allowed to speak up about issues within our industry I personally find unbecoming.</em></p>
<p><em>We are continuing as always—our goal is for every game Moon Studios creates to be an absolute masterpiece, and with Wicked we’re already on the way.</em></p>
<p>It would be a shame to see Moon Studios close down, that's for sure. The Ori games were stellar, and No Rest for the Wicked also has 'extreme' potential, as noted by Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our early access preview</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. is coming to all the main consoles (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2) following <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-available-on-steam-new-launch-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut on PC on January 28</a>.</p>
<p>The news was shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivwjAPp-w6Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during Virtua Fighter Direct 2025 Spring</a> by legacy Virtua Fighter project producer Seiji Aoki, who stated:</p>
<p><em>I know we’ve kept you waiting, but our Steam release Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. is finally coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. Since Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.'s launch, we’ve heard your requests for multiplatform support via the official Virtua Fighter Discord and other channels. We on the development team want to give users on all platforms the opportunity to enjoy Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., so we are happy to bring you this announcement.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Also, in bringing this title to multiple platforms, we’re planning to include cross-play support. And to make your cross-play experience even smoother, the rollback functionality used in the Steam version will be supported on all platforms. We’re going to include even more content to make this much more than a simple port, which we’ll tell you about in future updates.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. - Multiplatform Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4EEo8qyubs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During the dedicated live stream, the developers also provided an update on the New Virtua Fighter Project. Wolf Hawkfield, a returning character, will be featured in the upcoming new franchise installment. As part of the announcement, it was also explained that each character's motivations behind their decision to join the fighting tournament would be made much clearer to players this time around. Producer Riichiro Yamada said:</p>
<p><em>In previous Virtua Fighter games, the backstories and motivations of the characters weren't well known. This is one of the major differences between the previous games and our new game. Playing the new game will give you a much better sense of who the characters are, including their backstories and personalities.</em></p>
<p><em>This includes characters from the previous games, too. Legacy characters have been refined for the modern age but remain authentic at their core. </em><em>Wolf's motivation this time is his love for wrestling. What's happened to Wolf since the last game? Why does he fight?</em></p>
<p><iframe title="New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project - Wolf Hawkfield Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnyE4tsQ3w8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Project does not currently have a release window, but we'll keep you updated on any rumors and news about it.</p>
