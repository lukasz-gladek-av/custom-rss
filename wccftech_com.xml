			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is getting significantly upgraded on Nintendo Switch 2, with support for two different display modes supporting high resolution and framerates.</p>
<p>As confirmed during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, the fourth entry in the series launching later this year worldwide will also receive a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, which will take advantage of the system's power to offer two display modes. In Quality Mode, the game will run in docked mode at 4K resolution, 60 FPS with HDR support, and at 1080p, 60 FPS with HDR support in handheld mode. In Performance Mode, the game will run at 1080p resolution, 120 FPS with HDR support, and 720p resolution, 120 FPS and HDR in handheld mode. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Nintendo Switch 2 will also support the new Joy-Con 2 mouse functionality, which is sure to make the experience even better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a release date has yet to be officially confirmed for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, so we still don't know when we will be able to experience Samus Aran's new adventure and some of the game's mechanics, which include the Psychic Abilities shown in the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-new-gameplay-trailer-introduces-psychic-abilities-and-more/">latest trailer</a> last week. These abilities promise to spice up the experience considerably as they will allow Samus to operate mechanisms, open doors, control the trajectory of beams, and more.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">2025 release date</a> on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are two of the games getting upgraded versions for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2. </a></p>
<p>These new upgraded versions will be classified as the "Nintendo Switch 2 Editions" of each game, and if you already own either game, or any of the games that are getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you'll be able to get the new version by purchasing an upgrade pack.</p>
<p>Both games will enjoy improved visuals and framerates, with HDR compatibility added for both titles that are surely to make the painted art style for each game pop and look better than it has before.</p>
<p>Nintendo also revealed that the Nintendo Switch Online app would be renamed to the Nintendo Switch app and will include a "Zelda Notes" section that will provide helpful tips to players while they're exploring Hyrule, as well as allow Tears of the Kingdom users to easily share their creations.</p>

<p>We don't yet know how much the upgrades are going to cost, though if you've yet to buy either Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom, it would be a good bet that both games are going to be available at the regular full price for brand-new Nintendo games.</p>
