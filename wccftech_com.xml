			<p>IO Interactive's take on James Bond will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 27, 2026, the studio announced at the tail end of the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/03/watch-over-30-minutes-of-007-first-light-gameplay-launching-march-27-2026/">PlayStation State of Play</a> presentation today that delved into its gameplay.</p>



<p>Beyond the fact that we would be getting a big showcase of the game today, we got a major hint that a release date was going to be announced when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-price-leak/">price for the base game and its much more expensive collector's edition leaked hours before</a> the showcase kicked off.</p>



<p>The presentation delivered on its promise of showcasing the gameplay, first with a playthrough of an early level with no commentary shown, followed by a later mission in the game shown with commentary from IO Interactive, detailing how different systems in the game work, and how players can figure out their own path forward through multiple options for completing the same objective.</p>

<p>We also got a confirmation of the full cast, with Patrick Gibson, who you might recognize most recently from the Dexter: Original Sin series, starring as James Bond. We also got a better look at what the $300 collector's edition will include, which is a copy of the game along with its deluxe edition digital upgrades, a golden gun weapon skin, and a golden gun figurine complete with a stand, secret compartment, a magnetic steel case, and a certificate of authenticity so you can prove to the people who show off the figurine to that you really did spend $300 for it.</p>

<p>"<em>With&nbsp;</em><em>007 First Light</em>, we’re building a wholly original James Bond experience from the ground up, one that blends the sharp tension of espionage with the bold spectacle the franchise is known for," chief executive officer of IO Interactive, Hakan Abrak, said in a press release. "<em>The gameplay is rooted in our signature approach to immersive design, combining stealth, action, and creativity in a way that feels uniquely tailored to Bond.</em>"</p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2025, IO Interactive gave press and content creators a behind-closed-doors presentation of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly anticipated upcoming game, 007 First Light</a>. The booth was certainly a looker, especially with a shiny Aston Martin placed in front of it to remind everyone how big this brand really is.</p>



<p>Inside, we were shown footage from one of the game's early missions. After just a few minutes, it was clear that the Copenhagen-based studio was doing things quite differently from its HITMAN series. There's a decidedly more cinematic style to everything, which is far from surprising given that we are talking about James Bond, one of the most iconic movie characters (even though, of course, he originally appeared in Ian Fleming's novels and short stories) of all time. Every character has more flair, starting with Bond himself, who is immeasurably more charismatic than the glacial Agent 47. At this stage, he's also a lot more brash and cocky than we're used to in the movies; that is because IO Interactive and the licensing partners have decided to go with an origin story that's going to explore how Bond becomes a double 0 agent in the first place. In the mission, Bond is assigned to keep watch outside of an important event, but he cannot help himself and goes inside after noticing some odd behavior from certain guests.</p>



<p>The gameplay eventually shows some of the gadgets available to Bond at this point in the game, but what's quickly obvious is that this is not going to be anywhere near as open-ended a sandbox as HITMAN. In fact, it appears to draw a lot of similarities with Uncharted-style games, which is why I came up with the headline. There are even big setpieces akin to what we're used to from Naughty Dog's games.</p>



<p>There's nothing wrong with that - I loved the Uncharted games, and so did millions of people, if the sales are anything to go by - and this is going to be multiplatform, unlike those titles. It's just that HITMAN fans should be aware this will be quite a bit different from the usual fare they've come to expect from this studio. Visually, the game looks great in the latest version of the Glacier engine, although character models aren't quite as good as what we've seen recently from other engines. I noticed frame rate slowdowns at least a couple of times, but 007 First Light is still in Pre-Alpha, so that is to be expected.</p>



<p>After the presentation, I was able to chat for a bit with IO Interactive's Senior Licensing Producer Theuns Smit. As a reminder, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will launch the game on March 27, 2026</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p><strong>Can you explain what your role entails?</strong></p>



<p>As you would expect from a licensed IP like James Bond, we have a great collaboration between IO Interactive and our partners at Amazon and Metro Goldwyn Mayer. This means that everything that goes into the game, we collaborate with them on that, so there's submissions and reviews and approvals and all of that. It also means that, as we've been crafting this experience, we have been granted access to the consultants who have been working on this IP as well, collaborating together on all of that. I help keep track of things that are moving in, getting approved, and working with our brand partners. James Bond is synonymous with working with Omega, Aston Martin, Land Rover, these folks were all equally and extremely excited to partner on this, and I just help manage those interactions..</p>



<p><strong>007 First Light is an original story, though, correct?</strong></p>



<p>That's exactly right. Obviously, we have over 25 years of experience in the agent fantasy genre with HITMAN, but for 007 First Light, a big focus for us is that from the get-go, we wanted to tell an original, standalone, reimagined origin story. This means that we get to go back to before James Bond is at MI6, before he earns his double 0 status, fresh out of the Royal Navy. We are given the opportunity to explore that space.</p>



<p><strong>In the presentation, Bond seemingly kills some people. Does that mean that by that point in the game, he has already earned the famous License to Kill?</strong></p>



<p>I almost feel like I don't want to completely spoil a few things, because there's a deep narrative connection to it. As you know from 007 lore, it takes two kills to earn double 0 status, and that is something that we lean into, of course, and that is part of the journey you're taking on. But that license to kill doesn't just mean you go into any situation with guns blazing. When met with deadly force, you reciprocate, and in certain moments, like the one you saw in the presentation, it is very much all action all throughout, but in other areas, where perhaps there's a more open approach to a specific area. You try to get back to situation contact. So, License to Kill, do what you need to immobilize the enemies around you, and then go back to situation contained.</p>



<p><strong>Of course, you previously mentioned IO Interactive's track record with agent fantasy games. Even in the presentation, it was revealed that 007 First Light would have a mix of linear and more open missions. Can you share whether it will be an even balance between the two, or should players expect to see more of one type?</strong></p>



<p>For us, it's about the full experience you get in our game. There's the underlying story, the narrative that drives things forward, but that is in combination with the wealth of gameplay we provide. So, various missions will take you to various locations. Some of them are a little bit bigger. Some of them are a little bit smaller. It is what the story calls for, what we need to drive forward in this moment that we will either, you know, enlarge that space, an environment at that location, or put it a bit more on guardrails to tell what we need to tell. So, it's a third-person story-driven action adventure, and that is what determines kind of where we want to make things go more open up and where we want to be more linear.</p>



<p><strong>During the presentation, at some point, I noticed a lure ability greyed out, and the game told the player that they required more 'agency'. Can you explain what agency is?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Same as what you saw on your watch, for example, there's a bit of resource management to the different gadgets that you need to use. Here, it's about relying on James Bond's instincts, basically, so your instincts also have a bit of a gamified gameplay element to them. I'm not going to go into too much detail right now, but to keep things fun and balanced and not completely overpowered, there are moments where you need to or you get to rely on your intrinsic 'Bondiness', so to speak—Bond's charm and wit. Perhaps luring people over or bluffing your way through a situation. You saw a glimpse of that in the infiltration, where some folks are startled by this man jumping from the window and Bond goes like, penetration test, all good. That was an automatic reaction, but later in the game, there's this fun gameplay that comes into it where certain actions allow you to hold that metre up a little bit, and then using that to bluff your way out of a situation, something like that.</p>



<p><strong>Obviously, in HITMAN, disguises were a core component of the gameplay. Are they going to be a lot less prominent in 007 First Light?</strong></p>



<p>That's a good question. We definitely wanted to focus on the fact that these two different games and with James Bond, there are certain things that we get to lean in on more. It goes back to that trademark Bond charm, a little bit of social manipulation, espionage, and leaning into Bond's double 0 training. You can manipulate those around you to get into certain areas where you need to be, and so there are contextual outfits for the stories that you go on, but it is not the same of like, just grab an outfit and go as you're used to in the HITMAN games. We lean into the strength of Bond being Bond and his charm and his wit and his guile to get through situations.</p>



<p><strong>Is there some form of character progression system in the game? Can you unlock some new abilities for him through a dedicated system, or is it just narrative-driven?</strong></p>



<p>For us, it's a bit more narrative driven instead of what maybe it's picked from a role playing game kind of thing. We have definitely found some really fun and interesting ways of taking you through character and player progression. Some of it is tied to the gadgets that to unlock through the story, but also, as you're going for training, as we said, you start off as a young Bond, you can maybe throw fists a little bit, but yeah, you you haven't been the Mature and well rounded agent that he becomes. As you work through that to earn your number, there are key moments where we can expand on the things that you, as the player, get to do. So, it's about taking you and Bond on that same progression journey together from a narrative point view and I feel it works very well.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share an estimate for the game length of 007 First Light?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. I suppose it depends on what kind of player you are. It comes back to our variety of locations. There's a big story to tell. Some of the locations are going to be bigger. Some of them are going to be a bit smaller. But we'll also focus a lot on the immersion; this is not just an action/adventure game, this is a James Bond action/adventure game. That means there's a certain level of immersion that you would expect of the locations you find yourself in. As you saw in the previous trailer, even going to the MI6, what does that mean as a player? Explore around, feel, get immersed. All of that has an impact on the full flow and works out for you to play for yourself.</p>



<p><strong>I know that you'll be giving players the ability to replay the story missions with modifiers, correct?</strong></p>



<p>It's more coming down to the creative approach. This new chapter for Bond in gaming means that you go through certain areas, perhaps you're focusing more on being stealthy or more on using gadgets or something like that, and we wanted to make it so fun that you played again and perhaps tried something else. Take a different approach. That is where we focus when it comes to replayability.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to have some kind of online leaderboards like in HITMAN, where 007 First Light players compete for mission scores or something like that?</strong></p>



<p>Perhaps in the future, but for now, we're focusing on this standalone, action/adventure experience.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share the status of the game? Was the presentation grabbed from a Pre-Alpha or Alpha build? </strong></p>



<p>Yeah, it was a Pre-Alpha, very much work-in-progress build that you saw.</p>



<p><strong>Good to know. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/">Variety</a>.</p>



<p>This is the same series that was announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/">May 2024</a> with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe </a>that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,</em>" Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "<em>It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…</em>"</p>



<p>For Turner's part, she added that she is "<em>thrilled beyond measure</em>" to be stepping into the role. "<em>She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking.</em>"</p>



<p>It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected/">confirmed layoffs last week</a>, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "<em>unaffected</em>," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.</p>
