			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle developer MachineGames has shared new details about the game's story and world structure. In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-devs-interview-machine-games-lucasfilm-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>, Creative Director Jens Andersson said:</p>
<p><em>Well, in a way it's obviously a linear, very driven story that takes you around the world. We are doing this game a little bit differently than previous games that we worked on, where we're allowed to go back to previous locations and continue playing from there. It's almost like a time jump back. So you will be able to 100 percent the game on a single save lot. And the reason why we're doing it like that is that we have these really wide, big areas like Giza, and then we have stretches of more linear rollercoaster rides, and there's a lot of optional content in there... a lot of hidden mysteries and things like that. So we want players who focus on the story to be able to play through it, and if they really love an area, they can go back and just finish up everything without having to replay the more linear sections. It doesn't fit into the narrative story, but from a gameplay perspective, you can do it.</em></p>
<p><em>It's more of a linear story, to be honest. It's really well-told, well-acted by our amazing cast with a proper conclusion. And then you can keep going and discover everything that the world has to offer.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Andersson also talked about giving players the option to tweak combat and puzzle difficulty separately in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Understandably, there are more options for combat (Light, Moderate, Hard, and Very Hard), while there are only two versions of the puzzles.</p>
<p>By the way, we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> our own hands-on preview of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle based on a play session from a recent press event. Here's what Amy had to say:</p>
<p><em>Overall, I had a great experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and I can't wait to dive back into the world once more when the game officially releases. It was highly immersive, the characters were well-designed, the world design was stunning, and it was a really well-polished experience. It's perfect for those who are new and returning to the Indiana Jones franchise, or want a game that feels similar to what Tomb Raider and Uncharted offer</em></p>
<p>The game is out on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, and in Spring 2025 for PlayStation 5.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-qa-team-strike-over-activision-blizzards-return-to-office-mandate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6%E2%80%99s-qa-team-strike-over-activision-blizzard%E2%80%99s-return-to-office-mandate.1022457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-qa-team-strike-over-activision-blizzards-return-to-office-mandate/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The QA workers for Activision Blizzard have recently been on strike in protest of the company's return-to-office (RTO) mandate, as stated by the Communications Workers of America (CWA). On October 25, the QA team who worked on <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> rallied to make sure that there were work-from-home (WFH) accommodations for those who needed them. In this strike, they claimed that Activision and Microsoft had not granted any accommodations for employees with ADA-certified medical conditions. In addition to the QA team striking, over 300 Activision employees signed a petition earlier in the month to ask for the return of work-from-home options. This led to workers in Texas and California joining the Eden Prairie team in striking.</p>
<p>In a statement from the CWA, they wrote: "Despite multiple requests from the Union representing the video-game workers, Activision and Microsoft have been unable to articulate why specifically they are insisting workers must work in the office, even those with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home."</p>
<p>In addition to the CWA writing a statement, the pro-worker group A Better ABK also published their <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own statement</a> on October 25 on X, which stated that RTO was decided on the staff's behalf without their input or needs being considered. "We've also learned that the company is unwilling to provide people with remote work accommodations, even when it's the only option that meets an employee's needs, due to this alienating policy," says A Better ABK. It's not a surprise that those working for Activision Blizzard are consistently having to fight for better conditions, as A Better ABK has been working on improving the quality of life of ABK employees for a number of years.</p>
<p>Just shortly after they put out a statement, it was announced that the CEO of Microsoft got a pay raise of 63%, raising his salary to $73 million, despite there being an excessive amount of layoffs at the company and Microsoft subsidiaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard made a statement to Eurogamer</a>, saying that it understood "returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum."</p>
<p>Whether this means that they will make the accommodations needed for their staff is uncertain as of right now, but they are also far from the only company that is trying to push for RTO. For example, other huge companies such as Ubisoft and Rockstar have also been trying to get their staff back into the office to work on big releases, which has also led to protests from Ubisoft staff.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been officially confirmed that Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios, the game developer behind Concord. It isn't too surprising that this has happened, especially as Concord didn't land in the market the way Sony wanted it to. From the start of Concord's official release, it seemed that this was the way that Firewalk Studios was going to go. It's really unfortunate, as this was their first game with a lot of talented people, but the game wasn't marketed well, and it was a premium hero shooter in a sea of free-to-play hero shooters. Additionally, as soon as Concord was closed down and those who purchased it were refunded,<a href="https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/"> the Director of Concord</a> stepped down. It was noted by many who worked at Firewalk Studios that the developers still left at the studio were in limbo, and many also expected Firewalk Studios to be shut down.</p>
<p>It has now been confirmed by Jason Schreier that Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios in a <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1851318988489248986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851318988489248986%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>. Additionally, a<a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full internal email</a> has been posted on the Sony Interactive Entertainment blog, where an internal email from Herman Hulst, the CEO of Sony has addressed the closure. However, in this email, not only did they announce that Firewalk Studios is being closed down, they also announced Neon Koi's closure, and the mobile action game they've been working on will no longer be going forward.</p>
<p>Regarding Concord and Firewalk Studios, Hulst's statement says: "Certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players... We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options." Hulst then goes on to explain that Concord is being permanently sunsetted, and Firewalk Studios is being closed. This means that Concord will not be going free-to-play after all, after it was noted that the files of the game were<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-rumored-to-still-be-updating-on-steam-potential-to-go-free-to-play/"> still being updated</a> on SteamDB.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is a lot of uncertainty about where the staff affected will end up. The statement by Hulst says, "Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible." The number of staff they are looking to relocate and hire internally isn't stated, but it's possible that the numbers will come out in future updates as Firewalk Studio staff and Neon Koi staff members respond to the tragic news of both studios being closed.</p>

			<p>Now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is about to launch, BioWare is expected to largely move on to the next Mass Effect game, the studio's next project. After all, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in March 2023, a sizable amount of the Mass Effect team temporarily helped with iteration and polish for the latest Dragon Age game; the favor is likely to be returned from now on.</p>
<p>Speaking of The Veilguard, some fans aren't too keen on the game's art style. Indeed, I had some criticism on that count myself in the otherwise highly positive review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> yesterday:</p>
<p><em>From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal.</em></p>
<p>Michael Gamble, who has been the Executive Producer of the Mass Effect series for a long time, has now <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850994136629068091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reassured</a> fans on Twitter that the art style will be photorealistic, as it's been the case with previous entries:</p>
<p><em>Lots of people asking me about Mass Effect now that Veilguard reviews are out, and Oct 31 is close. Both are from the studio, but Mass Effect is Mass Effect. How you bring a Sci Fi RPG to life is different than other genres or IPs...and has to have different kinds of love. Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it.</em></p>
<p>Gamble also added that the sci-fi franchise would keep the mature tone of the original trilogy, although, on that note, I would say neither Andromeda nor Dragon Age have been any different.</p>
<p>It may be a long time before we see anything concrete about the next Mass Effect. Preproduction has been going on for a while, and we even <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-teaser-trailer-direct-sequel-to-me-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> a very early teaser trailer showing off an aged Liara T'Soni back in December 2020. However, as insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-four-years-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> a while ago, it will take at least three years of production from now on.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned teaser trailer and subsequent rumors, it seems BioWare will follow up on the original trilogy rather than keep the action in the Andromeda galaxy, given that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 game</a> hasn't captivated the audience nearly as much as the previous games. However, we'll have to wait until we hear from the studio to know for sure.</p>
