			<p>Sony is taking a page out of Nintendo's book with its console variations. Just like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/">Nintendo released a Japanese-language-only variation of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, a version of the console that is only sold in Japan and only has Japanese as an available language on the device, Sony is doing the same with a new Japanese-language-only digital PS5 console. Also, just like the Japan-only variant of the Switch 2, it's slightly cheaper than getting the standard version.</p>



<p>You could argue that it was an odd choice by Sony to end its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">State of Play Japan event</a> with not a new game reveal or announcement, but the reveal of a Japan-only PS5 console, but you can't really act surprised since the whole event was meant for the Japanese consumer. From that angle, it makes perfect sense to try persuading anyone who hasn't bought in on the PS5 yet in Japan with a new, cheaper version they can run out and buy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Currently, a standard digital PS5 in Japan costs ¥72,980 ($475), though this new regional variant will drop the price to ¥55,000 ($355), which is more than a solid discount. But that's still more expensive than what the price of the console when it launched in 2020, which was ¥39,980 ($260). This new price is actually a bit of a middle ground compared to where the price of the console was at launch, and where it is now after two price increases.</p>



<p>Compared to the rest of the world, players in Japan who have not yet bought a PS5 are going to get the best deal currently available, since $355 USD is significantly cheaper than the price of the console elsewhere in the world.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if Sony brings this same tactic to the PS5 Pro, to extend the reach of its higher-end model. </p>
