			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched yesterday, at the time of this writing, and in what seems to be a required milestone in the launch of any major title, it has done so with a number of performance issues. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">a new statement</a> from developer Leenzee Games, the studio acknowledges the reports it has received from players regarding performance problems and a few other issues with "<em>abnormal pricing</em>" and pre-order errors.</p>



<p>After thanking players who have supported the game and were there to play it on launch, Leenzee Games wrote that it has "<em>received reports regarding issues such as the game’s optimization not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>These problems should never have occurred,</em>" it continued, "<em>and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games adds that it is "<em>confident in the game's performance</em>" so long as your PC is within the studio's recommended technical specifications, but it is working on optimizing the game for the variety of PC builds out there. It also confirms that a patch is being worked on, and that Leenzee will release it "<em>as soon as we can</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games also quickly touches on "<em>pricing anomalies</em>" in some regions where the game is being sold, and just says that it is trying to work with Steam to ensure that the correct price is listed in every region. </p>



<p>Lastly, Leenzee Games addresses reports of players not getting promised pre-order rewards, an issue it also says will be fixed in its next patch. And as a sign of appreciation for its players, everyone who purchased the game on Steam is getting a free copy of the game's soundtrack. If you bought the deluxe version of the game on Steam, then you'll also be getting a brand-new costume in a future update, as another token of the studio's appreciation for your support.</p>



<p>A free copy of the soundtrack and new in-game cosmetics is nice and all, but what players want is for the game they purchased to run smoothly. Of the 8,000+ player reviews for WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">only 21% of them are positive</a>, with pretty much every negative review citing major performance problems. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">Francesco De Meo looked at WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers for his review</a>, he also cited performance issues as a key drawback of the game, and while it has a strong art style and some engaging combat elements, the performance problems aren't the only things players have to worry about in Fallen Feathers. </p>



<p>"<em>Uninspired level design, mediocre PC performance and a formula that relies a little too much on the genre's conventions hold the experience back a bit, making it worthwhile only for fans of the genre who haven't had enough of it, and are willing to look past some shortcomings.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has been in third place behind PlayStation and Nintendo for years now, and the recent wave of Xbox releasing games that would have previously been platform exclusives on PS5 and Nintendo Switch/Nintendo Switch 2 has only further solidified that Xbox isn't trying to move up the ladder; it's just trying to hang on to some level of market share.</p>



<p>And you should expect more ports, according to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms">The Game Business</a> and Circana executive director and video game industry analyst, Mat Piscatella. Piscatella spoke to The Game Business founder and editor-in-chief Christopher Dring about video game and hardware sales for June 2025, which saw the Nintendo Switch 2 become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">fastest-selling video game hardware in US history</a>, and, importantly for Xbox, saw Forza Horizon 5 be one of the top-five selling games on PlayStation in the US. </p>



<p>In fact, according to data firm Alinea Analytics, Forza Horizon 5 has become the<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/"> best-selling game on PS5 for 2025 so far</a>, and that kind of sales success is exactly what Xbox needs right now, even if it has to come from other platforms. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>People who buy a hardware system these days, they’re doing it because of the ecosystem, because of their friends list. You’re not going to get people to transition consoles because of exclusives anymore. We’re way beyond that point</em>,<em>"</em> Piscatella told The Game Business. "<em>People are entrenched into their systems. And bringing the content to them is the only way to win. And that is what everyone is doing, except for Nintendo they tend to do their own thing. Even they could benefit from it, but of course they won’t, that’s not their MO."</em></p>



<p>Piscatella continues to say that because the biggest live service games are so dominant on the charts tracking player engagement, it's key for publishers and game makers to go where players are, and unfortunately for Xbox, the majority of them aren't playing on a Series X/S console. </p>



<p>"<em>In the US at least, the Top Ten live service games suck up half of all gaming time every month, and every other game has got to fight for the remainder. So, bringing that content to where people are is the only way you’re going to be able to win in an environment like we’re looking at right now</em>,<em>"</em> Piscatella adds. "<em>Forza being this strong… that’s great. That really bodes well for its next iteration, if they come out day one across systems. Every game finding its way to more stores and ecosystems… that is how you’re going to survive and win.</em>"</p>



<p>And it's not just in the US that live service games dominate player engagement. We see it every month in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Newzoo's reports</a>, how new releases have the potential to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">crack the top-10 list of best-selling games</a>, but the top-10 games for player engagement are pretty much always the same, only ever swapping places with each other from time to time.</p>



<p>The fact of the matter is that Xbox has not been able to get players to buy into its platform this console generation, so it's trying to go where players are, instead of trying to convince players to spend hundreds to buy a console to play a new exclusive blockbuster. Even PlayStation has had to lean into the idea of going to where players are, with its recent efforts to port its games to PC. Nintendo is the last platform standing that can still convince players to buy into its platform for exclusive games, and that's probably going to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Dring, for his part, adds that Xbox is "<em>expected</em>" to port more games to Nintendo Switch 2 and PS5 "<em>in the coming weeks</em>," which can be read as a tease for announcements he might have a heads-up on, but it's also just the common-sense expectation to have, as we head into the next wave of announcements with Gamescom 2025 around the corner. </p>



<p>Xbox porting more of its games to other platforms is practically one of the few surefire predictions you could make about the upcoming show and the future of Xbox in the video game industry.</p>
