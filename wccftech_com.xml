			<p>A new STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl mod now available for download enhances the game's visuals considerably by improving shadows, lighting, and more.</p>
<p>The True Epic Graphics settings mod,&nbsp;<span>a tweaked configuration file that can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/580?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, not only improves some of the game's visual elements such as shadows, lighting, vegetation draw distance, and reflections</span>&nbsp;but also enables GTAO for considerably better visuals, as showcased in the comparison screenshots below. With the enhancements it features, however, this mod should only be used when running the game on high-end hardware.</p>

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally launched last month, and the long wait was totally worth it, as the latest entry in the series by GSC Game World is as uncompromising and unique as ever. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl&nbsp;is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. The game is also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library on PC and consoles.</p>

			<p>A Final Fantasy XVI mod currently in development promises to bring its battle system to new heights, introducing features that are common in character action games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.</p>
<p>The Logos Unleashed mod, which is being developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mThund3R_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mThund3R</a>, the same developer behind the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/89?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eikonic Equipment</a> mod, which introduces deeper RPG elements in the game, will expand combat options by introducing new Eikonic Feats that can be activated with directional inputs. With the Phoenix Eikon, for example, it will be possible to unleash an air launcher attack, a Shift Wave projectile attack, and a quick lunging finisher by pressing corresponding buttons. With Odin, to give another example, it will be possible to use the useful Rift Slip ability with a direction input without having it equipped.</p>
<p>While the Final Fantasy XVI Logos Unleash mod only integrates parts of certain skills into an Eikon basic moveset, it will open up a lot of interesting gameplay possibilities to make the game's excellent combat system even more engaging. You can check out some of the new options the mod will offer when it launches on a yet to be confirmed date in the video below.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review of the PlayStation 5 version.</a></p>

			<p>The United States Federal Trade Commission started issuing refunds to consumers impacted by Epic Games' practices in Fortnite, which led to unwanted purchases of perks, emotes, and other in-game elements.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ftc-starts-issuing-refunds-to-epic-games-users-following-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a>, the FTC confirmed that it is sending its first batch of payments to impacted users, totaling 629,344, half of them in checks and the other in PayPal transfers. The remaining payments will be sent at a later date. The average payment is around $114.</p>
<p>This first batch of refunds for Epic Games users is being set as part of a settlement reached back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-to-pay-520m-to-the-ftc-as-settlement-over-fortnite-privacy-case/">December 2022</a>. The FTC charged the publisher with deploying shady tactics to drive unwanted purchases of virtual currency in Fortnite to purchase outfits, perks, and emotes. For this violation, Epic Games had to pay $245 million in fines, which the FTC is using to issue the refunds that started making their way to impacted users today.</p>
<p>This isn't the only violation Epic Games was fined for by the Federal Trade Commission. The Fortnite publisher was also charged with violating the COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), collecting information from children under 13 who played the popular battle royale game without verifiable consent from a parent and making parents jump through hoops to have their children's data deleted, an issue that has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-ftc-settlement-and-moving-beyond-long-standing-industry-practices?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been addressed</a>. This violation cost Epic Games $275 million, bringing the total fine to $520 million.</p>
