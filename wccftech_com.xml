			<p>Today, Funcom announced that a large scale beta weekend (with no NDA) for Dune: Awakening will take place between Friday, May 9 and Monday, May 12, allowing a significant number of players to try the game ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new launch date of June 10</a>. Fans can attempt to get in by requesting access via the game's Steam page. However, those who aren't lucky enough to be automatically invited may still obtain a code by watching the Global LAN Party Broadcast, which will be broadcast live from both London and PAX East. Funcom said tens of thousands of beta codes will be given away during the stream.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed by the article's headline, Funcom provided select press outlets, including ourselves, with advanced access to this beta build. Content-wise, this is the same thing you'll be playing in the upcoming public weekend: there are around twenty to twenty-five hours of gameplay, featuring the Hagga Basin South Region, the Eastern and Western Vermilius Gap Region, and parts of the story's first Act.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>These first few hours are, perhaps unsurprisingly, almost entirely devoted to the survival and building aspects of Dune: Awakening. After character creation, where the player is given the choice of their starting skill tree, home planet, and background (noble or working class, for example), the Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit tasks you with a not-so-simple objective: head to Arrakis and find the surviving Fremen, who have been reportedly slaughtered by the Sardaukar, the Emperor's elite military force. The journey immediately starts to get complicated when the airship is shot down by a rocket launcher, leaving your character stranded in the desert with practically nothing on them. Thankfully, a mysterious character provides help and guidance through the very first part of the journey.</p>
<p>At this stage, it's all about surviving. First and foremost, there's the need to keep hydrated. This is Arrakis, after all, and water is the second most precious commodity after spice. Initially, you must gather dew from the few plants you'll encounter, though that kind of hydration can only fill you up a little. You also have to collect other resources, such as copper and metal, to create a variety of tools that can help you craft new items for your character and your base. To establish your property, you must first place a subfief console, which in turn lets you start building the base's foundation, walls, doors, roof, etc. Of course, some areas are off limits, but even the initial map is quite large and offers many places where building is allowed.</p>
<p>Eventually, you'll build a weak version of the iconic stillsuit, which helps greatly with water management. You'll also get access to a blood extractor that can be used to exsanguinate defeated foes. Blood can be consumed as is if you're desperately out of liquids, but that can make you sick. The ideal process is to bring it back to base and process it through a water purifier first.</p>
<p>You'll also need to pay a lot of care to sunlight exposure. When the sun is up and you're out in the open, a meter will quickly fill to urge you to the shadows. If the meter is filled, water starts depleting even faster. The game has a dynamic day and night cycle, so you'll only have to worry about this factor during daytime; however, the desert is patrolled by Sardaukar drones at nighttime. You'll want to avoid them at all costs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The last big environmental challenge is, of course, the sandworm. This is arguably the biggest threat early on in Dune: Awakening; whenever you cross the open sands, and depending on your current speed, there's a risk of alerting the deadly creature. Whenever that happens, players must rush to the nearest rocky ground - being swallowed by the sandworm also means irrevocably losing whatever was in your inventory (on the other hand, in PvE maps, dying by other means lets you rush back to your corpse to retrieve the dropped items).</p>
<p>Admittedly, I died a couple of times because of the sandworm, but it eventually became less of a bother, especially after I built my first sandbike. This is a fairly involved process of assembling various components, but it is well worth it. It's a massive improvement in your ability to travel the hostile game world that also offers no fast travel options, at least at this stage. Exploration feels good, at any rate, also thanks to the free-climbing (you can attempt to climb any surface, provided you've got enough stamina to make it to the top) feature, the shigawire claw (essentially a grappling hook), and the suspensor belt that lets you glide down without taking any fall damage.</p>
<p>Of course, Dune: Awakening also features a lot of combat. Melee is a big part of fights in this game, and there's a full gamut of actions available here, from blocking to dodging, from regular attacks to charged attacks. You can also equip three active abilities and three passive techniques from your skill trees.</p>
<p>At least in this beta, though, enemy variety was practically nonexistent. They're all ruthless (and nameless) killers and scavengers, hiding in the nooks and crannies of the desert or inside proper bases. In my explorations of the Hagga Basin map (which, interestingly, also resets its points of interest every once in a while due to Coriolis sandstorms <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like the Deep Desert PvP map</a>), I also found the botanical testing stations that Funcom previously discussed. Based on their description, I thought they'd be group dungeons, but at least the first one was just a regular soloable base without any boss-like encounters. They do have great loot and a few audio recordings for lore aficionados.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dune-Awakening-Screenshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Eventually, you'll run into the first outposts with NPCs that can provide you with contracts or even ask you to join their faction (for now, just Atreides or Harkonnen). There are a few missions here and there, but Dune: Awakening is not a game you'll play for the story. At its core, it is instead a survival sandbox crafting game like many others, albeit well-tailored to the Dune setting. What could truly set it apart from the veritable sea of such games is the MMO-like endgame part, where players form clans and join either Atreides and Harkonnen in a cyclic war for control of Arrakis and its spice, with potentially hundreds of players participating in large scale battles featuring combined arms warfare with ornithopters, buggies, and the ever-present threat of the sandworm to all parties. However, this was not in the beta, so we'll have to wait until launch before properly assessing the game.</p>

<p>Lastly, a few words about performance. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and can look pretty at times, even though its Lumen global illumination is not accelerated with hardware ray tracing. The announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation</a> is not yet available in the game, but the really worrying aspect is that even on a high-end PC (RTX 5090, Ryzen 7 9800X3D), stuttering was a constant presence during my play sessions.</p>
<p>I didn't measure it with software because Funcom may still be in the middle of optimizing the game. In fact, it could be the major reason behind the small delay from May 20 to June 10. Having said that, you can clearly see all the stutters in the gameplay video embedded above. Let's hope they can significantly improve optimization in these last few weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

						
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sci-fi-co-op-shooter-la-quimera-arrives-on-pc-later-this-month/">La Quimera</a> is a new story-driven, linear FPS from Reburn, the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine. While 4A Games was initially founded and entirely located in Ukraine, as Reburn chief executive officer Dmytro Lymar explained to Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-developer-qa-powered-by-unreal-engine-4-main-story-to-last-5-hours/">previously</a>, when the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine in 2014, the studio split between a Ukraine-based team and another based in Malta.</p>
<p>But Reburn didn't start developing La Quimera over a decade ago. Development began in 2020, after work on Metro Exodus was complete, and the studio took a new name shortly after Embracer Group acquired 4A Games.</p>
<p>Suppose you're like me, and you like a good story-driven, linear game, particularly a good story-driven FPS game, which feels like a rarity in the modern video game landscape. In that case, as I was, you'd probably be very excited by the pitch of 'developers who worked on the Metro games making a new sci-fi story-driven FPS that can also be played entirely in co-op.'</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unfortunately, my excitement was quickly diminished when I sat down to play La Quimera. I'm sorry to say that my favorite thing about it is that it's a short game, and I was able to finish it in a little less than 5 hours.</p>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the fact that I absolutely cannot imagine what it was like for the Reburn team making this game over the last five years. I also appreciate that it's not asking for a full $70 with its much more budget-friendly $30 price tag. But a bad game is a rip-off at any price, and not only is La Quimera not worth your time, but in its current state, I wouldn't even say it is ready to be released.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I don't have the hardware to display La Quimera in its best graphical light. I grew up a console player and built my first PC, the same one I currently play games and what I used to play La Quimera five years ago, aiming for what I felt was mid-range and, more realistically, what I could afford at the time. It's got a Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB of RAM, and an RTX 2060 in it that have always been up to the task for whatever I've thrown at it, which has honestly mostly been indie games I got for cheap on Steam and whatever else I couldn't play on my PS5 or Xbox Series X.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I'm not trying to play at 4K/120fps with my 1440p monitor that caps out at 60fps. I built my PC the way I did because I needed a new computer at the time, so why not make it something that could decently play games as well? I'm giving all that context so that you understand when I say La Quimera is a bad game, I'm not talking about performance issues that a beefier PC would likely be able to push through.</p>
<p>I'm talking about bad audio that was either delayed or simply not there, and poor audio mixing that made loud crash scenes sound quiet. I'm talking about bugs like being unable to move my reticle up or down when aiming down sight on a controller, an issue that doesn't exist when I play with my keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Enemies that are not fun to fight, whether humans or robots, the latter being half the combat encounters you'll face, should you play this game. Weapons that don't sound or feel like they have any weight to them, or feel like they're making an impact despite their admittedly cool designs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Writing and voice acting that made me wonder whether the lines from the human characters were meant to sound as stilted as the lines from your AI companion or any other voice that came from a machine. A story that set up threads which go nowhere, as if to set up a sequel that I can tell you now I have no interest in playing.</p>
<p>Nothing about La Quimera feels finished. Every part feels like a disjointed piece of the project that the team at Reburn stitched together without actually creating a singular image. Even the gameplay sits at the top of the list of positive takeaways from La Quimera by virtue of not being entirely bad.</p>
<p>The futuristic setting and the exosuit you wear after the opening mission, which is one of three, provide you with more options to make each combat encounter a little more interesting to get through. The scanner you get paired with a weapon that can shoot through walls helps to give you time to breathe in La Quimera's more explosive firefights without actually taking yourself out of the fight.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Being able to call up your own defensive drones to even the odds against the ones thrown at you, or taking a few moments to catch an enemy by surprise by entering a cloaked mode, are features I appreciate in a futuristic shooter. Not that there's any real stealth gameplay to go along with that latter feature, mind you, since enemies are quickly aware of your position once you've taken one of them out with a sneaky attack.</p>
<p>Regarding its setting, once again, I was intrigued by the idea of a futuristic dystopia set in Latin America, but what La Quimera's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam page</a> describes as a "<em>lush jungle</em>" and&nbsp;"<em>breathtaking megalopolis</em>" boils down to uninspiring levels with more grey than green on display and a story that throws in the odd Spanish word or phrase while everything else is in English.</p>
<p>I will say that it's clear a lot of work went into trying to make La Quimera look very sleek. I'm sure it would look more than fine if I had top-of-the-line hardware, but that proves that La Quimera is all sizzle and no steak. And while I'm not complaining that I didn't have to spend too long with it before the game ended, the short runtime doesn't give La Quimera any room to go anywhere.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/La-Quimera-Review-6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I could replay the missions to earn more of the in-game currency and upgrade my exosuit, but I can't say what I would get out of it. Maybe a fun video game, after I've played it enough times to get the rest of the upgrades, but why would the 'real' fun arrive so late in the experience?</p>
<p>Also, I will note that playing this ahead of release, I didn't get the chance to play it in co-op, which is an aspect of La Quimera that is consistently highlighted in its marketing. I could see it being more fun with friends at my side, jokingly mimicking the flat dialogue and running through the whole game in the same time it would take us to play a few rounds of whatever multiplayer game we could have been playing instead.</p>
<p>But that's not a winning argument for why you and your friends should download La Quimera and spend time with it over other games. And, as someone who was playing solo, the fact that La Quimera requires you to always be online, whether you're playing with other people or not, is absolutely a point against it. If I'm not playing with anyone, and it's a single-player experience, an offline mode should be available that lets me pause the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/La-Quimera-screenshot-13-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I really wanted to like La Quimera. The idea of a quick, intense FPS that tells a good story that I could play through again with my friends is one I can get behind. Besides, it's not like there haven't been <a href="http://wccftech.com/titanfall-2-4-players-co-op-revealed-new-trailer-released/">excellent FPS games</a> with a short campaign that are incredibly fun to go back to again and again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, La Quimera isn't one of them. While that could be a result of not enough development time, it's difficult to see this game improving tenfold if only its bugs were fixed. A lot more needs to be changed and reworked to bring La Quimera up to par to compete in today's overcrowded FPS market, even if it is one of the few offering a single-player focus over a multiplayer one.</p>

						<section>
				<p>La Quimera is an incomplete game, a mixture of stitched together parts that don't come together to make a full image. The amount of bugs are clear indicators that this game needed more time in development, but so is the underwhelming story and gameplay that aren't given enough time to go anywhere. If La Quimera was communicated as an Early Access release, then I'd be more hopeful for what's to come, but if this is meant to be the full game, it's not one that's worth your time.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-incredible-results-540p-to-1080p/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-incredible-results-540p-to-1080p/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS support for the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to be a massive game-changer for the upcoming system, as the AI upscaler is already delivering impressive results upscaling low base resolutions to 1080p.</p>
<p>In a recent hands-on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> going over the system and both first and third-party games, the tech experts at Digital Foundry had the chance to try out the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Street Fighter 6, among other games. The game is the first taste of a game powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine on the system, and it seems like it delivers on all fronts, sporting stable 60 FPS gameplay in docked mode with some visual cutbacks in line with those featured in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox Series S versions over the others. More interesting, however, is that the game is not running at native 1080p resolution as early analysis of the available footage suggested, but at 1080p resolution upscaled from base 540p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS. Given how clean the image looks, this is extremely impressive.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter 6 Nintendo Switch 2 port is not the only impressive third-party port that will launch with the system in a little over two months. Much like the CAPCOM game, Cyberpunk 2077 has also been<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> confirmed</a> to use a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. The upscaler is reportedly used for all the game's display modes in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">exceptions</a>. You can learn more about the new system by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">report.</a></p>
