			<p>Among the best and most unexpected modding projects to launch this year was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-new-version/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, which brings some stunning visual improvements to one of the most popular role-playing games released this year, as highlighted by a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The end of 2024 montage shared by the project's developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a> does an excellent job highlighting the improvements the mod currently brings to the game in pretty much every location in the game. From higher texture quality to improved lighting and much more, the fan-made project looks every bit as good as any proper remaster should.</p>

<p>The development of the Bloodborne Remaster Project was made possible by the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator, which allows users to play the game developed by FromSoftware on PC even without an official port. A new version of the emulator bringing a variety of improvements was released <a href="https://shadps4.net/index.php/2024/12/25/shadps4-v0-5-0-christmas-2024-release/">last week</a>, and made two more PlayStation 4 exclusives playable on PC - Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise and The Witch &amp; The Hundred Knight 2. You can check out how the emulator runs both games in the videos below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM">BrutalSam.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first and only Grand Theft Auto 6 currently available has been found online in better quality, allowing fans to better appreciate its stunning visuals while they wait for Rockstar Games to finally show more of their highly anticipated open-world game.</p>
<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/GTASixInfo/status/1873532834838900846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873532834838900846%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GTASixInfo</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@GameRollGTA</a> discovered a higher-quality version of the new trailer<span>&nbsp;compared to the one available on YouTube. This new version of the trailer, which was originally streamed on Chinese video streaming service BiliBili and can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YLzVdNhcdtwUvWkDA-9_ZrBpzAcc0bDl/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, has a higher bitrate than the YouTube version, which</span>&nbsp;makes it easier to appreciate some of the visual's finer details.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the release of the first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, but the anticipation for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games continues to become bigger by the day. Its release is expected by analysts to be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch to date</a>, and its<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/"> release window will have an impact on the entire video game industry</a>, as other publishers are aiming to launch their games as far away from it as possible and are holding back setting release dates for them until Rockstar Games finally confirms if the game is indeed launching in late 2025, or if it will be delayed to 2026, which is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">definite possibility</a>, considering the game's scope.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is currently in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-cease-exclusive-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-remake-series-could-cease-to-be-a-playstation-console-exclusive-in-2025.1071192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-cease-exclusive-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Remake series could cease to be a PlayStation console exclusive in 2025, judging from some recent statements.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://br.ign.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/134307/news/nao-podemos-ser-exclusivos-de-um-unico-console-diretor-de-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-diz-que-numeros-de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN Brazil</a> during The Game Awards 2024, Remake series producer Yoshinori Kitase commented on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sales and console exclusivity. While sales of the second entry in the series are deemed satisfactory despite the game not meeting profit expectations following launch, Kitase-san commented that it has become clear that modern games can no longer be exclusive to a single platform and that they need to be offered to as many players as possible.</p>
<p>Yoshinori Kitase isn't the only member of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series development team whose comments suggest the series could be coming to other platforms in the future. Speaking with Japanese publication <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241216014/index_5.html#sqe_ham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4Gamer</a> as part of their end-of-the-year developer roundup, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi stated that the team will continue to take on the challenge of bringing the series to as many fans as possible in 2025. As the second entry in the series is coming to PC in less than a month, it's evident how Hamaguchi-san is likely talking about other platforms as well, such as the Xbox Series X and S and the Nintendo Switch 2, which should be able to handle both games with some compromises in terms of visuals and performance if the leaked specs are real.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it won't take too long for the Final Fantasy VII Remake series to be released on other platforms, as the first two entries in the series are excellent games that deserve to be experienced by any JRPG fan. You can learn more about the first entry by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">my review</a> and about Rebirth by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/complete-rt-shader-1-6-promises-3x-faster-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Graphics modder NiceGuy has just updated his<a href="https://wccftech.com/rtgi-and-complete-rt-shaders-get-major-updates-with-sky-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Complete RT</a> ReShade shader to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/complete-rt-1-6-118832379" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 1.6</a>, claiming many improvements, such as up to three times faster performance.&nbsp;As shown in the video, running the Global Illumination mode at native resolution (100% on the slider) takes just 4ms versus the 13.5 ms of the previous Complete RT 1.5. This translates into much higher frame rates (71 FPS versus 49 FPS). Of course, this may vary depending on the game and the scene.</p>
<p>There's more, as the internal upscaler has received several updates. CompleteRT is now capable of dynamically adjusting the Global Illumination resolution with floating-point scales from 33% to 100%, and it can even automatically match the rendering resolution when using all the industry-standard upscalers from NVIDIA (DLSS), AMD (FSR), Intel XeSS, and even Epic's own Unreal Engine TSR. Additionally, this reportedly helps with performance, reduces flickering, and improves overall quality.</p>
<p>Complete RT's implementation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nvrtx-branch-has-been-updated-with-experimental-restir-gi-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR GI</a> was also enhanced. NiceGuy says both performance and quality have received an upgrade, and the accuracy is now close to the ground truth image. Lastly, the new shader has better specular reflections, too, thanks to a fix for the flickering that used to appear when using low roughness values. The precision of the reflections and their performance was also improved.</p>
<p><iframe title="Complete RT 1.6 | Teaser Update: 3x faster RAY TRACING! better Upscaling &amp; ReSTIR GI, new NiceHancer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9gEk1j_j6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NiceGuy also announced a brand new shader called eLITE RT. This is meant to be a much lighter screen space ray traced GI shader that could potentially run even on low-end or handheld hardware. The modder says he spent months of research and development on this project, essentially swapping priorities compared to Complete RT. While the latter focuses on quality while still targeting solid performance, eLITE RT focuses on performance while trying to achieve good quality.</p>
<p>Both shaders are only available to his Patreon subscribers. While Complete RT is unlocked on the second tier, which costs $6 monthly, the new eLITE RT is currently only available for subscribers of the third tier, priced at $11.50 monthly. That's because it is still in beta and requires more testing and feedback; it will eventually be moved to the same tier of Complete RT once it's ready.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/disney-wants-more-indiana-jones-titles-after-the-massive-hype-brought-in-by-great-circle/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Disney apparently wants more adaptations of the highly popular Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, as revealed by the Windows Central's Jez Corden in the newest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD58iKzc55c">Xbox Two podcast</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have done enough to impress Disney, so the studio now wants to develop more titles based on the IP. MachineGames, the developer behind the adaption, has done a great job mimicking the original Indiana Jones movies with Great Circle, which has been reflected in the title's popularity over the internet as well. Jez Corden says, "Disney picked up the phone and wants more Indiana Jones," implying that there are more adventures for the gaming incarnation of Indiana on the way.</p>
<p>The main reason Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have seen such a massive success, at least in terms of how the title turned out, is that MachineGames has a lot of experience with first-person view titles, notably the Wolfenstein series. This is why they have nailed the game in transitioning into various scenarios. And with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-bundles-indiana-jones-the-great-circle-with-geforce-rtx-40-gpus-full-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-support/">support for DLSS 3.5 and full path tracing</a>, the visuals are absolutely exceptional with this title.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not only this, but the title has excelled at replicating the lore of the original movie character, which has resulted in nothing but positive feedback for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">extensive review</a> of the title categorized it as "the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton," which seems to be the consensus among critics and fans alike.</p>
<p>While information around the future of the Indiana Jones series is uncertain, we can be optimistic about the franchise's development now that Disney is interested in getting a proper gaming franchise going. For now, the developers' main focus will be on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 port</a>, which is scheduled to launch next Spring, and the announced story DLC, The Order of Giants.</p>
<p>By the way, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has just been named the "Game of the Year" at the Gamescom tournament. It received 55% of the votes and dominated other big titles released in 2024, like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
