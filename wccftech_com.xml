			<p>Earlier this week, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Ghost of Yotei would last roughly as long as Ghost of Tsushima. Now, in another pre-release interview, the Seattle-based development studio has discussed the map size.</p>



<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ghost-of-yoteis-map-is-about-the-same-size-as-ghost-of-tsushimas-the-devs-didnt-want-to-compromise-on-density-for-a-larger-map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Automaton Media</a>, Sucker Punch revealed to have adopted the same vision. They didn't want to have to produce filler content for a much larger map. However, they did make sure to make the map feel grander, which is appropriate since this setting is much larger in real life than that of the previous game. </p>



<p>Jason Connell, Co-Director of Ghost of Yotei, explained:</p>



<p><em>Even though the map is roughly the same size, Hokkaido is obviously much larger than Tsushima in real life, so we concentrated our efforts on making the world appear larger than it actually is. You’ll see vast plains and massive mountain ranges towering in the background. This is all scenery that wasn’t as present in Tsushima, and it’s designed to help players feel the scale of things.</em></p>



<p><em>If we did that [doubled the size of the map], we’d have to fill the map with twice the content, and that content would need to be meaningful so as to not tire the player. Ghost of Tsushima was already a big enough game, so rather than upscaling just for the sake of it, we chose to focus on delivering more variety and higher quality while maintaining a similar scale.</em></p>



<p>The development team also improved exploration gameplay in various ways:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yotei includes various systems and details aimed at making exploration feel free and rewarding. For example, running through flowers increases your movement speed, and if you follow these flower trails, you might discover hidden secrets. We’ve also added new items like telescopes and binoculars to allow players to enjoy the scenery. All these details work together to ensure that players won’t get bored even on a large map</em>.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2 for Sony's PlayStation 5 console.</p>

			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-hands-on/">Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades</a> bring a slew of improvements that vastly enhance the experience, but the latter's upgrade also misses an important opportunity.</p>



<p>In a new in-depth analysis by Digital Foundry of the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for the two open-world entries in the series, it's confirmed that Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still uses AMD FSR 1 in the upgraded version. AMD's upscaler is mentioned in the game's Intellectual Properties page, and a deep look at the game's image quality confirms that it is still being used, leaving a lot of distracting flicker in view during gameplay. This is most definitely a missed opportunity, considering the Nintendo Switch 2 supports the superior NVIDIA DLSS upscaling solution that has already delivered impressive results in several launch titles.</p>



<p>Despite the above and a few other issues, such as issues with shadows not being completely fixed on Nintendo Switch 2, and a draw distance that's mostly identical to that of the original system, both Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are very solid upgrades. The higher dynamic resolution range in both docked and handheld mode returns a sharper image, which improves gameplay by making it easier to spot items on the ground from a distance, for example, and the new higher-quality environmental textures make both games more pleasing as a whole. The rock solid 60 FPS in both games, the faster load times and the implementation of the Zelda Notes round up two upgrades that are among the best we have seen to date.</p>

<p>Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are hardly the only games to have received significant improvements on Nintendo Switch 2. Splatoon 3, for example, sees an <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-increases-resolution-six-times-splatoon-3/">enormous resolution boost</a> on the system, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/">unpatched games</a> running at unlocked framerates often hit 60 FPS with no trouble.</p>

			<p>The original Silent Hill remake announced last month may release sooner than most anticipated, as it reportedly has been in the works for a few years already.</p>



<p>Speaking on X, known leaker Dusk Golem revealed that the remake of the classic survival horror game in development by Bloober Team has been in the works for three years already, before the remake of the second entry in the series developed by the studio even launched. Considering the current pipeline of games geared towards yearly releases of Silent Hill games, the leaker speculates the remake could be released in 2027, following Silent Hill F, which launches this September, and the mysterious Townfall in 2026.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the Silent Hill remake was announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">last month</a> with a brief teaser trailer that sadly did not show the game. However, the music used in the trailer left no doubt that the project was indeed a remake of the first entry in the series, which was later officially confirmed by Konami itself. Nothing else is known about the game, but by looking at how the Silent Hill 2 remake turned out, there's no doubt that the game in in very good hands, as the Polish team developed a faithful reimagining of the original, and its best game to date, as highlighted by Chris in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/"> review.</a></p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>The Silent Hill remake is currently in development. Platforms and release date have yet to be confirmed.</p>
