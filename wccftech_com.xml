			<p>Yesterday, the so-called Nostalgia Drive Team released the first work-in-progress build of Left 4 Dead RTX NTD. This is based on the previous work done by modder xoxor4d, which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>The Nostalgia Drive Team describes Left 4 Dead RTX NTD as a visual overhaul of Valve's classic co-op first-person shooter game released in 2009, rebuilt with the NVIDIA RTX Remix platform (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-1-2-advanced-path-traced-particle-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just got a major update last month</a>, allowing modders to inject old games with enhanced fire and smoke effects through a path traced particle system). This fan-made visual revamp focuses specifically on the No Mercy campaign and reimagines its environments with high-resolution physically based rendering (PBR) materials, improved reflections, and manually recreated lighting to achieve a cinematic and atmospheric look.</p>



<p><strong>Technical Highlights</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full PBR material system</li>



<li>Manually re-lit scenes (RTX Remix cannot capture native lights)</li>



<li>Enhanced shadows, reflections, and surface roughness</li>



<li>Upgraded materials for buildings, interiors, and props</li>



<li>4K texture rebuilds and improved normal maps</li>



<li>Full RTX Remix runtime compatibility</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download the WIP build of Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NTD, which weighs 7.15GB, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/left-4-dead-2-rtx-by-nostalgia-drive-team/downloads/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-wip-build" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from ModDB</a>. However, the NTD team shared the following warnings and disclaimers:</p>



<p><em>This is not a complete remaster but a foundation for future RTX mods in terms of compatibility and visuals. Due to engine limitations and ongoing development, some assets may appear unfinished or darker.</em></p>



<p><em>Expect missing/dark skyboxes, rubber-like materials on some models, incomplete lighting setups, water surfaces that may look off, and CPU-heavy performance on animated meshes. Moreover, the renderer is currently forced to run single-threaded, Alpha foliage heavily impacts performance, software skinning causes CPU bottlenecks, and some effects are still unhandled or inaccurate.</em></p>



<p>If, on the other hand, you want to contribute to the project, the Nostalgia Drive Team seeks help in the following areas: materials, lighting, assets, and testing. Those interested in joining the team can contact the user Entity in the official RTX Remix Showcase Discord channel.</p>

			<p>Indie Barcelona-based developer Epictellers Entertainment announced that its turn-based cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight met and exceeded the minimum funding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Kickstarter</a> just eighty minutes after the campaign opened.</p>



<p>For the record, the minimum goal was €75K, but supporters have already pushed the campaign to around €280K as we speak. With 29 days left on the campaign, it's fair to imagine the developers will be able to get a far greater amount of funding when all is said and done.</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is based on Paizo's eponymous science fantasy setting originally introduced in 2017. Players can look forward to a party-based RPG where they will lead a legendary crew, shape their destiny with choices and, most importantly, save the galaxy. It has been described as Divinity: Original Sin meets Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>



<p>The premise is that the ship's captain has vanished just as the galaxy is facing annihilation. Players must then assemble a crew of misfits from across the stars. There are six unique companions, from android assassins to mystic prophets, each with personal stories and moral dilemmas. </p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight adapts the tabletop RPG's second edition and includes the following classes: soldier, envoy, operative, mystic, solarian, and witchwarper. Being a roleplaying game, leveling up and collecting alien gear to become more powerful will be the key.</p>



<p>Epictellers stressed that no choice is forbidden, yet everything has consequences. Factions will remember the crew's deeds, and the companions will judge the player's heart. Branching storylines ensure that no two adventures are alike.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Throughout the 40-60 hours of adventure, players will get to explore neon stations, undead worlds, digital gods, and cosmic dragons. The game features multiple difficulty settings (from a story mode to Nightmare), mod support, and community tools on PC, and a voice cast directed by Neil Newbon (who won multiple awards for his performance as Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3).</p>



<p>Starfinder: Afterlight is currently targeting a Q2 2026 launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245640/Starfinder_Afterlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. At that point, the game will feature Act 1 with around 10-15 hours of gameplay. The full release is loosely estimated to happen in 2027.</p>

			<p>With only two days left before Battlefield 6's official launch, the developers <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1975637378636144955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have shared</a> the full, detailed PC system requirements, ranging from Minimum to Ultra++.</p>



<p>As with all Battlefield games since 2008's Bad Company, Battlefield 6 is powered by DICE's own Frostbite engine. However, this time around, the development teams collectively known as Battlefield Studios (DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion) <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have explicitly focused on maximizing performance rather than, for instance, adding fancy visual features like ray tracing</a>.</p>



<p>Indeed, according to the developers, Battlefield 6 won't even need any upscalers before the Ultra++ preset, where they recommended using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to get 4K@144 frames per second at High Settings, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multi Frame Generation is needed</a> to achieve 4K@240 frames per second at Ultra Settings. That's on a GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card; notably, no AMD equivalent is listed for the Ultra++ preset.</p>
