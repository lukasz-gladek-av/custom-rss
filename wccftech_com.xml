<p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the first 3D entry in the series and is considered, still to this day, as one of the best entries in the series. As such, there's high demand for a modern remake of the game, but Nintendo seems more focused on working on new entries in the series rather than remaking older 3D games that would require way more work than the remasters released so far. Still, the remake released on Nintendo 3DS is a solid upgrade to the game, so it is definitely a game that's worth playing to experience a slightly modernized take on the classic N64 game.</p>

			<p>Sony is working on AI-powered versions of PlayStation characters that can respond to voice input from the player during gameplay, a new leaked video revealed.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> by an anonymous tipster before it got taken down on YouTube, shows an AI-powered version of the Horizon series protagonist Aloy that can respond to queries using synthesized voice and facial movements both in a demo setting and during Horizon Forbidden West gameplay, as highlighted by SIE director of software engineering Sharwin Raghoebardajal who demonstrated the technology in the removed video. The technology, powered by OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations, is augmented by Sony's internal Emotional Voice Synthesis system and by Mockingbird technology that handles audio-to-face animation.</p>
<p>While this AI-powered version of Aloy was developed to show the technology internally, there's a very good chance that we will eventually see it implemented even on consoles, as parts of the technology can run directly on PlayStation 5 with little overhead. This glimpse of what the technology is capable of achieving doesn't exactly provide hints at how it could be implemented to enhance gaming experiences, but there's little doubt that it will impact future games considerably, considering the direction the industry is taking and how the PlayStation 6, in particular, is said will go <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">all-out on AI.</a></p>
<p>Sony isn't the only major console manufacturer investing heavily in AI. Last week, Microsoft unveiled its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muse AI model</a> capable of generating gameplay. This&nbsp;should help developers, especially in the early stages of development, although the contrary is more likely, given the current state of the industry.</p>

			<p>Square Enix is planning to celebrate Chrono Trigger's 30th anniversary with various projects, according to a new post shared on social media today.</p>
<p>On the publisher's official Japanese <a href="https://x.com/squareenix_jp/status/1899298993613791338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1899298993613791338%7Ctwgr%5E28ba345c8804a38a6acfe4646e646ed32e8e603c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsquare-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> profile, Square Enix highlighted how today, March 11th, marks the 30th anniversary of the release of Chrono Trigger, a dream project that brought together the creator of the Final Fantasy series Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the Dragon Quest series Yuji Horii and the creator of Dragon Ball Akira Toriyama. To celebrate the game's 30th anniversary, the Japanese publisher is planning to launch various projects this year that will go beyond the world of the game to thank all those who have played the game.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger is among the few 16-bit-era JRPGs released by Square Enix that have yet to be properly remade. While the game was released with additional content on the Nintendo DS, which is also available in the Steam release, it was never effectively remade. Hopefully, in light of the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-already-sold-2-million-copies/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D remake</a> released last year, the Japanese publisher will consider at least an HD-2D remake of Chrono Trigger to introduce what is, in my opinion, one of the best JRPGs ever released, if not the very best, to a wider audience.</p>
<p>As of now, the only way to play Chrono Trigger on modern gaming hardware is on PC with the aforementioned Steam release. The game launched in a rather poor state back in 2018 but has since been improved with <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-update-3/">new features and enhancements</a>, making this version one of the best ways to enjoy the classic game.</p>
