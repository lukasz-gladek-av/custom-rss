			<p>In its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">earnings report</a> for the 2025 fiscal year, Ubisoft claims that the long-awaited Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake will arrive sometime in early 2026. But that's about the only good news Ubisoft has to share about its upcoming lineup of games, as chief executive officer Yves Guillemot says that some of the company's "<em>biggest</em>" titles have had their release windows pushed back.</p>
<p>Guillemot doesn't specify which games have been pushed back, just that they are major games.</p>
<p>"<em>Additionally, after review of our pipeline, we have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success,"</em> Guillemot said."<em>As a consequence, FY2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands</em>."</p>
<p>Ubisoft has already named <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/">2026 as a release window</a> for the Sands of Time Remake, but now we know to expect it before the end of Ubisoft's current 2026 fiscal year, which means sometime between January and March 2026.</p>
<p>But if you were waiting for games like The Division 3 or the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">Splinter-Cell Remake</a>, you could be waiting until 2028 to play either of those. Especially in the case of Splinter-Cell, since that series has been practically dormant for years already. It wouldn't be surprising if Ubisoft kept pushing it back to instead focus on keeping its bigger series like Far Cry and Assassin's Creed fed before finally getting around to giving Splinter-Cell the spotlight once again.</p>
<p>At least Prince of Persia: Sands of Time fans have something to look forward to, and with Summer Game Fest around the corner, it's possible we'll get our first look at the game soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-preview-out-now-epic-promises-vast-open-worlds-at-consistent-60hz/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games has released the Unreal Engine 5.6 preview to developers, who can download it via the Epic Games Launcher, <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux</a>.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine maker has shared bold claims of enabling vast, high-fidelity open worlds with a target baseline of 'consistent 60Hz' (frames per second). To begin with, Unreal Engine 5.6 provides developers with device profiles based on Fortnite's optimized settings to achieve 60fps on all supported platforms. The streaming performance has also been optimized when streaming content in and out of the world at runtime. Hopefully, this can help alleviate some of the stuttering issues often seen in UE-powered games.</p>
<p>Lumen-based hardware ray tracing has also been optimized, as detailed in this overview provided by Epic:</p>
<p><em>In Unreal Engine 5.6, Lumen Hardware Ray Tracing (HWRT) mode delivers even greater performance on current-generation hardware. These low-level optimizations ensure faster, more efficient rendering, bringing high-end visual fidelity and scalability that now matches the frame budget of the software ray tracing mode. This frees up valuable CPU resources on your target platform and overall helps achieve a more consistent 60hz frame rate. </em></p>
<p>This would be very useful in a game like <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, where Lumen hardware ray tracing is very heavy on the CPU. Of course, the game would need to be updated (and tested) in Unreal Engine 5.6, which is unlikely for a released game with no significant post-launch support plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.productboard.com/epicgames/1-unreal-engine-public-roadmap/tabs/124-unreal-engine-5-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There's a lot more in this preview</a>, like parallelization of the Renderer Hardware Interface (RHI) API, optimizations for virtual shadow maps, GPU Profiler 2.0, improved PCG GPU Compute performance, the addition of the MetaHuman Creator in-engine and what Epic has described as the largest expansion to the engine's animation authoring toolset yet.</p>
<p>Unreal Fest Orlando is coming up on June 3, and Epic will delve even deeper into the new features during the State of Unreal keynote. Meanwhile, developers are free to install Unreal Engine 5.6 but should be aware that it is still unstable; as such, projects should not be converted but copied from earlier versions to ensure work is not disrupted.</p>
<p>Of course, all the aforementioned improvements won't change the fundamental issue of Unreal Engine, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly recognized</a> by Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney: its reliance on single-threading. That will change with Unreal Engine 6, which is, however, still two to three years out from a preview.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">March</a>, Ubisoft announced that it had formed a new subsidiary with Tencent to house its Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. We've had some <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">leaked insight</a> into how this new subsidiary will be structured, but we finally got a more official update on what its focus will be moving forward.</p>
<p>In Ubisoft's <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">earnings report</a> for its 2025 fiscal year, the company said that this new subsidiary will "<em>focus on building brand ecosystems capable of becoming evergreen, billion-euro franchises</em>" by focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Improving the quality of narrative-driven solo experiences</em></li>
<li><em>Expanding live service offerings with richer multiplayer features and more frequent content updates</em></li>
<li><em>Significantly enhancing content creation by leveraging Ubisoft's technological stack</em></li>
<li><em>Scaling into underpenetrated markets such as mobile and China</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It's not surprising at all that part of this venture with Tencent will be Ubisoft trying to gain some footing in China's game market, or that Ubisoft is hoping to bolster its mobile portfolio. What we still don't know about this new subsidiary is how much it will impact Ubisoft developers.</p>
<p>Ahead of the notes about what this new subsidiary will focus on, Ubisoft's report says that it is "<em>currently working on reshaping its operating model with the objective to better meet player needs, deliver superior game quality and drive disciplined capital allocation. Management targets to announce new organization by the end of the year.</em>"</p>
<p>Later on in the report, Ubisoft says it will work to reduce costs through "<em>ongoing targeted restructurings</em>," which all point to more layoffs being announced by Ubisoft, sometime before the end of this year. Continuing the terrible string of mass layoffs that the video game industry has suffered over the last few years, with seemingly no end in sight.</p>
