			<p>After some time in Early Access on Steam, Hades II launches later this month on PC and Nintendo Switch systems.</p>



<p>As confirmed during today's Nintendo Direct, the highly anticipated second entry in the series will launch on September 25 on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. Going by how the first entry in the series eventually made its way to PlayStation and Xbox systems, it's unlikely Hades II will remain <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/">a Switch console exclusive </a>for long.</p>



<p>Besides announcing the game's release, today's Nintendo Direct also provided a new trailer that provides a solid overview of what Supergiant Games' roguelike offers. The trailer also provides some details on the Nintendo Switch 2 version, which will support 120 FPS gameplay at 1080p resolution in docked mode. You can check out this new trailer below.</p>

<p><em>The first-ever sequel from Supergiant Games builds on the best aspects of the original&nbsp;god-like&nbsp;rogue-like dungeon crawler in an all-new, action-packed, endlessly replayable experience rooted in the Underworld of Greek myth and its deep connections to the dawn of witchcraft.</em></p>



<p>Hades II launches on PC, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on September 25 worldwide. You can learn more about the excellent first entry in the series in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-damned-great/">review</a>.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-could-be-super-mario-galaxy-nintendo-universal/">predicted yesterday</a>, Nintendo has indeed debuted the first teaser for the sequel to the Super Mario Bros. Movie at today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">Nintendo Direct</a>, by announcing The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, set to premiere in April 2026.</p>



<p>The news was one of the opening announcements for the Direct, with Shigeru Miyamoto kicking things off with the 40th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros launching in Japan. A short teaser took players through the Mushroom Kingdom, up to Peach's Castle, and then into the sky to reveal the title.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Following the title's debut, Miyamoto passed the buck to Illumination chief executive officer and founder Chris Meledandri, who confirmed that the cast from the first Super Mario Bros. movie is returning, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek. </p>



<p>There were no other casting reveals or character reveals, so we'll just have to wait until closer to the film's premiere to see what's new in the film. What Meledandri did reveal is that the Super Mario Galaxy games are the movie's main inspiration for its story.</p>



<p>The film is still due to arrive in April 2026 as was previously announced, though, curiously, Nintendo did not list the previously confirmed April 2, 2026 date, which could mean that the film's premiere date has been slightly altered.</p>
