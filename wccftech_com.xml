			<p>It's been twelve and a half years since Irrational Games launched BioShock Infinite, the last installment in the immersive single player first-person shooter franchise. Franchise creator Ken Levine notoriously decided to disband the studio and form the much smaller Ghost Story Games, which is now working on Judas. Levine recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-similar-bioshock-some-ways-radically-different-in-others/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that Judas shares some similarities with the BioShock franchise, but it is also different in many ways.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Take-Two's publishing label 2K <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2019 that a brand new studio called Cloud Chamber, headquartered in Novato, California, would take stewardship of the BioShock IP. Cloud Chamber had its own fair share of troubles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebooting the project in 2023</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffering a big round of layoffs</a> (affecting around 80 employees) as recently as this August, which delayed the new BioShock to the latter half of 2027, according to credible sources.</p>



<p>The former Studio Head, Kelley Gilmore, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced by industry veteran Rod Fergusson</a>, who previously worked at Epic Games, The Coalition, and Blizzard, among others. Fergusson is known to be well-versed in taking over and focusing a studio's resources toward the successful completion of a game, and that's precisely what's needed here. Indeed, speaking during Take-Two's Q2 2026 earnings call (the same one that announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the delay of GTA VI</a>), CEO Strauss Zelnick said the game is now on a great track to take the franchise to the next level. Here's the quote:</p>



<p><em>We’re very excited that we brought Rod on to lead Cloud Chamber. He is the new head of the BioShock franchise. He’s obviously an incredible industry veteran. He’s got history with the BioShock franchise, specifically with Infinite. He’s also been involved with Gears of War and Diablo. We’re just so grateful that he’s come to work with us at Cloud Chamber. BioShock is a very important franchise for us. It’s one of our biggest franchises. We’re very excited about the release of the next BioShock. We’ve made some changes in the organization. We’re shifting some things around. Right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that’s going to exceed consumers’ expectations. Not much more to update other than the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises.</em></p>



<p>It may take a while, as mentioned above, but franchise fans will be able to tide themselves over with Judas (which is 'coming up', according to Zelnick, and is likely to be ready before the BioShock game) and the BioShock Netflix film adaptation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be directed by The Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence</a> and should begin production after Lawrence finishes shooting the next movie in that franchise (Sunrise on the Reaping).</p>
