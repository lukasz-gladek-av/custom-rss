			<p><strong>Nixxes Software</strong> has just shared the full PC system requirements for <strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>. Powered by the <strong>Decima Engine</strong> just like its predecessor (and the Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West games), the game appears to have reasonable specs. Nixxes has also introduced a Portable preset that will be aimed at handheld gaming devices, such as the Steam Deck and the ASUS ROG Ally.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will also include <strong>all of the main PC upscaling and frame generation options</strong>: <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong>, <strong>AMD FSR 4</strong>, and <strong>Intel XeSS 2</strong>. It was not, however, clarified whether the NVIDIA DLSS 4 implementation includes <strong>Multi Frame Generation</strong> and support for the new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS 4.5 second-generation Transformer model</a></strong> via the NVIDIA app. </p>



<p>There won't be any fancy new additions like ray tracing. However, there is native support for Ultrawide displays, with all of the cutscenes designed to be displayed in a 21:9 aspect ratio. The even wider 32:9 aspect ratio is also supported, but only during gameplay.</p>



<p>Even players with high-resolution 16:9 displays can enable widescreen aspect ratios in the display settings to experience the broader field of view, without requiring an ultrawide monitor. The option to play Death Stranding 2 in 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio will also be available on PS5 at the same time as the PC release via an update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Embark Studio's</strong> new <strong>Shrouded Sky</strong> update for <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> isn't a major expansion or anything, but it almost feels close to that kind of update, because it includes more than a few significant changes. A slew of weapons have been given nerfs to try and better balance PvP play, an element of progression that wasn't benefiting half of the player base is now gone, there are two new ARC threats to take down, and that's before getting to the fact that there's a whole hurricane for players to deal with now.</p>



<p>The update is now live, with the full <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">patch notes available on the game's official website</a> if you're looking to read through them in full. Some of the highlights are things we already heard about when Embark <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-raiders-hurricane-map-condition-arrives-in-shrouded-sky-update-next-week/">teased the update last week</a>, like the new <strong>Hurricane map condition</strong> and the benefits of braving an expedition Topside with winds raging and debris constantly flying across the map.</p>



<p>What we didn't know about until Embark started to provide more details about the update, just ahead of its release, is the introduction of <strong>two new ARC threats</strong>. One is called the <strong>Comet</strong>, which essentially acts like a bigger version of a <strong>Pop</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-guide-the-most-annoying-arcs-and-how-to-deal-with-them/">one of the ARCs to make our list of the most annoying ones to deal with</a>). Once a Comet spots you, it'll charge you and try to explode at your feet. </p>



<p>Its considerably larger size compared to a Pop makes it more deadly if you are unfortunate enough to get hit by its explosion, and the fact that it roams around outside means it's yet another ARC to be concerned about third-partying you, whether you're caught in a fight with other ARCs or Raiders. At least Pops are usually confined to specific areas. These will track and follow you if you're not careful.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The other new ARC is another aerial machine called a <strong>Firefly</strong>. Embark calls it "<em>a <strong>floating nightmare</strong></em>," because it's a flying version of a <strong>Fireball</strong>. A very literal take on the name 'Firefly,' this ARC will circle you like a <strong>Wasp</strong> or <strong>Hornet</strong>, but instead of a machine gun or electrical stun shot, it has a flamethrower attached to it, ready to burn you to a crisp. It's also armoured, so while the usual strategy of going for its thrusters still applies, you'll want to ensure you're carrying something with some heavy firepower to take it down quickly.</p>



<p>Also new in this update is a change to the <strong>Dam Battlegrounds</strong> map, with the introduction of a new "<em>high-security area</em>" with high-value loot called the <strong>Controlled Access Zone</strong>. There's also a new Project for Raiders to undertake, in which Shani asks you to collect resources to build a <strong>Weather Monitoring System</strong>, and like all other projects, you'll earn rewards with each new tier of the project you clear.</p>



<p>There are also new cosmetics to unlock with a new free <strong>Surgeon Raider Deck</strong>, which adds facial hair to character customization, and new cosmetic bundles like the new <strong>Volare Set</strong>, which is available alongside today's update, to be followed by the <strong>Devotee Set</strong> coming later.</p>

<p>As for the weapons getting nerfed, the <strong>Stitcher, Kettle, </strong>and <strong>Venator</strong> are all getting damage nerfs. All three are getting base damage reductions, with the Stitcher and Venator getting headshot damage reductions. The <strong>Jupiter</strong> and <strong>Aphelion</strong> are both getting buffed slightly, though not to their damage. You'll now be able to swap from the Jupiter to your secondary faster, while the Aphelion's reload time, time between shots, and recoil have all been reduced, and its ADS time has been improved. Essentially, it shoots faster, reloads faster, and it's faster to aim with.</p>



<p>There's also been a rebalancing of item values, and you can now craft Energy Clips at the Workbench by default. And on top of all of that, there is a slew of bug changes to check out in the patch notes, including fixing the bug that caused players to have to close and re-open the game because they earned a skill point after their last match, and it didn't properly register.</p>

			<p>While it left something to be desired at launch, the <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR</strong> upscaler is still very notable tech as it is the first <strong>AI-powered upscaler</strong> to be available on a home console. In the months since the system's release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-better-image-quality-taa/"><strong>the upscaler has been consistently improved</strong></a> to deliver better image quality, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/"><strong>a future version</strong></a> could introduce some <strong>significant changes</strong> that would prevent <strong>frame rate drops</strong> in essentially every game.</p>



<p>As spotted by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-pssr-breakthrough/">Tech4Gamers</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sony Interactive Entertainment</strong> filed a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=EP472304947&amp;_fid=GB472369583"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new patent</strong></a> on February 4 detailing some new features that could be part of the upcoming <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PSSR 2.0</strong>. Chief among them is the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dynamic scaling of the AI's precision</strong>. The system monitors the console's processing <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">GPU</strong> and <strong>CPU</strong> in real-time and automatically adjusts how expensive the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI upscaling</strong> is based on the game's current load. </p>



<p>For example, if a scene is incredibly complex, featuring some elements like a massive explosion or a huge number of NPCs, the system can slightly lower the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">AI's precision</strong> for the upscaling process to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">save the frame rate</strong>. When the load drops, the precision is brought back up for maximum visual clarity. This also means that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">internal resolution</strong> of games doesn't need to be dropped to keep the frame rate stable, which would be a massive breakthrough for console gaming.</p>



<p><em>"The accuracy of the ANN inference is reduced through a reduction of the precision of the weights and/or activations of the model. However, this reduction […] is acceptable in order to maintain a stable gaming experience (e.g. smooth perceived animation and maintained resolution) for the user,"</em> the patent details. <em>"When an application or game has a high load point then the framerate of the MFSR graphics output can suffer, leading to a reduced quality experience for the user. This is particularly problematic in fast-paced games."</em></p>



<p>Needless to say, this new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">PSSR</strong> breakthrough sounds incredibly promising, not just for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5 Pro</strong>, which could indeed become a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">4K resolutio</strong><strong>n</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">, 120 FPS machine</strong></a> with it, but for future hardware such as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/playstation-6-everything-we-know-release-date-specs-price-games/">PlayStation 6</a></strong> and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation handheld</strong>. With games nowadays being built with upscaling in mind, future versions of the upscaler could give Sony's next-generation systems an edge over the competition.</p>

			<p>Exactly two weeks ago, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-could-be-merged-with-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that sources inside <strong>Microsoft</strong> pointed to an early plan to potentially add more third-party services to <strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong>, in a bid to make it more appealing. After the <strong>shocking price increase to</strong> <strong>$30</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went live on October 1, 2025</a>, many Xbox gamers feel it isn't worth it anymore, even with the inclusion of <strong>Fortnite Crew</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft+ Classics</strong>, hence why Microsoft might be looking to add value.</p>



<p>Interestingly, a new rumor comes from WindowsCentral's Jez Corden. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ROeswcSpCiQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a YouTube livestream</a>, he mentioned Warren's report while adding that he heard Microsoft is also considering the addition of first-party services, such as the <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>, <strong>Minecraft Realms</strong>, <strong>Fallout 1st</strong>, and <strong>Elder Scrolls Online Plus</strong> subscriptions.</p>



<p><em>I think there is an opportunity to make Game Pass Ultimate worth the money. There was a report recently from Tom Warren in his newsletter on The Verge; he said something along the lines of, Microsoft's looking at ways to add even more value to Game Pass. I think making it like there are more reasons to subscribe at $30 is probably a race against time for them right now, where they're like, "We need to make this work and make people feel like it's worthwhile". </em></p>



<p><em><strong>One thing I did hear, and I don't know if this would ever happen, but one thing I did hear</strong> - this is something I get asked a lot - <strong>is they were exploring putting the World of Warcraft and some of the other subscriptions they got, like Fallout 1st, Minecraft Realms...They were exploring putting that in Game Pass Ultimate</strong>. Now, if they did that, if they put World of Warcraft, Minecraft Realms, Fallout 1st, and the Elder Scrolls [Online Plus] subscription, if they put all that into Game Pass Ultimate, then oh boy, does it become worth it then for me at $30. </em></p>



<p>Then, answering a viewer's question on the same topic, he added:</p>



<p><em>I kind of just addressed that. It does seem like they're going to eventually integrate some of the subscription into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, but we'll see if it actually happens.</em></p>



<p>Using the subscriptions of first-party companies to add value to Game Pass Ultimate seems like a smart move, although Microsoft will definitely look carefully into the economics to see if it's feasible. Almost certainly, it wouldn't be possible to bundle all those into Game Pass Ultimate without touching up the individual services. Still, here's what each of them costs and offers right now:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Subscription</th><th data-align="left">Monthly Price</th><th data-align="left">Annual Price</th><th data-align="left">What's Included</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</strong></td><td data-align="left">$29.99</td><td data-align="left">N/A (monthly only)</td><td data-align="left">Xbox + PC Game Pass library, online multiplayer, EA Play, cloud gaming, Fortnite Crew, Ubisoft+ Classics​</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>World of Warcraft</strong></td><td data-align="left">$14.99</td><td data-align="left">$155.88 ($12.99/mo)</td><td data-align="left">Access to all WoW retail + Classic content, latest expansion excluded​</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Minecraft Realms Plus</strong></td><td data-align="left">$7.99</td><td data-align="left">N/A (monthly only)</td><td data-align="left">Private server for you + up to 10 players, 150+ rotating Marketplace content packs​</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Fallout 1st</strong></td><td data-align="left">$12.99</td><td data-align="left">$99.99</td><td data-align="left">Private world (up to 8 players), Scrapbox, Survival Tent, 1,650 Atoms/month, exclusive cosmetics​</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>ESO Plus</strong></td><td data-align="left">$14.99</td><td data-align="left">$139.99</td><td data-align="left">All previously released DLC game packs and dungeon (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-interview-free-content-battle-pass/">future content additions will be free since the switch to Seasons</a></strong>); Craft Bag, 1,650 Crowns/month, double bank space; Tamriel Tome battle pass premium tokens, increased transmute crystal cap, housing furnishing limit increases</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
