			<p>The list of games and applications that feature RTX technologies continues to grow, with games having access to NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and advanced ray-tracing integration. This makes those who have GeForce RTX cards have a prettier and more immersive experience. With more than <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600 games and applications</a> utilizing these technologies, there is no sign of the list slowing down any time soon. This week, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-2-void-crew-towers-of-aghasba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three more games</a> joined the ever-expanding list, with more to come in the future. This week sees Void Crew, War Thunder and Towers of Aghasba join the list of games featuring<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-extensive-preview-of-nvidia-rtx-effects-and-performance/"> RTX technologies</a>. Below is a breakdown of how you can expect to utilize them in the game.</p>
<p>Void Crew has just been released from early access and is a fun co-op roguelite title from Hutlihut Games and Focus Entertainment where you get to play as a METEM-chosen clone warrior, where you and your friends have to embark on a Pilgrimage. As you explore and get deeper into the unknown, you come across the HOLLOW, an alien force like no other. It's up to you and your friends to face off against them to try and bring peace back to the people. Void Crew will be utilizing DLSS Super Resolution, allowing GeForce RTX gamers to accelerate the performance of the game with the advanced technology.</p>
<p>Next up on the list is War Thunder. This game is far from new, as it was first released in 2013. However, since its release, it's received a new coat of paint and looks better than ever. There are hundreds of tanks, ground military vehicles, planes, and warships that will look even better by using DLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA Reflex. War Thunder just received a new update, which also added support for hardware-accelerated ray-tracing effects to make the game even more immersive and stunning. These options include ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced water, and ray-traced shadows, for example.</p>
<p>Finally, Towers of Aghasba is the latest game to join the roster of games with RTX technology integration. This game is hot off the press and is currently in Early Access. In this game, you get to explore an open-world with fascinating flora and fauna. You will meet some interesting characters along the way, and you can help breathe life into the world, as well as create your very own island civilization. If you are playing this title, you will be able to use DLSS Super Resolution for a faster and smoother experience in Towers of Aghasba.</p>

			<p>New Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro improvements are being researched by developer Remedy Entertainment, but it will take the team weeks to implement them.</p>
<p>Following the release of today's new <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2.5 update</a>, which introduces some improvements to the base game and Night Springs and The Lake House expansions alongside some fixes, the Finnish studio commented on the lack of PlayStation 5 Pro-specific improvements, saying that player feedback is being heard, and more research is being done on how to improve performance. As the game's PlayStation 5 Pro support was the work of many months, it will take the team more than just a few weeks to implement changes and improvements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">üõ†Ô∏è A new update for Alan Wake 2 has been released. It includes (fingers crossed) fixes for the missing Pat Maine radio shows, and more fixes, improvements and additions.</p>
<p>As always, update notes are here: <a href="https://t.co/zqW9QhguFF">https://t.co/zqW9QhguFF</a></p>
<p>Please allow additional time for the update to‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/DO5Fyl2dnI">pic.twitter.com/DO5Fyl2dnI</a></p>
<p>‚Äî Alan Wake 2 (@alanwake) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1861394569448894731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the Alan Wake 2 PlayStation 5 Pro patch has the merit of finally bringing ray tracing to a console version of the game, the improvements are far from the best we have seen among all Pro-enhanced titles. PSSR, in particular, struggles to deliver significantly better image quality than on the base console, showing how the upscaler currently isn't a good fit for 4K resolution with a low internal resolution like that of the game. Hopefully, Remedy Entertainment will be able to work some of its magic in the future and enhance this version of the game to deliver better image quality and performance.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">review.</a></p>
