			<p><a href="https://x.com/leaks_infinite/status/1977781382563745995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to leaker Halo Leaks</a>, the rumored new Halo: Combat Evolved edition is getting the full remake treatment, similar to CAPCOM's latest Resident Evil games. This includes the ability for the main character, Master Chief, to sprint (which was, of course, absent in the original game) and modern gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p><em>I can definitely confirm the Halo: Combat Evolved Remake will have sprint &amp; "modern gameplay mechanics". I'm of the belief its gameplay will be similar to the new Halo Multiplayer game, which I also believe is Halo 7's MP. It's a full remake similar to the Resident Evil remakes.</em></p>



<p>This would inevitably change how the game plays compared to the 2001 game, which was initially launched on the first Xbox. Then again, <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-anniversary-now-available-on-pc-as-part-of-mcc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there's already the Anniversary edition</a> for those who would prefer sticking with that.</p>



<p>Earlier rumors suggest the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could launch in 2026</a> and only feature the single player campaign, ditching the multiplayer modes. The 2026 date tracks, as Microsoft previously mentioned that they wanted to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Xbox with its core franchises, including Gears of War: E-Day, the Fable reboot, the new Forza Horizon game, and of course, Halo itself.</p>



<p>Other recent rumors have <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed to Abstraction</a>, a Virtuos studio, helping Halo Studios with the development. The Halo: Combat Evolved remake will allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-ue5-blam-engine-gameplay-tweaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use a combination of Unreal Engine 5 and the original Blam engine</a>, just like Oblivion Remastered (also co-developed by Virtuos), which mixed UE5 and the Creation engine. </p>



<p>The developers had previously teased fans that more information on their next project would be revealed during the Halo World Championship (HWC) 2025, which will take place from October 24 to 26, in Seattle, Washington, at the Seattle Convention Center. In around ten days we'll know whether the Halo: Combat Evolved remake rumors were correct, although everything points in that direction, for sure.</p>

			<p>When Bethesda revealed and surprise-dropped The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, it was a cause of concern for at least two other game studios. One was Sandfall Interactive, which was understandably concerned about their debut game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, being overshadowed by the Oblivion Remaster. The other, as we now know from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-inside-story-of-how-oblivion-remastered-caused-immense-worry-then-sublime-relief-for-the-industrious-devs-behind-mod-megaproject-skyblivion">a new mini-documentary courtesy of Eurogamer</a>, was, even more understandably, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">the Skyblivion mod development team</a>.</p>



<p>And in both cases, the concern quickly faded to relief. In the case of Sandfall Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">the word-of-mouth around both games that week actually helped Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 commercially</a>. For Skyblivion, which is still in the works, it was a different kind of relief, the relief of knowing that Bethesda wasn't doing something that would actually get in their way.</p>

<p>"<em>It was not set in stone whether it was a 'remake' or a 'remaster,' so we were concerned,</em>" said Dee Keyes, former world designer on Skyblivion and member of the development team. "<em>It was a huge relief because we realized, 'Oh, they're doing something completely different.</em>' <em>They're doing a faithful remaster, and we were going for something more remade from the ground up</em>."</p>



<p>Since the release of Oblivion Remastered, Bethesda has shown the Skyblivion team plenty of love and appreciation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">not only giving each of them codes for Oblivion Remastered</a> when it released, but later <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-shows-even-more-support-to-the-skyblivion-mod-team-hosts-them-at-rockville-headquarters/">inviting the team to Bethesda's headquarters in Rockville</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, the Skyblivion team <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/">confirmed that it is in the "<em>final stretch</em>" on the mod's development</a>, and also <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-first-15-minutes-shared-new-video/">shared the first 15 minutes of gameplay</a> that players will get to experience when the mod is finally ready and in their hands.</p>
