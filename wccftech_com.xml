			<p>British actor Charlie Cox was among those who received a nomination for their work on the game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards.</p>



<p>Cox, a renowned film and TV actor whose credits include Stardust, Boardwalk Empire, The Theory of Everything, Daredevil, Kin, and Treason, was featured for the first time in a videogame in the role of Gustave, a resourceful engineer with a mechanical arm. In a reaction to the nomination news, though, he noted that most of the credits for Gustave should really go to the motion actor instead of himself.</p>



<p>At a recent panel hosted during the Mexican convention LaConve 64 in Monterrey, as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Posta Entretenimiento</a>, Charlie Cox said:</p>



<p><em>Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination. I have said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role. So, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process.</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first time the actor has shrugged off the accolades that came his way for the role of Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Charlie Cox previously admitted that he's not a gamer, did not play the game, and only spent about four hours in the studio doing the voiceover after his agent signed him up for it, which now made him feel like a 'total fraud' when people praised him.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already won seven prizes at the Golden Joystick Awards</a>, including two for the performers (Jennifer English for Maelle and Ben Starr for Verso). It's set to win many more at The Game Awards and elsewhere throughout the award season.</p>



<p>As for Charlie Cox, fans are already wondering if he'll be in the already announced movie adaptation. He might have some competition from Glen Powell, though, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollywood-star-glen-powell-loves-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he played and loved the game.</p>
