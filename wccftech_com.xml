			<p>The next game directed by <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>, the Game Director behind 2007's <strong>God of War II</strong> and 2018's <strong>God of War</strong>, wasn't shown at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 State of Play</a>. However, according to two of the most reliable insiders, it is targeting a <strong>Summer reveal</strong> ahead of a <strong>tentative 2027 release</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>NatetheHate</strong> <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2022409747539071233?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted as much on X</a>, while adding that he will probably be able to share more information about the project in the future:</p>



<p><em>Cory is working on his own project and it remains unannounced. I'll share more when I can. We will hear about it before 2027. My expectation is around Summer.</em> <em>Unless a major delay happens, the game will be out in 2027.</em></p>



<p>Another renowned insider, <strong>Shinobi602</strong>, <strong>corroborated this </strong>on the ResetEra gaming board, where someone surmised that Cory Barlog's game might be targeting 2028 while a smaller team prepares for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly announced <strong>God of War remake trilogy</strong></a>. However, the insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151277215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>:</p>



<p><em>Not that far (barring any delays, of course).</em> <em>Like I said, given the quarter they're targeting, I do expect that [it will be announced this year]. Probably May State of Play or the summer Keighleys (SGF). As of now, I don't know yet. If not by then, then they've either pushed the release out further or doing a shorter reveal to release.</em></p>



<p>In September 2021, Cory Barlog <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> he wouldn't direct <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, leaving that role to <strong>Eric Williams</strong>. He was still credited as Creative Director and Producer for that game, but he also began working on another game that, <strong>several years later, remains shrouded in secrecy</strong>. There have been rumors that it could take place in a sci-fi setting, but it's nothing solid.</p>



<p>The only solid rumor came in July 2025 from Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that <strong>the project was going well</strong> and that while it is not technically a new intellectual property, <strong>it might feel like it</strong>. This appears to be a hint that Barlog and his team at Sony Santa Monica are <strong>possibly working on a PlayStation IP that is being revived</strong> after a long slumber. If the insiders are correct, we're only a few months away from the announcement, anyway. Stay tuned.</p>
