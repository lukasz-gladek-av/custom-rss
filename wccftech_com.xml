			<p>There were some major announcements today during the Capcom Spotlight broadcasts, which was then followed by a Monster Hunter Wilds showcase that unveiled even more details about the upcoming game and what players can expect. It was also announced that there will be a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second Open Beta Test</a> for Monster Hunter Wilds later this month, where those who participate will be able to challenge Arkveld, as well as the opportunity to hunt the "White Wraith." There are some returning monsters, too. However, Monster Hunter Wilds wasn't the only thing that Capcom showed off during these showcases.</p>
<p>New details for <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> have been announced, as Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Director Satoru Nihei joined the show to give fans more details about the story. The title follows the story of a new protagonist who is wielding the Oni Gauntlet, and will have to fight off the demonic Genma. This title is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam in 2026.</p>
<p>Not only were there details for Onimusha: Way of the Sword, but it's also been confirmed that Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is receiving a remaster and is currently in development. Fans got a sneak peek of this 2002 title with enhanced graphics during the Capcom Spotlight with a trailer.
