			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, the global data firm that tracks videogame industry sales data and <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-of-worlds-gamers-drive-nearly-half-global-gaming-spend-north-america-europe-newzoo/">market trends</a> has published its <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-global-games-market-report-2025">Global Games Market Report for 2025</a>, which includes plenty of interesting trends and predictions from Newzoo, and also reveals that it'll be videogame consoles, not mobile, that leads the growth in this year's videogame market, thanks to a boost from the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>One of the major headlines in the report is that the videogame industry will reach $188.8 billion in revenue in 2025, a 3.4% growth compared to 2024. For the mobile portion of the market, it'll generate $103 billion this year, a 2.9% growth from last year, with mobile games still representing the biggest chunk of the industry's revenue at 55%.</p>



<p>Another interesting layer Newzoo points out is that videogame players will make up 60% of the world's population, with 3 billion players on mobile, 936 million on PC, and 645 million on consoles, making for a total of 3.58 billion players across all gaming platforms worldwide.</p>



<p>A chunk of those will, of course, be playing on Nintendo Switch 2, but even with consoles driving revenue this year, mobile players are still the dominating force when it comes to the worldwide videogame playing population.</p>



<p>Newzoo also includes predictions for what the industry will look like in the next three years, saying that by 2028, the total market revenue will grow to $206.5 billion, with consoles predicted to have the biggest growth, not just from new hardware, but new major game releases like the coming Grand Theft Auto VI launch. Between consoles, PC, and mobile, Newzoo predicts consoles will have the most revenue growth at 4.7%.</p>



<p>Newzoo's player predictions for 2028 have console players growing to 688 million, and PC players passing the 1 billion mark for the first time in the industry's history. However, mobile players will still grow the by the largest amount, and at a faster rate than PC and console player growth.</p>



<p>"<em>2025 shows a market that's maturing - but no stagnating</em>," Newzoo writes in its concluding thoughts. "<em>Growth is there, it's just harder won. The winners will be the ones who lean into timing, retention, and ecosystem strength, not just the raw pursuit of new players</em>."</p>

			<p>Embark Studios has revealed and launched Season 8 for The Finals, bringing new enhancements to the in-game destruction that helped make the game popular in the first place, two new weapons that players have been waiting for, and more.</p>



<p>Season 8, titled Game Time, adds what Embark Studios is calling "<em>Smooth Destruction</em>" to The Finals. Per a press release from Embark Studios, you'll now see elements in-game like "<em>cranes cutting through buildings and suspended structures reacting more realistically with massive impact</em>."</p>



<p>The two new weapons coming to The Finals in Season 8 are a P90 SMG for the Medium class and a BFR Revolver for the Heavy class. The P90 is especially significant for The Finals, since it's the first SMG being introduced to the Medium class, and will likely have a major impact on the game's meta.</p>



<p>Embark Studios also debuted a new trailer for Season 8 of The Finals, showing off the new destruction elements and the new weapons. </p>

<p>Other quality-of-life improvements in Season 8 include the addition of an instant replay that show what your opponent saw during an intense moment, the arrival of mouse and keyboard controls for players on consoles, and a new match recap landing page that is meant to give you more detailed and easy-to-read stats from your previous match.</p>



<p>And of course, there will also be a new battle pass for players to work through in Season 8 with a slew of cosmetics to grab, including a few new cosmetic areas that can help you stand out even more when jumping into the arena.</p>
