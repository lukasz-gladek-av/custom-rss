			<p>Microsoft just now <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1877354722916458694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the date for this year's Xbox Developer Direct. The annual appointment to show some of this year's first-party games coming to PC and Xbox consoles will take place on January 23 at 10 AM Pacific Time / 1 PM Eastern Time / 6 PM UK / 7 PM Central European Time via the Xbox social channels.</p>
<p>Microsoft also unveiled the game lineup that fans can expect to see showcased at the event. By far the most anticipated of the bunch is id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages. The eighth installment in the main series and the third following 2016's DOOM and 2020's DOOM Eternal will actually function as a prequel, demonstrating the origin story of the Slayer in a medieval inspired setting. PlayStation 5 users will want to tune in for this one, too, since it will be available on Sony's console as well from day one. The PC version will deliver the most advanced visuals, though, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation support and path traced graphics, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at CES 2025.</p>
<p>Another game featured in the Xbox Developer Direct is <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-compulsion-games-upcoming-deep-south-folktale-receives-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>. This is a new IP from Compulsion Games, the Canadian studio behind Contrast and We Happy Few. South of Midnight features unique stop-motion-like graphics, a setting inspired by deep South folk tales, and an action/adventure framework that, however, puts the emphasis on narrative rather than gameplay. The game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to launch in March, and if that's the case, it will definitely be announced during this broadcast.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Microsoft is also hosting a third-party game this year. It's the intriguing <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-next-spring-with-an-incredible-voice-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a JRPG featuring a mix of turn-based combat and real-time elements in development at French studio Sandfall Interactive. The game will be available on Game Pass, which likely explains the inclusion here.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Microsoft has teased a 'visit to a surprise location to see another studio's brand new game'. It's really anyone's guess as to what it could be, but we're definitely intrigued.</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco has announced that a network test for the upcoming standalone multiplayer game Elden Ring Nightreign will take place next month. Sign-ups will begin tomorrow <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on this page</a>, but the test is for consoles (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X) only, so if you're a PC player, you're currently out of luck.</p>
<p>Here's the brief description provided for the network test:</p>
<p><em>The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch. Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was among the most surprising announcements <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> during last month's The Game Awards 2024 event. FromSoftware is crafting something they've never attempted before. While the foundation is obviously the award-winning Elden Ring, it is being greatly tweaked to deliver a unique multiplayer experience that takes some elements from the survival and even battle royale genres. Here's the official description shared in the press release:</p>
<p><em>Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own unique abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide. At the end of each night, they will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate on the third night, when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the ELDEN RING universe. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat; unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</em></p>
<p><em>In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards and Limveld itself are all ever shifting and evolving each session in the realm of the Nightlord. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Find Sites of Grace to give each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the realm of the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Hero in this parallel world.</em></p>
<p>Are you excited about checking out Elden Ring Nightreign in February?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-renders-based-on-new-information-from-proven-tech-leaker-provide-updated-look-at-system%E2%80%99s-design-controllers.1077864/</guid>

			<p>A new look at the yet-to-be-officially revealed Nintendo Switch 2 has come today, thanks to the renders put together by a well-known tech leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OnLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnLeaks</a>, who has previously put together accurate renders for tech products before their official reveal, created these new renders on behalf of <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">91mobiles</a> which are based on new data, including the supposed dimensions of the real console. A 360-degree video, which can be watched below, provides another great look at the system, the U-shaped kickstand, and the Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 | First Look | 360 Degree Video | Exclusive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KAbXItlrUnQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides the new look at the console's design provided by OnLeaks' renders and 360-degree video, today we have learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 may indeed use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/">microSD Express format</a> as <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-storage-samsung-sd-express-micrso-sd-cards-800-mb-s/">previously rumored</a>. This new standard can reach a sequential read speed of up to 800MB/s, four times faster than traditional UHS-1 memory cards, whose read speed is capped at 200 MB/s. The console adopting this new standard is hardly surprising, considering how multiplatform games are nowadays developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S SSDs.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but with leaks coming in daily, there's no doubt that the reveal is imminent. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
