<p>Gearbox is about to launch Borderlands 4, a new installment in its most lucrative franchise by far. It's been six years since Borderlands 3, although there were the spin-offs fantasy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and the forgettable adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/new-tales-from-the-borderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Tales from the Borderlands</a>, both released in 2021, in between.</p>



<p>Let's recap everything we have learned about the game from the developers since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/">unveiling</a> at Gamescom 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions<br></h2>



<p>In February, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Borderlands 4 would debut on September 23. However, in late April, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought it forward to September 12</a>. At the time, most believed that publisher Take-Two Interactive had dictated the move due to the imminent launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, then still scheduled for Fall 2025. However, Gearbox president Randy Pitchford was quick to state that the date change <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-denies-rumor-that-borderlands-4-launching-early-has-to-do-with-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had nothing to do with GTA VI</a>, and he was proven right mere days later, when Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> GTA VI's delay to May 26, 2026. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2, although users of the latter platform will have to wait a bit more to play the game. Unlike most games nowadays, there won't be any 'early access' for those wishing to purchase more expensive editions. However, said editions do come with many perks.</p>



<p>The Standard edition is priced at $69.99. The Deluxe Edition costs $99.99 and includes the <strong>Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin</strong> and the <strong>Bounty Pack Bundle</strong>, which consists of the following post-launch Borderlands 4 content:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 unique areas, featuring new missions and unique bosses</li>



<li>4 Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards</li>



<li>New gear and weapons</li>



<li>New Vault Hunter cosmetics</li>



<li>4 New vehicles with new cosmetics</li>
</ul>



<p>The Super Deluxe Edition is priced at $129.99 and adds the following to the above:</p>



<p><strong>Ornate Order Pack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>4 Vault Hunter Skins</li>



<li>4 Vault Hunter Heads</li>



<li>4 Vault Hunter Bodies</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Vault Hunter Pack</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>2 new playable Vault Hunters</li>



<li>2 new Story Packs, featuring all new story and side missions</li>



<li>2 new map regions</li>



<li>New gear and weapons</li>



<li>New Vault Hunter cosmetics</li>



<li>New ECHO-4 cosmetics</li>
</ul>



<p>All editions of Borderlands 4, if pre-ordered, will provide access to the <strong>Gilded Glory Pack bundle</strong>, which consists of 1 Vault Hunter Skin, 1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin, and 1 Weapon Skin.</p>

<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>The franchise can be considered the original looter shooter, and this new installment will be no exception. </p>



<p>However, the setting is different from the previous titles. Long gone is the planet Pandora, which had been the focus of every game in the series except for New Tales from the Borderlands. This new entry follows directly from the ending of Borderlands 3, where Lilith uses her Siren powers to teleport the moon Elpis away (saving Pandora in the process). An unintended consequence is that Elpis's arrival in the orbit of the planet Kairos destroys the planet's protective barrier, making it visible to everyone after a very long time of staying hidden.</p>



<p>Kairos is a planet ruled through fear and oppression by a dictator named The Timekeeper. However, the uncloaking caused by the moon Elpis sparked chaos and uprisings. Players take the role of a Vault Hunter who ends up leading the resistance against The Timekeeper while, of course, seeking various alien artifacts. Borderlands 4 is also going to shift the series' trademark humor a bit. It will still be there, mostly in side content, but the main storyline will be a bit more serious than fans are used to due to the dictatorship theme.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Like its predecessors, the game will focus heavily on shooting and looting. However, the new installment offers several enhancements. To start with, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-more-vertical-and-lets-you-go-anywhere-and-thats-why-it-doesnt-have-a-minimap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the map is the biggest and most seamless in the franchise, allowing players to explore freely. There's a lot more verticality, too, which players will be able to exploit thanks to climbing, the grappling hook, and gliding. Other movement options include dashing, sliding, and double jumping. </p>



<p>Because of the exploration changes, the developers have opted to use a Bethesda-style compass rather than the mini-map seen in previous Borderlands games. They did not completely close the door to adding the feature post-launch if the fans really want it, though. Exploring Kairos will be spiced up by dynamic weather and events. Furthermore, players will be able to command their own vehicle to reach further destinations more quickly.</p>



<p>In terms of combat changes, Borderlands 4 introduces a new ordnance slot, which groups together grenades and heavy weaponry, including rocket launchers. These weapons can be fired or thrown until the ammo is depleted. Then, they possess cooldown timers that refill the ammo and the ability to activate again over a short timeframe. There are also new repair kits that can regenerate health or provide other benefits, such as increased elemental damage, fire rate, and movement speed.</p>



<p>At launch, Borderlands 4 will offer four playable characters to choose from:</p>



<p><strong>Vex the Siren</strong> - She had a hard life, fending for herself for her entire life. This perhaps explains her cynical and sarcastic nature, but beneath her rough exterior and general pessimism, she still believes in helping others. If helping means blasting oppressive jerks, all the better.</p>



<p><strong>Rafa the Exo-Soldier</strong> - He was born and raised in microgravity, which altered his bone density and musculature so severely that he could not survive anywhere else. However, Rafa was desperate to explore and enlisted in Tediore's military. In exchange for a tour of duty, his body was modified to fit a new exosuit. However, when it became clear that Tediore never intended to release him from service, he went on the run, planning to enjoy whatever time he has left before his Tediore Deadframe ends him for good.</p>



<p><strong>Harlowe the Gravitar</strong> - A former Maliwan combat scientist, she is driven by the need to understand how things work. This initially made her an outcast among her Traunt relatives, but she has used her intellect to bring new technology and gadgets to the battlefield as a Vault Hunter. Her brilliance is evident in everything she does, as is her enthusiasm and love for life.</p>



<p><strong>Amon the Forgeknight</strong> - He was raised in a Vault monster-worshipping cult until the Vault opened and the creature turned on everyone he loved. The only survivor of the ensuing carnage, he dedicates his life to finding and killing as many of these beasts as he possibly can. At heart, Amon is a warrior-poet who is introspective and unflinching in his duty. Despite his rugged appearance, he has a warm attitude and often shares stories and advice from his travels with his comrades.</p>



<p>At least two additional playable characters will be introduced to Borderlands 4 at some point after launch. As with previous franchise entries, the game will support cooperative gameplay for up to four players, this time with cross-play between all platforms.</p>

<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5. Gearbox has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassured</a> fans that the Nintendo Switch 2 is powerful enough to run the game well.</p>



<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official PC system requirements</a> aren't the most taxing we've seen for an Unreal Engine 5 game:</p>



<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br><em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br><em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br><em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br><em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br><em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br><em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br><em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br><em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br><em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br><em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>



<p>So far, Gearbox hasn't officially partnered with AMD or NVIDIA for Borderlands 4, but that may change before launch. If it does, we'll update this article.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is about to launch the second big first-party exclusive Switch 2 game: Donkey Kong Bananza. Earlier this week, the development team confirmed that Donkey Kong Bananza started development on the original Switch just like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>. </p>



<p>Why did they make it an exclusive, though, rather than a cross-generation title? Here's an answer provided by Nintendo EPD Game Director Kazuya Takahashi in an interview with Spanish website <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">Lavanguardia</a>:</p>



<p><em>As we mentioned before, we wanted to create continuity through the chain of destruction, and to achieve this, we needed to include a large number of destructible objects. This was only possible on Nintendo Switch 2, which allowed for the placement of so many elements on screen, as well as various materials and large-scale destruction. Additionally, to enhance the sense of satisfaction of destruction, we put a lot of effort into the effects and sounds, as well as the appearance of the objects being destroyed.</em></p>



<p>The interviewer pointed out that, after going hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza, it looked like there were some frame rate issues in the preview build. Here's what Takahashi had to say about that:</p>



<p><em>There are several factors to consider. First, we intentionally used effects like hit-stop and slow motion to emphasize impacts. Second, because we use voxel technology, there are times when there are major changes and destruction in the environment. We're aware that performance may drop slightly at these times. However, as you say, overall the game is smooth, and at points where large-scale changes occur, we prioritized fun and playability.</em></p>



<p>It doesn't sound like they are at all worried about it. We'll know more about the severity of the performance problems and indeed about the game as a whole next week, given that Nintendo is launching Donkey Kong Bananza on Thursday, July 17.</p>



<p>Look forward to our review when the embargo drops. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our hands-on preview</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Need for Speed Franchise May Have Been Shelved by Electronic Arts]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-may-have-been-shelved-by-ea/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report, the Need for Speed franchise may have been shelved by Electronic Arts. The news comes from a rather unlikely place, albeit theoretically trustworthy all the same. </p>



<p>Matthew Everingham, one of the contributors to the website <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speedhunters</a>, relayed the following message <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL8zRnrTSwl/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Instagram</a>:</p>



<p><em>Speedhunters is on ice. EA shelved Need For Speed, and that means no more funding for the site.</em></p>



<p><em>Grateful for everything — the trips, the stories, the lifelong mates. I'm still shooting, just shifting gears into more video.</em></p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with Speedhunters, it is 'an international collective of photographers, writers and drivers with a shared passion for uncovering the world's most exciting car culture stories.' It was seemingly funded by Electronic Arts, for some reason, and it hasn't been updated in over three months, with the last post now dated April 8, 2025.</p>



<p>Truth be told, this probably doesn't come as a complete shock to Need for Speed fans. The series has gone through a series of middling releases, especially between 2015 and 2019, where the three games made 'solo' by Ghost Games all flopped. 2022's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/need-for-speed-unbound/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Need for Speed Unbound</a> was co-developed by Criterion Games and Codemasters and fared much better, but still didn't produce good enough sales to warrant a sequel, it seems. </p>



<p>Last we heard, in September 2023, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/criterion-games-added-to-ea-entertainment-to-work-on-next-battlefield-and-new-need-for-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> Criterion Games to the EA Entertainment group so that they could work on the next Battlefield as well as a new entry in the racing game franchise. It's possible that the project wasn't coming along well, or perhaps EA simply decided that they should focus solely on Battlefield 6, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they are helping with both single player and multiplayer content</a>.</p>



<p>After all, Need for Speed doesn't really compare with Battlefield in terms of relevance to Electronic Arts; to give you an idea, the publisher is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently hoping to reach 100 million players for Battlefield 6</a> somehow. A lofty task, but not completely impossible should the game turn out to be a massive success, whereas racing games are way more niche - even the most successful in recent years, Forza Horizon 5, 'only' reached 45 million so far, and that's counting Game Pass players as well.</p>



<p>In other Need for Speed news, EA has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-endings-need-for-speed-rivals-online-support-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Rivals, the 2013 game co-developed by Criterion and Ghost, will end its online support on October 7, 2025.</p>
