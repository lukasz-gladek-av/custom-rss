			<p>A Monster Hunter Wilds mod called Tex Decompressor Tool is now available for download, significantly improving stuttering issues on a good number of system configurations.</p>
<p>The tool, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/951?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and is fully compatible with the game's latest version, is used to create a patch pak with uncompressed textures, which can improve frame rate stability but will take up more disk space with both the regular textures and the ones included in the High Resolution texture pack. The process can be somewhat complicated, but Nexus Mods member <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/users/134767873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mox9291</a> provided a handy tutorial in the mod's comment section on how to use the tool and enjoy the more stable performance granted by the removal of the decompression step that can cause stuttering issues even on powerful systems.</p>
<p>As I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a> earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds is one of the best entries in the series, so much so that it's easy to look past some of its shortcomings. While the performance issues still have to be addressed, CAPCOM has started providing more challenging hunts this month with the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/">Title Update</a>, which introduced returning monster Mizustune and its Tempered variant as well as the high rank variant of campaign final boss Zoh Shia. Another challenging monster, Arch tempered Rey Dau, will be made available later this month, though PC hunters can use some <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mods-custom-quests-new-monster/">mods</a> to take on the new variant of the Apex predator right now.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The 8 nm chip powering the Nintendo Switch 2 may be a disappointing choice for some, but there's the chance that it has been chosen to allow the easy creation of upgraded system revisions based on node shrinks.</p>
<p>Speaking during their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> commented on the system's Samsung 8 nm chip, suggesting that it may have been picked not only for economic reasons, as Nintendo likely got a deal on a production line that is no longer producing that many chips, but also to keep the door open for hardware revisions based on node shrinks. A future console revision on a 5 nm class node, which also includes a 4 nm node, could do wonders for battery life, which leaves something to be desired in the launch system, as it is estimated to be 2 hours at minimum, half an hour less than the battery life of the launch original Switch model. A node shrink would also open the way for a portable-only Nintendo Switch 2 Lite, as battery life in such a system would be extremely important to make it an enticing purchase. Considering Nintendo would want to bundle all of its&nbsp;key tech improvements together, an OLED model will likely also follow with a node shrink.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch 2 Mid-Gen Refresh Potential: Are New OLED and Lite Models Possible?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nc0ieceoQKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Nintendo has always released hardware revisions for almost every one of its systems with only a few notable exceptions, there's little doubt that Nintendo Switch 2 revisions will be made at some point, so it will be very interesting to see if Digital Foundry's speculation ends up aligning with Nintendo's plans. For the time being, however, those who wish to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, besides other exclusives, have no choice but to purchase the only console model that is launching on<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/"> June 5th.</a></p>

			<p>While the rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster has finally been proven to be real, it will take some time to learn more about the Fallout 3 remaster that was revealed at the same time as the soon-to-be-released remaster.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remaster of the third entry in the series, which was revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing</a> besides the Oblivion remaster, saying that it will be a while before we see it, without providing any additional information. If Microsoft and Bethesda stick to the timeframes detailed back in 2023, we should be seeing more of the Fallout 3 remaster in around two years or so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It'll be a while before we see it.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1912227284511273452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As already mentioned, the existence of a Fallout 3 remaster is essentially a given at this point, with the confirmation that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is real and possibly coming very soon. Following weeks of rumors and speculation, the first few screenshots of the remaster leaked online <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">yesterday</a> via the official website of the developer who was long rumored to be working on it, Virtuos. Unfortunately, we still don't know if the remaster will sport gameplay improvements besides the visual upgrade powered by Unreal Engine 5, but thankfully it won't be long to see if and how the experience will have been improved, as the remaster is said to be released next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Later this year, we'll also get the fan-made Oblivion-to-Skyrim port called Skyblivion, and the team lead has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the official remaster.</p>

			<p>Here at Wccftech, we have followed the long development of the Skyblivion project for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over eight years</a>. For nearly a decade, an ambitious team of modders has strived to recreate The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Ever since early 2023, we have known that the team was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeting 2025</a> as their tentative release window for the total conversion mod. Later that year, though, the infamous FTC vs. Microsoft trial leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda had plans to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 one, interestingly).</p>
<p>I was already in touch with Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-remix-qa-with-skyblivion-lead-dev-hopes-dreams-and-worries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having interviewed him</a> in late 2022 about the modding and remastering potential of NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform. Needless to say, I immediately reached out again to gauge his reaction to that leak. Back then, though, he didn't really buy that it was true. I pointed out those were official documents, so the project might have been canceled or delayed, but it was surely in existence at some point.</p>
<p>For a while, it&nbsp;<span>seemed like the Oblivion remaster might have been canceled. Throughout 2024, there were no further leaks or rumors. Everything changed in 2025, though, as the first concrete leaks appeared,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a>&nbsp;that Virtuos had worked on it using Unreal Engine 5. Over the last few weeks, insiders have begun&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a> that Microsoft could be planning a shadow drop—a game announcement and release at the same time—</span>at some point in April.</p>
<p>At last, visual evidence of Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">materialized yesterday</a> when fellow Internet sleuths found the game's first screenshots on the developer's website. Just a couple of hours later, Skyblivion lead Rebelzize <a href="https://x.com/rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140?s=46&amp;t=iYm9jOtB1G3D9hHCMqQ8dw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared a brief comment on X</a>, having dealt with the fact that it was all real:</p>
<p><em>The real remake is the friends we made along the way.</em></p>
<p><em><span>To be clear, this changes nothing for me. This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community, it is a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year.</span><span> All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster.</span></em></p>
<p><iframe title="SKYBLIVION Live Development Stream[LIKING THE STREAM IS APPRECIATED]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-ZsA-zHUJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Later yesterday, I spoke briefly with him to get an expanded reaction:</p>
<p><em>It looks like a cool take on it and totally different than what my vision was. Looking forward to trying it myself. Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>For what it's worth, I think there's definitely space for both Skyblivion and Oblivion Remastered. The former might not be as visually impressive (although I'm sure at least some of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Skyrim graphics features</a> can be ported to it), but it will feature both cut content and new content, as well as other gameplay changes. From what we know of the official remaster based on the leaks, there should be some gameplay changes to make it more modern, but no restored or new content. As Rebelzize put it, users can choose between two versions of Oblivion, and that can only be a good thing. By the way, I've also asked him whether the plan is still to launch in 2025, and the answer was yes.</p>

			<p>A couple of weeks ago, Jagex <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-is-a-co-op-open-world-survival-crafting-game-due-soon-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> RuneScape: Dragonwilds, an open world survival crafting game set in its beloved fantasy universe. The UK developer said back then that the Steam Early Access launch would launch sometime in Spring but did not provide a specific date. It was, therefore, surprising to see the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become available without any further announcements on Valve's store</a> a few hours ago, priced at £24.99 GBP / $29.99 / €29.99.</p>
<p>Jesse America, Executive Producer of this game, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We’re so excited to surprise players with our Early Access launch today and invite them to discover the magical world of RuneScape: Dragonwilds right now. We’ve been working hard to develop an entirely new type of RuneScape experience that ignites fans’ passion, creativity and love for questing, and provide them with an all-new RuneScape adventure to discover. And this is just the start of our development journey. Throughout Early Access, we’ll be updating the game regularly with new content and features, while listening closely to the community to deliver an iconic open world survival crafting game that is loved equally by our biggest RuneScape fans and new players alike. Our community is at the heart of everything we do at Jagex and we look forward to seeing how they shape RuneScape: Dragonwilds throughout our Early Access journey.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="RuneScape: Dragonwilds | Official Narrative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnPPTCHNqzw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, early user reception seems quite positive. The average user review score is 79% for the time being. Jagex also outlined the Early Access roadmap. There will be constant improvements to the following areas: combat, performance, multiplayer, difficulty, lighting, weather, messaging, and tutorials. New magic, ranged, and farming skills will be introduced, as well as new quests, gear, lore, music, animals, and a new enemy type, the lesser dragons. Moreover, the base building mechanics will be expanded, and the Hardcore and Creative modes will be added. Last but not least, a whole new region called Fellhollow will be introduced.</p>
<p>This zone is said to be suspended between life and death. A twisted dragon called Imaru is its overlord, and various undead enemies will populate Fellhollow. Players will be guided here by Death, a well-known character to RuneScape fans.</p>

			<p>As we get closer to the game's launch date, publisher 505 Games and developer MercurySteam are posting regular new Blades of Fire trailers focused on different areas of the single player action/adventure title. The latest one dives into combat, which is a major part of the game.</p>
<p><em>Weapons are split into three categories: slashing, piercing, and blunt types, with some weapons having the option of swapping between both slashing and piercing. To ensure you're using the</em><br>
<em>right weapon for the job, check the enemy's outline for their weak points and cycle through your equipped weapons. Fighting with the right weapon and targeting an enemy's weak points ensures that you'll make quick work of all those you come up against.</em></p>
<p><em>Make use of the terrain by sticking to the higher ground to gain the advantage in battle. Adso is also here to assist. He will analyze and document every enemy you encounter, recording all the details in his chronicle. The more you face each enemy type, the more detailed Adso's notes will become, revealing their lore and better strategies to defeat them. Defeating a certain number of enemies wielding the same weapon will unlock that weapon's forging scroll. Once the scroll is collected, the new weapon will be ready for you to forge, thus further improving your arsenal.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - Getting Started - Episode 3 - Combat [ESRB M]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuCENttWDb0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At GDC 2025, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with Blades of Fire</a> and came away with a positive first impression of the game:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies.</em></p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X starting May 22. You can read the full system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
