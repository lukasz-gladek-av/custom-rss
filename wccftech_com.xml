			<p>A Sonic Adventure 2 Unreal Engine 5 remake is in the works, and a new playable demo is now available for download to allow users to experience for themselves the stunning recreation of some classic stages.</p>
<p>The demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/SA2R/939490">here</a>, features the modern recreation of Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Green Forest, among other levels and boss fight updates. The demo, much like the yet-to-be-released full remake, is powered by the Azure Framework, a branch of Velocity+ that overhauls the physics, camera, controls, and UI to offer a brand-new experience that still sports some classic mechanics, such as a high-speed platforming experience and the return of the scoring system which rewards players to chain moves together to keep a perfect score and score more points. Visuals have also been significantly improved over the original, featuring real-time path-traced lighting and reflections.</p>

<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog PC fans have definitely been eating well. Besides the recent release of the Sonic Adventure 2 Redux Unreal Engine 5 remake demo, some dedicated developers have released an unofficial port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-unleashed-unofficial-pc-port-download/">Sonic Unleashed</a>, finally giving PC players the chance to try out the console-exclusive game like never before. Hopefully, the follow-up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/">Sonic Frontiers</a>, which has yet to be officially announced, will receive the same amount of love from Sonic Team as these fan projects have from their developers.</p>

			<p>The Xbox handheld known as Project Keenan was teased with a not-subtle-at-all video that essentially confirmed who is making the yet-to-be-officially-announced system.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the ASUS ROG Global official X profile shared a new video teasing something new that the company is working on. During the video, an ROG Ally is shown together with an Xbox controller, strongly hinting at the fact that ASUS is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">indeed</a> the company making the Xbox handheld reportedly launching this year. The Xbox X profile also added more fuel to the fire by reacting with a rather telling meme, so it seems like it's all but confirmed that ASUS is making the handheld.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://t.co/ONZpeEmNka">pic.twitter.com/ONZpeEmNka</a></p>
<p>— Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Xbox handheld codenamed Project Keenan, which will look markedly Xbox with a similar design sensibility and will run full Windows with the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass as some of its focuses, is only a small part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">Microsoft next-generation plans</a>, which will also include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a full-blown handheld that will launch in 2027. Microsoft's next-generation system will supposedly deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical leap</a> ever seen, so it will be very interesting to learn how this leap will be delivered and how future games will take advantage of it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new rumor suggests that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake could be mere days from its announcement and launch. New leaker Detective Seeds <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1906165593016799478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> (two days ago, so it's not an April Fools' joke) that the launch could come as soon as Thursday, April 3, or maybe next week, according to his source. Detective Seeds doesn't have a long track record, but he did get a couple of things right: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-out-on-april-17-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 release date of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM previews dropped yesterday</a>. He also <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1906086027665490373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that Ghost of Yotei might launch in July, by the way. We'll see if he's right about either of them.</p>
<p>As for the Oblivion remake, though, there are other sources pointing in that direction. Both proven insider NatetheHate and VideoGamesChronicle <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-unreal-engine-5-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-and-launched-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game would launch in April, with the former also adding that it could be shadow-dropped, meaning the announcement and launch would happen at the same time. It would, however, be a little surprising since Xbox has South of Midnight (out next week) and then the aforementioned PS5 debut of the Indiana Jones game.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake is said to be powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology and developed by Virtuos. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous report from MP1st,</a> the remake will deliver enhancements in six main gameplay areas (other than the obvious visuals): Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD.</p>
<p>Blocking has reportedly been inspired by the Soulslike genre and other modern action games. Sneak has also been overhauled and its damage formula has been reworked. The stamina system was tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen when you ran out of stamina should occur less often.</p>
<p>The HUD (Heads-Up Display) has been modified to make it more accessible and visually interesting. In combat, hit reactions have been introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, Virtuos has improved archery so that it feels smoother whether the user is playing with the third or first person camera.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake comes in the same year as <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyblivion</a>, the long-awaited fan-made total conversion of The Elder Scrolls IV into the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. There should be enough adventures in Cyrodiil for everyone in 2025.</p>
