			<p>Today, Polish independent developer Questline has announced the full release date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</a>.</p>
<p>Questline previously launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1199030/Tainted_Grail_Conquest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainted Grail: Conquest</a>, a hybrid game mixing deck-building roguelike elements with RPG, in 2021 to positive reviews.&nbsp;This one is much more ambitious, though. It's a first-person open world roleplaying game available on Steam Early Access for two years, now set to debut version 1.0 for PC and consoles (<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-demo/9nql6tbgt1gc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>) on May 23.</p>
<p>The developers are promising a meaty experience that can take between 50 and 70 hours to be completed. Players will find the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three massive zones to explore:</strong>&nbsp;Horns of the South, Cuanacht, and Forlorn Swords.</li>
<li><strong>250 unique NPCs</strong>, fully voice-acted, adding depth and a personal touch to the world.</li>
<li><strong>Over 200 side quests</strong>, ensuring countless hours of engaging gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>More than 60 unique enemies</strong>, each presenting distinct challenges.</li>
<li><strong>70+ dungeons</strong>&nbsp;filled with secrets and dangers.</li>
<li><strong>A branching main quest</strong>&nbsp;with dozens of possible endings, offering deep replayability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting-wise, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is a dark fantasy reimagining of Arthurian legends. Players will journey into the heart of Avalon, a land shaped by 600 years of Camelot’s rule, to witness the epic conclusion of this era. With their choices, they will decide the legacy of King Arthur's reign.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 will introduce the community-requested third-person view. Questline has prefaced that it won't be perfect yet, but they're adding it in anyway since many users have problems with the first-person view (such as motion sickness). At this stage, it's more of an accessibility fix. Of course, there will also be brand new Achievements to mark the players' journey throughout Avalon.</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, as the developers of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon hinted that version 1.0 includes so much content that it's 'crazy' and they would have 'laughed hard' if they were told the game would end up this big. However, the full patch notes aren't available yet.</p>
<p>As a side note, the team also shared a 'golden horse armor DLC' joke as a joke reference to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion Remastered</a>, then added in a Steam post:</p>
<p><em>On a serious note, it is so good to see Oblivion coming back with such a style! It is one of the games that shaped us when we were kids/teens, and continues to be a huge source of inspiration. BIG congratulations to the team responsible for the remaster! We can’t wait to get back to Cyrodiil ourselves, but for now… well, we have a game to finish first! And we are honestly doing our best to deliver something unique that we hope you will remember for quite a long time.</em></p>

			<p>Sydney Sweeney is appearing in the news for video game to film adaptations for the second time this week. After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">report from Deadline</a> that Sweeney would be teaming up with Michael Bay to adapt SEGA's Out Run into a movie, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/">Variety</a> reports that Sweeney is now teaming up with Wicked director Jon M. Chu to adapt Hazelight's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split-Fiction</a> into a film.</p>
<p>Sweeney is slated to be an executive producer and will also star in the movie. Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the same writers behind Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, will write the script.</p>
<p>Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">previously</a> reported that a Split-Fiction movie was happening, but now we know some of the key creatives behind the project. While Sweeney will play one of the lead roles between Zoe and Mio, characters named after Hazelight Studio head Josef Fares' daughters, it's not yet decided which role Sweeney will play.</p>
<p>In the case of a game like Out Run, it isn't easy to see what shape a film adaptation of that game will take. The opposite is true for Split-Fiction, which, despite having a predictable story, is ripe for a film adaptation with plenty of opportunities for big blockbuster movie moments in its fantasy and sci-fi settings.</p>
<p>The next big questions now are who will star alongside Sweeney, how Chu will bring some of the magic he brought to Wicked to Split Fiction, and whether the story can't be punched up in a new medium with its film version.</p>
<p>So far, in the renaissance of video game adaptations to movie or TV show adaptations, we've not seen an adaptation surpass the game in terms of storytelling. Some changes have been praised, but there hasn't yet been an adaptation where we could definitively say the story is improved in the adapted version. Split-Fiction feels like the perfect candidate to break that ceiling.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-next-skate-game-wont-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-multiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-skate-game-won%E2%80%99t-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-%E2%80%9Cmultiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox%E2%80%9D.1173906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-next-skate-game-wont-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-multiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Players have asked EA for years to bring back the Skate series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-announced/">four years ago</a>, EA finally answered those prayers with the official confirmation that the skateboarding series would indeed be coming back.</p>
<p>Four years later, we know that was just an announcement at the time and that this new Skate game was only beginning its development when EA confirmed the series' return. But now that we're <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">approaching its early access</a> release sometime this year, we're learning more about it, and the latest bit of confirmed news is one that definitely won't go down well with fans.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">Eurogamer</a>, developer Full Circle confirmed that the new Skate game will not have an offline mode. You'll always need to be online and connected to the game's servers when playing. In an FAQ section towards the bottom of a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">new blog</a> from Full Circle, the studio bluntly answered the question about an offline mode.</p>
<p>"<em>The simple answer: No. The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You'll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection.</em>"</p>
<p>It's disappointing news for veteran fans of the series, many of whom likely don't want to be bothered with the live service elements of the new Skate game. They were just looking to spend hours enjoying the skateboarding mechanics and feeling that only the Skate series provided back when the original trilogy was in its heyday.</p>
<p>While this new Skate game will launch in early access later this year, Full Circle also confirmed that more than 200,000 players have already gotten the chance to check it out in the game's closed alpha test that's been running since September 2024. If you want to join that number, you can still sign up for the playtest and hope to be selected. There's also always the hope that Full Circle will run an open beta ahead of the early access release closer to the launch.</p>
