			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally is launching in a few months, but Microsoft reportedly has yet to commit to a price due to the uncertainty of the current economic situation.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/so-just-how-much-will-the-xbox-ally-cost-heres-what-we-know-so-far">Windows Central</a> corroborated the rumored October launch window for the two handhelds, clarifying they are tentatively slated for late October. According to the outlet's sources, however, the rumored prices of $499 for the base model and $799 for the premium model may not be accurate, as Microsoft has yet to commit to a price due to the tariffs imposed by the United States on products manufactured in countries such as China and Taiwan, where ASUS manufactures its products.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X were revealed earlier this month during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, following a few teases shared in the past few months. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which will deliver higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither model, however, will feature a superior<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/"> OLED display</a>, as ASUS had to balance adding the nowadays essential VRR support with power draw and costs, deeming an LCD panel an ultimately better choice.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally handhelds will launch before the end of the year worldwide.</p>
