			<p>While Unreal Engine 5's Lumen and Nanite redefined modern visuals, the engine makes more than a few gamers shudder in fear due to its heavy system requirements and its widely known <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-pc-performance-benchmarks/">performance and stuttering issues</a></strong>, which prevent many from enjoying games powered by the engine properly, especially on PC.</p>



<p>Since the engine's launch, however, Epic has attempted to mitigate these issues, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/"><strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong></a> seems to be yet another step in the right direction.</p>



<p>A new comparison video put together by MxBenchmarkPC highlights the performance improvements introduced in the latest version of the engine by running the Unreal Engine 5.4 and Unreal Engine 5.7 versions of the <a href="https://scansfactory.gumroad.com/l/DEMO-Venice"><strong>Photorealistic Venice Tech Demo created by Scans Factory</strong></a> running side-by-side.</p>



<p>In terms of performance on an RTX 5080 GPU, <em>"GPU performance is improved by up to 25% in UE 5.7 (depending on a scene), and the 5.7 version is now better utilizing GPU resources, hence the GPU power draw is now higher," </em>writes the YouTuber. </p>



<p>CPU performance on an Intel Core i7-14700F is significantly improved, up to 35%, which leads, according to MxBenchmarkPC, to <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">"more stable frametimes with less hitches across all scenes."</em> This last improvement is particularly welcome, as the biggest issue in most games powered by Unreal Engine 5 is unstable frametimes that lead to a choppy and very unpleasant experience.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.7 also brings some image quality improvements, as MxBenchmarkPC highlighted in their analysis. <em>"In terms of image quality, UE 5.7 offers more stable and accurate Lumen lighting, and especially higher quality Lumen reflections (with better performance at the same time)."</em> Unfortunately, Lumen denoising quality has only been improved slightly, so tech like NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction still does a better job than the engine's native solution.</p>

<p>While it will be a while to see games built to take advantage of the enhancements introduced in Unreal Engine 5.7, the fact that Epic continues to address some of the engine's most critical flaws is encouraging, and bodes well for the future. Hopefully, it won't take too long to finally see Unreal Engine 5 games running smoothly even on mid-range PC hardware.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AdHoc Studio’s Dispatch Will Arrive On Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 Next Month, According to AU Store Listing]]></title>

			<p>Dispatch, the interactive narrative from former Telltale developers at AdHoc Studio that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">secured a nomination at The Game Awards</a> despite releasing its final episode only five days before the nominations were announced, appears to be coming to the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 next month on January 29, 2026.</p>



<p>At least that's according to <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332">a store listing on the Australian eShop</a> listing that was spotted online. There's been no official word from AdHoc Studio through its social media channels or its website acknowledging the new release, but an official store listing is, at the very least, a strong sign that Dispatch will be available on Nintendo's hybrid consoles in the new year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even though Dispatch didn't arrive until later in the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">with its first batch of episodes releasing on October 22</a>, followed by the rest of the episodes releasing weekly up until November 12, it still made a significant impact on the year in the eyes of players. Featuring Aaron Paul as the lead, supported by actors like Jeffery Wright and Laura Baily, along with other voice actors players know from other games and from Critical Role, Dispatch is easily one of the year's most successful indie titles.</p>



<p>Not only has it <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-closing-in-on-7m-copies-sold/">continued its strong sales since launch</a> and since the release of its finale episode for Season 1, according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/novembers-best-selling-steam-games">Alinea Analytics</a>, it was also one of the best-selling games on Steam for November 2025.</p>







<p>Currently, AdHoc Studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dispatch-season-2-cant-take-gta-6-amounts-of-time-fret-adhoc-as-they-decide-whether-or-not-to-make-it">is still weighing up whether it'll make a Season 2</a>, though that appears to be highly likely based on the reception the first season received and the success the game has had so far. It might be the case that we'll get a Season 2 after Dispatch has made it to all major platforms, since it is currently only available on PC and PS5. Once it arrives on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 next month, and Xbox sometime later, then we might finally get confirmation of Season 2, if AdHoc decides to make it.</p>
