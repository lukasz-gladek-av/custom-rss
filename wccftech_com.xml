			<p>The latest version of the ShadPS4 emulator continues to improve Bloodborne's performance on PC, fixing a critical issue and more.</p>
<p>As showcased by GAMESMARK in a new video, version 0.4.1 of the emulator, which is not yet available to the public, runs the game with full audio and no longer requires a mod workaround to work properly. Performance seems to be extremely solid as well, as the game runs at 4K resolution and around 100 FPS on a system powered by an AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, an RTX 4070 GPU, and 32 GB of DDR5 RAM.</p>

<p>The latest public version of the ShadPS4 emulator, which is finally making it possible to enjoy Bloodborne on PC after it has been stuck on PlayStation 4 since its release, was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-version-0-4-0-download/">last week.</a> The 0.4.0 version of the emulator packs tons of improvements and fixes, including shader recompiler fixes, emulated support for CPUs that don't have SSE4.2a, an auto-update feature, swap chain recreation and window resizing, improved keyboard navigation in the game list, working touchpad support, multiple install folders, improved Vulkan support and more. This version of the emulator also runs Gravity Rush Remastered, another game that is not currently available on PC, without any workaround.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-end-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is unlikely to be revealed before the end of the year, as the official announcement of the system during a critical season could significantly impact the company.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/">Reuters</a>, Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda commented on the yet-to-be-revealed system, saying that making an announcement before the end of the year has gotten quite difficult, as Nintendo would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical end-of-year shopping season.</p>
<p>Given how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/">last quarter has been pretty underwhelming for Nintendo</a>, the statement from Yasuda-san makes quite a lot of sense, as the Japanese company will want a much better quarter to close out the fiscal year before going all-in with the Nintendo Switch 2. A reveal in the first few months of 2025 also suggests that the console will indeed not launch anytime before April 2025, something that was also suggested by a report from August, which revealed that multiple developers were told not to expect the console to launch in early 2025.</p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 other than that it has been in the works for a while. According to leaks, the console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">shouldn't look too different</a> from its predecessor and should support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/">NVIDIA DLSS</a> and Ray Reconstruction, which would let it deliver solid performance and possibly better ray tracing than other current-generation systems.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-gets-free-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-gets-free-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod.1027698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-gets-free-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a year and a half since PureDark <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-elden-ring-is-out-now-delivering-substantial-performance-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> his Elden Ring NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation mod. The paid mod allowed GeForce RTX 40 Series owners a significant performance boost in the notoriously badly optimized game developed by FromSoftware.</p>
<p>However, everyone else without an RTX 40 Series GPU has been out of luck so far. That changes with the recently released free <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/6794?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR Frame Generation and Temporal Super Resolution (ERSS-FG) mod</a> by Nexus Mods user huutaiii.</p>
<p>This mod supports AMD FSR 3 Super Resolution and Frame Generation, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA, and even Intel XeSS. The modder shared a few caveats: this is mutually exclusive with their previous ERSS2 mod (which did not support Frame Generation); the Frame Generation feature is not compatible with ReShade; and, most importantly, you can't play online on official servers with this mod enabled.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Here's the recommended installation method for this Elden Ring AMD FSR 3 mod:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Extract the attached file's content into the ELDEN RING\Game\ directory (including ERSS-FG.dll, dxgi.dll and the folder ERSS2; the file ERSSReShadeStub.addon can be removed).</em></li>
<li><em>Disable Easy Anti-Cheat, either by putting cmd /c start eldenring.exe &amp; rem %command% in launch options in Steam or by using some other tool.</em></li>
<li><em>For Steam Deck (Linux) users: cmd=(%command%); cmd[-1]="eldenring.exe"; WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b;dxgi=n,b" "${cmd[@]}"</em></li>
<li><em>Set Resolution in the game's Graphics menu to <span>.</span>r target resolution (i.e. your monitor's resolution)</em></li>
<li><em>Open the mod's configuration overlay with the Home key, set Frame Generation method to AMD FSR then restart, and set Super Sampling setting to the upscaling technology of your choice</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several known issues with the current release of this Elden Ring AMD FSR 3 mod, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Flickering global illumination, most visible in shaded areas</em><br>
<em><strong>Workarounds</strong>:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Restarting the game may make it go away temporarily</em></li>
<li><em>Using the GI Glitch Mitigation options in Advanced Settings -&gt; Frame Generation (which may reduce frame rate slightly depending on which option you select)</em></li>
<li><em>Rolling back NVIDIA GPU drivers to version 552.12</em></li>
<li><em>Using DXVK + VKD3D (doesn't support DLSS on Windows)</em></li>
<li><em>Setting Global Illumination to Low can reduce the intensity</em></li>
<li><em>Some reported that turning on Ray tracing can make the issue go away.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Game UI color is slightly off &amp; requires manual configuration in HDR</em></li>
<li><em>There may be some glitches on non-16:9 resolutions outside of the main 16:9 screen area</em></li>
<li><em>Conflicts with other overlay mods (using standalone installation method)</em></li>
<li><em>Cannot be loaded by adding to Special K plug-ins. It can run alongside SK with the included DXGI.dll loader albeit with some issues</em></li>
<li><em>FSR FG + Special K: if Elden Ring's screen mode is set to Full-screen, the game will constantly try to reset it's output swap chain causing flashes</em></li>
<li><em>The Special K overlay is invisible</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Even with these caveats and issues, this might still be useful for those who have been waiting for the right time to dive back into Elden Ring and play the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-witnesses-52-of-total-us-xbox-players-checking-it-out-a-new-record/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has witnessed a fantastic launch, probably the franchise's most successful entry, as it captured the attention of over half of the US Xbox Series S/X players.</p>
<p>Well, it won't be wrong to say that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has managed to put behind all the woes we had with Activision and partners in terms of their take on the franchise since the newest entry has managed to break all previous records, in terms of the anticipation and hype. During Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-fy25-q1-total-gaming-revenue-up-by-43-all-from-activision/">recent earnings call</a>, CEO Satya Nadella verified that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/">established new franchise records</a> and has been described as the "biggest" release of the Call of Duty series.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis by Circana CEO and analyst Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7suuurekr2l">via Bluesky</a>), it is now revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has managed to grasp the attention of "one out of every two Xbox Series S/X players," which is indeed a massive achievement for the franchise, given that the Game Pass inclusion has surely worked out for Activision and partners.</p>
<p><em>According to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, on Oct 23rd, 19% of US active Xbox Series players and 18% of US active PlayStation 5 players launched Call of Duty HQ. </em></p>
<p><em>On October 28th, 52% of active XBS players and 34% of active PS5 players did so. Both were all-time highs for Call of Duty HQ.</em></p>
<p>Despite Xbox users having an edge with Game Pass access, PlayStation users weren't left behind at all in the hype, as one-third of the active PS5 consumer base were involved in checking the title out, showing that Activision is getting love from all gaming platforms. Not just the US, but the title did manage to draw the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/">largest traffic ever for a game in the UK</a>, and while we haven't seen any metrics surface, the indicators clearly show that the cumulative player count is going to be a phenomenal one.</p>
<p>It is surely exciting to see the Call of Duty franchise making a massive comeback, and the Xbox-Activision partnership has definitely catalyzed the increase in player count due to the ease of accessing the title through Game Pass.</p>

			<p>Here's something we weren't expecting: Age of Empires II Definitive Edition might be about to launch on PlayStation consoles. The rumor comes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1gibltj/aoe2_joins_ps_confirmed_or_graphics_bug/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the franchise's subreddit</a>, where someone spotted players supposedly joining a multiplayer match from Sony's platform, possibly while testing the port. Truth to be told, The Verge's Tom Warren did hint it could happen in a newsletter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted </a>a few months ago:</p>
<p><em>As part of Project Latitude, Microsoft has also been considering launching Age of Empires II Definitive Edition on rival consoles in early 2025, and its upcoming remastered spinoff, Age of Mythology: Retold, could come, too.</em></p>
<p>Age of Mythology: Retold <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> two months ago, earning an 8/10 score from Wccftech's Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Age of Mythology Retold brings back a classic with new - great - visuals, a new UI, and a few new gameplay features. While it does, for the most part, feel more like a remaster, there's still an incredible amount to love here, and the few new features the army of developers have added bring a whole new level to the game.</em></p>
<p>Age of Empires II Definitive Edition is much older, though, having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> nearly five years ago. Granted, developer Forgotten Empires has continuously provided great support for it, releasing six expansion packs (Lords of the West, Dawn of the Dukes, Dynasties of India, Return of Rome, The Mountain Royals, Victors and Vanquished) while a seventh called Chronicles: Battle for Greece will launch on November 14.</p>
<p>It's also the remaster of the most acclaimed game in what is arguably Microsoft's longest-standing franchise (except for Flight Simulator). In that regard, it would be peculiar to see it on the rival platform, though Microsoft has long <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shifted</a> its strategy when it comes to exclusive games. In fact, more Xbox and PC exclusives are expected to launch on PlayStation 5 in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter.1027638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-cuts-yearly-forecast-after-another-weak-switch-quarter/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Nintendo reported its latest quarterly financial results to investors. The previous trend of weak Switch sales has continued: the hybrid handheld/home console sold only 2.62 million units this quarter, for a lifetime total of 146.04 million units as of September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The quarterly Switch sales decreased by 10.58% year-over-year. A similar result was seen regarding quarterly software sales (39.6 million units), which dropped by 10.66% compared to last year's quarter. Out of the new games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> has sold 2.58 million units, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake</a> sold 1.94 million, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> reached 1.57 million.</p>
<p>In this underwhelming quarter, Nintendo's operating profit went down by 29.07% year-over-year. Moreover, the company cut its forecast for the full fiscal year from 13.5 million Switch units to 12.5 million units:</p>
<p><em>Although Nintendo Switch hardware and software unit sales through the first half of the fiscal year were both below our initial expectations, many people continue to play with Nintendo Switch even in its eighth year since launch. For hardware, by continuing to convey the appeal of the Switch, we try to not only put one system in every home, but several in every home, or even one for every person.</em></p>
<p><em>Another objective is to continually release new offerings so more consumers keep playing Switch even longer and we can maximize hardware sales. For software, in addition to Super Mario Party Jamboree, released in October, we have other titles planned for release, such as Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership (November) and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (January 2025). Other software publishers plan to release a wide variety of titles, and we will</em><br>
strive to invigorate the platform by continually introducing new titles in addition to the existing titles.</p>
<p><em>We have modified the Nintendo Switch hardware and software sales unit forecasts for the fiscal year in consideration of the sales trend through the six months ended September 30, 2024.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, analysts weren't exactly thrilled with the Japanese corporation's performance. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-05/nintendo-sees-bigger-profit-decline-on-faltering-switch-demand?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Bloomberg</a>, Toyo Securities's Hideki Yasuda said:</p>
<p><em>The Switch is at the end of its shelf life, and even software sales are weak. If this trend continues, the Switch’s momentum will drop even further.</em></p>
<p>Serkan Toto of Kantan Games added:</p>
<p><em>Nintendo overestimated the appeal of their 2024 software pipeline, which has no real blockbusters but several filler games. Looking at the software still coming out this fiscal year, I believe the adjusted hardware and software sales forecast is still too high.</em></p>
<p>None of this is surprising, as the whole industry and market are waiting for the announcement of the Switch 2. However, Nintendo seems content not to hurry.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission.1027611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much of the Slitterhead gameplay revolves around Rarities, gifted humans who can achieve higher attunement with the mysterious Night Owl and maintain their consciousness while being possessed, which allows them to use some unique fighting styles and skills that can make your life easier against all sorts of opponents.</p>
<p>Unlock new Rarities is also a necessity to proceed in the main campaign, as you will need the help of specific characters to continue Night Owl's war against Slitterheads. The first time this happens is right after starting to investigate a religious cult that seems to be bringing together monsters and humans, and you will need Edo's help to proceed in this investigation.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241031011038_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you are notified of needing a new Rarity to proceed through the story, play the Parasite Mission 2nd round mission again. At the start of the mission, proceed normally until you reach the main street. Walk around until you hear two NPCs talking about a stray dog and a homeless man. Continue past these two characters, and you will find the stray dog, who is the same one you have met at the very start of the game. Possess it, follow the scent like you did at the beginning of the game, and you will eventually reach the homeless man named Edo. Possess the character, defeat the Slitterhead, and he will join Night Owl in his quest. Quit the mission, and the Hidden Cave RE 2nd Loop mission will be unlocked.</p>
<p>Besides being required to proceed through the story, Edo is an extremely strong Rarity to use if you enjoy fighting Slitterheads head-on, as he is a close-range fighter that can dish quite a bit of damage, deflect attacks automatically, perform a quick dodging maneuver, and increase attack power with his skills. He may not be a looker, but he sure knows how to deal with enemies!</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-qa-with-keiichiro-toyama-discussing-gameplay-mechanics-old-gen-release-and-silent-hill-series-revival/">Slitterhead</a>, Hyoki and his Rarities will have to fight a variety of enemies of the supernatural kind, but there will be times when regular old humans will get in their way, leaving them no choice but to use their special powers to take them out and continue their hunt for the vicious Slitterheads. These humans, however, are very different from the Civilians that Hyoki can possess and will fight back with everything they got.</p>
<p>During the Oppressive Force mission, you will encounter members of the S.P.E.U., a military unit out to destroy not only Slitterheads but also Hyoki. Dealing with them is considerably different than dealing with the monstrosities you have fought before, and you will have to adapt to the situation and use completely different strategies.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031121432_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For starters, always make sure to take advantage of any cover you can find.&nbsp; If you're unsure where they are, just press the LB button to slow time and survey your immediate vicinities, possibly possessing any Civilian or Rarity placed near covers. The members of the S.P.E.U. tend to attack relentlessly, so if you're caught outside of cover, you will receive a lot of damage.</p>
<p>As for taking these enemies out, you can employ a variety of different strategies, which depend on the Rarities you have brought to the mission and the Passive Skills you have learned. A very effective strategy involves two of Alex's unique skills: Blood Well and Time Bomb. The first is used to draw together every character in a certain radius in a single point. At this point, possess one of the attracted Civilians, use the Time Bomb skill, and possess another character far from the one that activated the skill to watch them explode and damage everyone in their vicinity. If you bring Anita, you will have no lack of Civilians to blow up, thanks to her Devil's Scent skill. The War Cry skill also works quite well with this strategy, as this Civilian Skill attracts the attention of any nearby enemy.</p>

<p>If you want to make dealing with humans armed to the teeth in Slitterhead even easier, you should have one of your Rarities learn the Possession Rush passive skill. This skill, which is always active as long as a Rarity who has learned it is present, allows any possessed character, whether it's a Rarity or a Civilian, to unleash a powerful attack after being possessed by Hyoki as long as the enemy is in front of the camera. By hopping from one character to the next, you can easily deal with multiple enemies easily as long as you handle the camera properly. This is an excellent strategy to deal with S.P.E.U. members armed with shields. Possess an NPC located behind their backs, unleash the Possession Rush skill, and watch them fall dead.</p>
