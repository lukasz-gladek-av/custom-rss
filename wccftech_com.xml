			<p>Gearbox took over the main stage at PAX East 2025 today to focus on two of its games, Borderlands 4 and Risk of Rain 2. For the latter, a brand new expansion was announced, titled Alloyed Collective. For the former, members of the development team, including Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, took to the stage and answered a few questions from the community, but notably, Pitchford was unable to answer one pretty important question, one that he says Gearbox doesn't have an answer for yet.</p>
<p>Starting with Risk of Rain 2, the new expansion goes deeper into Petrichor V, with six new stages for players to dig into, and if you're playing with friends, only one of you needs to own the Alloyed Collective expansion for all of you to enjoy the new content.</p>
<p>The Alloyed Collective will add 15 new items for players to grab, seven new enemies to fight, and two new survivors to master. There's currently no release date, with the announcement trailer below simply stating that it is "<em>coming&nbsp;</em><em>soon.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Risk of Rain 2 | Alloyed Collective Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXaaA5yCXW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As far as new details about Borderlands 4, Pitchford was joined by Andrew Reiner, chief creative officer at Gearbox, April Johnson, associate narrative director at Gearbox, Nick Thurston, lead game designer, and Grant Kao, associate creative director.</p>
<p>After recapping the end of Borderlands 3, the Gearbox panel dug into community questions, starting with what's up with the rest of the Crimson Raiders, and according to Johnson, the answer is that they've all split up looking for Lilith across the galaxy. Johnson also confirmed that we'll be seeing more of them in Borderlands 4, but didn't dig much further into detail.</p>
<p>Johnson also talked about the antagonist in Borderlands 4, the Timekeeper, the events that kick off the story of Borderlands 4, and the chaos that the vault hunters find when they arrive on Kairos at the start of the game. The broad strokes of these narrative details were all things we learned during Gearbox's <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-state-of-play-deep-dives-into-gameplay-gear-movement-changes-and-more/">State of Play event for Borderlands 4 last week</a>, so with the added time afforded Johnson and the rest of the team at the panel, they went through the individual backstories of the four new vault hunters, Rafa, Vex, Harlowe, and Amon, the planet of Kairos.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gearbox Main Theater Show at PAX East 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mvsx1FzIKEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pitchford added that there are no load times when players are exploring Kairos, and said it is the "<em>biggest</em>" world that the team has made for players to explore in the entire Borderlands series.</p>
<p>Beyond revealing too many narrative details and spoiling too much of the game, the one notable question Pitchford didn't exactly answer was the question of how much Borderlands 4 will cost. Instead of being able to give a direct answer, Pitchford went into a long response as to what Gearbox and his own thinking is on the issue.</p>
<p>"<em>I'll tell you the truth, I don't know. And that is the truth,</em>" he began saying."<em>It's an interesting time, right? On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where the people that make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people that are price sensitive. So there's some folks that don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>There's other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing, and there's tariffs for the retail packaging. It's getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands has more than twice the development budget than Borderlands 3. More than twice. So the truth is I don't know what the price is going to be. I do know that we will be opening pre-orders soon, and that will be when the price is</em> <em>set</em>."<em><br>
</em></p>
<p>"...<em>We're going to have a price set soon. </em><em>It might be the new price that Nintendo and Microsoft have led with. It might be that we stay back. It’s going to be the people at the [Gearbox] publishing house that decide that...We’ll know soon. I think it’s going to be fine, whatever it ends up being. Borderlands 4 is [expletive] amazing. It’s worth it.</em>"</p>
<p>The question of pricing has been a big one for games since discussions around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> being priced at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNjv6cqZeNAxXapIkEHUobAoEQFnoECDwQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3L37WylpHEkWHXgJBm8zXw">$100</a> started to make the rounds. Now that Nintendo has broken the seal with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">$80 Mario Kart</a>, it's almost certain that GTA VI will cost at least $80. But it wouldn't be shocking to see Take-Two test the waters of an $80 game with Gearbox and Borderlands 4 hitting that same bar.</p>
<p>Earlier in the Q&amp;A session, Pitchford mentioned an event Gearbox will be hosting in June, so it could be that pre-orders will go live at the time of that event, which could very well be around the time of Summer Game Fest. If so, we won't have to wait very long at all to see where Gearbox ends up landing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/">Overwatch 2</a> team at Blizzard has just unionized, making it the second wall-to-wall union under Blizzard after the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">World of Warcraft team unionized in July 2024</a>.</p>
<p>It's the latest major step forward for unionization in the video game industry, as almost 200 developers at Activision Blizzard are members of the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA. They now join the ranks of <a href="https://code-cwa.org/news/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">One BGS USA</a>, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">One BGS Montreal</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers">ZeniMax Workers United</a>, <a href="https://x.com/WeAreGWA">Game Workers Alliance at Raven Software</a>, and the aforementioned WoWGG-CWA.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Nearly 200 game developers behind Activision Blizzard’s hit franchise Overwatch have joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA), becoming the latest group of video game workers at Microsoft-owned studios to form a wall-to-wall</span></em> <em>union</em>," a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">press release</a> from the CWA reads.</p>
<p>"<em>A neutral arbitrator confirmed today that an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal. The workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, Calif., and Microsoft has recognized the union.</em>"</p>
<p>While some of the above unions are department-specific, the WoWGG-CWA and the newly formed Overwatch 2 union spread across all departments, from artists to QA to game designers, level designers, etc. The OWGG-CWA will now join its fellow unions in negotiating their first contract, a process that the CWA previously accused <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/microsofts-bargaining-delays-leave-video-game-workers-without-union-contracts-two">Microsoft of dragging its feet on</a>.</p>
<p>Bargaining delays were one of the reasons the ZeniMax Workers United union members cited for overwhelmingly voting in favor of giving strike powers to their bargaining representatives. At the beginning of last month, the vote was announced, with 94% of members voting 'yes' to strike authorization. They have yet to announce if a strike will be called as negotiations continue.</p>
<p>In a report from <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">Kotaku</a>, Blizzard test analyst Simon Hedrick cited the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">mass layoffs</a> that started 2024 as to what drove him to seriously consider unionizing, and that "<em>u</em><em>p to that moment I’d been really happy in what I was doing.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>People were gone out of nowhere and there was nothing we could do about it</em>," Hendrick said. "<em>What I want to protect most here is the people</em>."</p>
<p>Unions can't prevent layoffs, but they can give those affected by them the best-case version of a worst-case scenario, and they can also improve the lives of workers in a number of other ways. Hopefully, the new Overwatch union and the other groups under Microsoft will be able to reach a deal sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>"<em>I'm organizing because I believe in this company, our teams, and the work we do together. Unionizing is about having a seat at the table so that we can work with leadership to build better, more sustainable working conditions,</em>" said senior test analyst and organizing committee member Jess Castillo in the previously mentioned press release. "<em>Ultimately, when we're supported and thriving, we can deliver the best possible experiences to our players, which is what brought all of us here in the first place.</em>"</p>

			<p>DOOM, a series likely thought dead during its twelve-year hiatus (not including re-releases) between DOOM 3 and 2016's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM reboot</a>, is on a high. The success of DOOM, followed by the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM Eternal</a>, means it was inevitable that a new release would come. What I didn't expect was the direction of that, which is where DOOM: The Dark Ages comes in.</p>
<p>By abandoning multiplayer and opting for a pure single-player and narrative-focused experience, DOOM: The Dark Ages takes the series somewhere different and a little medieval.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal. It focuses on an earlier incursion of hell and explains why the Doom Slayer is who he is. Long story short, the Makyrs essentially had him tethered as their slave-weapon, keeping him trapped unless they needed him, just pointing him towards the demons they wanted killed. The series has never really been narrative-heavy, and I'm not going to pretend that it somehow is now, but I do like what they've done here.</p>
<p>Despite his general lack of depth, the Doom Slayer is a surprisingly good character. In the previous games, you could understand perfectly what he was thinking in every circumstance, and that thought is essentially "Kill demons, F- everything else". While he's already in this frame of mind, you will get to see more of his time while under the control of the Makyr, during the invasion of Argent D'nur. You will also meet far more characters than in any other title in the series (that I remember). Where the lore in previous games was relegated to reading the codex entries, here you get it through cutscenes and other monologues. The Doom Slayer is still as vocal as always.</p>
<p>I won't cover more of the story to avoid spoilers, but I've enjoyed the change in direction. This is despite my saying in my DOOM Eternal review that I don't care about the story in a DOOM game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Let's be brutally honest: most people don't come into a DOOM game because of its narrative, including DOOM: The Dark Ages. Having it, and a good one, is just the icing on the extremely bloody and demonic cake. No, people come for the gameplay, the gory fun stuff, and I would argue that it's fun. Clearing what may be a sticking point for some people, I don't care about the lack of a multiplayer mode. Most people know me enough that a multiplayer mode is usually a negative, not a positive.</p>
<p>Rather than including multiplayer, DOOM: The Dark Ages includes the longest campaign in the series. Across 22 different stages, each offering a good level of variety, you will be doing everything from the regular run-and-gun DOOM action, to hopping in an Atlan - a giant humanoid war machine - or even riding a dragon into battle. Add a host of weapons, some returning, others new (including a flail, to stick to the medieval-style theme), and you have exciting demon-murdering gameplay, still joined by melee finishing moves to replenish your health and ammo. As a note, the traditional glory kills are gone unless it's a boss, which some may be disappointed with.</p>
<p>The actual run-and-gun gameplay feels more grounded than in DOOM Eternal, closer to that of DOOM (2016). This isn't to say there isn't any verticality, there is, but it no longer feels like it has delusions of being a secret-platformer. There likely isn't anything here that you won't find familiar if you've played the first game. Every weapon and ability has its use; each can be upgraded with the various currencies and items found throughout the game.</p>
<p>Much like the previous titles, the weapons are well placed within the game, meaning when you need one, it'll be introduced, with a quick tutorial. I recommend reading these because you may miss some of the bonuses weapons can bring. For example, one of the earliest ones can overcharge the energy shields of enemies, causing them to explode. Knowing the additional effects and upgrading the weapons to give them new abilities can be extremely useful in your quest to kill everything that breathes, has ever breathed, and will ever breathe.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Despite my praise of returning to a more horizontal gameplay, I have a few criticisms. Okay, one. I don't like the dragon and anything to do with it. It's cool, but when I'm flying a dragon, it should not be locked into a near horizontal plane once I'm locked onto an enemy. I'm flying a dragon with guns. I want to be able to swoop in and shoot, and I want to do strafing runs. It looks and comes across like it should be aerial combat, but the actual combat feels nothing like that.</p>
<p>This isn't to say it doesn't fit in with the world or narrative, but there is a disconnect between what it is and how it feels like it should be. Particularly when flying outside of combat, which is free-flowing. My thoughts on this don't extend to other things, such as the Atlan, which does fit in well with the rest of the game. It feels slower paced, as expected from a giant mech, but it doesn't feel like it should be something else. Granted, I can imagine some people being frustrated by the slower pace compared to the core gameplay.</p>
<p>Still, these are minor issues in the grand scheme. It's a long campaign packed with DOOM goodness, including finding secrets, codex entries, and more. Exploration is, as always, rewarded. It also does exceptionally well opening up the game on some levels, giving you a vast map to play in and tackle objectives in the way you want. Eschewing the linearity gives it a fresher feel at times, and it's also handy to turn back around and replenish some stocks if you've found that you're struggling in a fight.</p>
<p>It's all tied together with excellent visuals and audio. Now, this being a DOOM game, and it being 2025, that's like saying "the sun will rise in the morning". I still can't emphasise enough that the aesthetics and design of DOOM: The Dark Age are excellent, particularly when you start venturing away from Argent. Add the usual metal riff to this, and you've got a successful, pulse-pounding action and blood-filled game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>So, to put it all quite simply, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a good game—no, it's a very good game. I would recommend it to fans of the genre and people who want to have fun without the risk of anything transmissible via bodily fluids. Unless we're talking about demon blood and guts, there's lots of that. DOOM: The Dark Ages is yet another success from Id Software, and long may they continue.</p>
