            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Exactly a week after <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping the first 'Features Overview' video dedicated to the open world and story of <strong>Crimson Desert</strong></a>, developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has released the second entry in the series. The new video dives deep into the action/adventure RPG's combat mechanics and character progression ahead of its <strong>March 19, 2026</strong> launch date. The showcase reveals a combat system designed around fluidity, expressiveness, and player choice, combined with progression paths that, according to the developers, will reward exploration and experimentation.</p>



<p><strong>At the heart of Crimson Desert's combat are weapon variety and seamless skill chaining</strong>. Players can wield an arsenal of weapons, ranging from classic swords and shields to spears, greatswords, axes, and ranged weapons, each offering distinct tactical advantages. Pearl Abyss highlighted that <strong>attacks will flow naturally between weapon strikes, bare-hand combat, kicks, and grapples</strong>, allowing players to build highly customizable combo chains. Elemental enhancements such as burn, freeze, and stun effects further deepen the tactical layer, giving the player tools to adapt to different enemy types and situations.</p>



<p>The developers took great care to ensure mobility played a crucial role in maintaining combat momentum. Slides, dodges, counters, and swings are directly integrated into attack sequences, creating what Pearl Abyss describes as <strong>"combat that feels grounded yet explosive and endlessly expressive."</strong> Perfectly timed guards and dodges don't just protect—they open counter windows that keep players on the offensive. The system rewards skillful timing and positioning over button mashing, encouraging players to master the rhythm of each encounter. Beyond direct combat, the game also features environmental and mount-based combat. <strong>Players can leverage their surroundings and utilize various mounts to shift battlefield dynamics</strong>.</p>



<p>The progression journey begins with protagonist Kliff at his lowest point. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/crimson-desert-everything-we-know-about-the-new-open-world-fantasy-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As mentioned in our game info roundup article</a></strong>, he's a survivor of the Black Bears' devastating assault on the Greymanes with minimal abilities and equipment at his disposal. <strong>Players must gradually rebuild Kliff into a formidable warrior</strong>, with every advancement shaped by player-driven choices.</p>



<p>Central to the character progression in Crimson Desert is the <strong>Artifact System</strong>, where <strong>Abyss fragments collected from quests, boss victories, and exploration unlock core stat boosts like Health and Stamina increases</strong>. These fragments also grant new skills that extend combo chains and enhance existing abilities. In a nice twist, some advanced techniques require players to observe them firsthand in the world before they can be learned.</p>



<p>Each player will most likely build a different version of Kliff. They might prioritize stamina upgrades to enable longer exploration sessions and extended gliding across Pywel's vast regions, or they could focus on unlocking diverse grappling techniques to dominate melee combat. <strong>The skill combination system and upgrade paths are designed to reflect individual playstyles, ensuring no two players' Kliff will develop identically</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The video then mentioned that equipment crafting and customization offer another layer of progression. Gear can be purchased from merchants, discovered in hidden locations, or crafted from raw materials gathered through mining, hunting, and quest completion. <strong>Boss encounters in particular will serve as both tests of mastery and sources of unique rewards</strong>. Fearsome adversaries ranging from human opponents to beasts, mechanical constructs, and magical entities await throughout the continent. <strong>Defeating these bosses yields exclusive equipment imbued with their signature abilities and special effects</strong>. Before closing the video, Pearl Abyss teased a third and final Features Overview coming ahead of the game's launch. If it follows the current schedule, it should drop on Thursday, February 12.</p>



<p>In other Crimson Desert news, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-2-million-wishlists-middle-the-witcher-3-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just surpassed two million wishlists</a></strong>. Pearl Abyss PR Director Will Powers also recently shared a couple of tidbits about the game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the main campaign is only a small percentage of the overall content available</a>, and the balance between narrative and gameplay sits in the middle between <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> and <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>.</p>

			<p>Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted its own quarterly financial report</a>, revealing that <strong>PS5 shipments have now reached 92.2 million units</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up from 84.2 million units declared in the previous quarter</a>. This means that Sony sold <span><strong>8 million PlayStation 5 consoles in its fiscal Q3</strong>, a rather significant (<strong>-15.8%</strong>) decrease from</span> Q3 2024. </p>



<p>This is only slightly offset by marginally better PS5 shipments in Q1 and Q2 2025 compared to the previous year. Overall, in FY 2024, <strong>Sony had shipped 15.7 million units as of Q3</strong>, whereas this year, the total fiscal year sales to date amount to <strong>14.4 million units</strong>, or <strong>-8.3%</strong>.</p>



<p>Despite the downward trajectory, cumulative PS5 shipments are not at all far from where the PlayStation 4 was at the same point in its lifecycle. The PS4 had sold <strong>94.4 million units</strong>, but <strong>it also faced far less adversity than the PS5 did</strong>; the most recent Sony console had to deal with the semiconductor shortage at first, and now the RAM shortages aren't helping, either. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SDKTavm-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Credits to ResetEra's Red Kong XIX for making this chart: <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-reaches-92-2-million-lifetime-console-units-shipped-8-million-units-last-quarter.1426120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-reaches-92-2-million-lifetime-console-units-shipped-8-million-units-last-quarter.1426120</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's far from all bad news for the PlayStation division, though. Full game software sales (between PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5) increased to <strong>97.2 million units</strong> sold, <strong>up 1.4%</strong> compared to last year. That's mostly thanks to first-party sales, which reached <strong>13.2 million units</strong> in the quarter, a <strong>13.8%</strong> increase compared to 2024's <strong>11.6 million units</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the game leading the charge was <strong>Ghost of Yōtei</strong> by <strong>Sucker Punch Productions</strong>, by far the biggest PS5 exclusive game released in FY 2025. Indeed, during the FY2025 Q3 earnings call, Sony Chief Financial Officer <strong>Lin Tao</strong> shared that the game has exceeded the sales of its predecessor, <strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong>, when launch aligned.</p>



<p>Sony did not provide an actual update to sales figures. However, we know that Ghost of Tsushima sold 2.4 million units in the first three days, but only reached 5 million units 118 days (nearly four months) after launch. By contrast, Ghost of Yotei sold 3.3 million units in 32 days. <strong>This means Tsushima must have taken slightly longer to reach that milestone</strong>. Even if it's only a marginal improvement, though, it's actually more meaningful when you consider that Tsushima was released at the height of the COVID pandemic and benefited from a much larger install base than Ghost of Yōtei. Given these positive sales figures, it's hard to imagine Sony won't greenlight a Ghost of Yōtei DLC, and indeed, the developers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-developer-doesnt-close-door-to-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have already suggested there's a chance it will happen</a></strong>.</p>



<p>At some point in 2026, Sucker Punch is scheduled to launch the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legends online co-op mode</a></strong>. It is also believed that <strong>the debut of Legends might coincide with the game's PC launch</strong>, though that's just speculation for now.</p>

<p>Complete The Shogun's Preparation: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">change this setting ASAP</strong> to improve combat flow and <strong>ultimately make fighting enemies more enjoyable.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-change-the-controls-to-type-b-asap">Change the Controls to Type B ASAP</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Controls-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Type B proved the best control scheme for me in Nioh 3 as it made it easier to use certain Martial Arts more consistently</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> comes with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">six control scheme options,</strong> which move some of the game's core combat actions between different buttons. While the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Type A control scheme</strong> generally works well (though you may need some time to adjust if you're coming straight from <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh 2</strong></a></em>) I have found in my over 50 hours with the game <strong>not to be the best</strong> for one specific reason: <strong>the difficulty to <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/">use some Martial Arts</a> consistently.</strong></p>



<p>As opposed to the first two entries in the series, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> assigns quite a few <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">critical Martial Arts</strong> in both Samurai and Ninja style to <strong>forward + button and back + button combinations</strong>, leaving the <strong>L1 /LB + button combination free for Guardian Spirit skills.</strong></p>



<p><strong>These button combinations make using specific Martial Arts really unreliable</strong>. While the forward + button combination is a little more reliable, I have had a lot of trouble using the back + button Martial Arts consistently, forcing me to <strong>buffer the input behind a regular attack string.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">this forces a playstyle that is not good for certain weapons</strong>. Take the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Ninja Style Hatchets</strong>, for example: assigned to the back + heavy attack slot is the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Dragonfly Martial Art</strong>, which is incredibly useful from a distance, but far riskier to use close to the enemy, a positioning the Type A controls essentially forced me into.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Type-B-better-controls-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Type B controls made me enjoy Nioh 3's combo potential in combat way more</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you, like me, are having trouble with these Martial Arts button combinations, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">switch the Control Type to B</strong>. This control scheme <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">restores the L1/LB + button combination for Martial Arts</strong> from previous entries in the series, switching the <strong>Guardian Skill button combos to L1/LB + up and L1/LB + down on the directional pad.</strong></p>



<p>The difference, you will soon notice, will be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">night and day</strong>, no matter your weapon of choice. In my case, I was able to use the Samurai Dual Swords counterattack <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Punish the Proud</strong> Martial Art previously assigned to back + heavy attack <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">much more consistently</strong>. Aerial combat in Ninja Style was also significantly improved, as aerial Martial Arts became more reliable with more consistent execution.</p>

			<p>Just a few hours after <strong>AMD CEO</strong> <strong>Lisa Su</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-steam-machine-will-start-shipping-early-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly shared that they expected the <strong>Steam Machine</strong> to start shipping in <strong>early 2026</strong></a>, <strong>Valve</strong> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steam_hardware/announcements/detail/625565405086220584?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an update</a> revealing there will actually be a slight delay.</p>



<p>In a blog post dedicated to launch timing and other FAQs for the whole family of upcoming <strong>Steam Hardware</strong> products, Valve admitted they've had to revisit the shipping schedule and pricing <strong>due to the ongoing memory and storage shortages <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that have hit the tech industry hard</a></strong>. They had hoped to be able to share both the launch and price details by now, but that just wasn't possible yet, with the Steam Machine and <strong>Steam Frame</strong> particularly affected (while, on the other hand, the <strong>Steam Controller</strong> obviously won't include any RAM or storage; but Valve wants to start selling it alongside the other two).</p>



<p>Valve's goal is to launch all of the products <strong>in the first half of 2026</strong>. From the sound of it, though, they are now targeting the latter months of Spring, perhaps toward May or June, whereas before it really sounded like it could have launched in March or April.</p>



<p><strong>Customers are certainly worried more about the pricing</strong> than the slight delay. The RAM shortage has driven component prices to absurd levels, and even console manufacturers like <strong>Nintendo</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-must-monitor-the-situation-closely-current-high-ram-prices-wont-immediately-impact-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haven't definitively ruled out price bumps for their hardware</a> if the situation doesn't improve. The Steam Machine was already going to have a hefty price tag, at least compared to a typical console, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because Valve won't subsidize it</a></strong>. Earlier this year, a Czech retailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-price-leak-valve/">listed a price of <strong>$950</strong> for the base model with 512GB of storage, while the 2TB model would cost </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-price-leak-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1070</a></strong>. Those prices are not confirmed by any means, though.</p>



<p>In the new blog post, Valve also shared a few FAQs for the Steam Hardware family. </p>



<h2 id="h-steam-machine">Steam Machine</h2>



<ul>
<li>Valve reiterated that most Steam games can run at 4K@60FPS on the Steam Machine with AMD FSR. However, <strong>they also acknowledged that some titles will be more taxing, and users might need to play at a lower frame rate with VRR enabled and a 1080p internal resolution</strong>. Meanwhile, they are working on HDMI VRR, <strong>investigating improved upscaling</strong>, and <strong>optimizing ray tracing performance</strong> in the Steam Machine driver.</li>



<li>It was confirmed that the <strong>SSD</strong> (NVMe 2230 or 2280) and <strong>RAM</strong> (DDR5 SODIMMs) are both <strong>user-accessible and upgradable</strong>.</li>



<li>In the coming months, Valve will begin sharing faceplate CAD models, specs, and details so manufacturers can make and sell third-party faceplates to users.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-steam-frame">Steam Frame</h2>



<ul>
<li>Streaming services should work in a 'theatrical browser mode'.</li>



<li><strong>People wearing glasses shouldn't have problems with the Steam Frame</strong>, though it depends on the width of the glasses. Still, Valve would like to make prescription lens inserts available ahead of launch.</li>



<li>The Steam Frame will include a new feature called <strong>Foveated Streaming</strong>. Based on the eye-tracking data, the PC streams high-resolution data only to the portion of the viewport the player is looking at. This is a system-level feature, so it can be applied to all games to improve performance. Furthermore, it can stack with <strong>Foveated Rendering</strong> (which allows a game to render only the portion the player is looking at) if the game supports that feature.</li>



<li>The <strong>Valve Index</strong> will continue to be supported by Valve, as it has in the past.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-steam-controller">Steam Controller</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Steam Controller is expected to work with any game compatible with the Steam Overlay, even if they aren't actually on Steam.</li>
</ul>
