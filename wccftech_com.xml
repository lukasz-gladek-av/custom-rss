			<p>Today, developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have released a new trailer for the highly anticipated game Elden Ring: Nightreign. The video is dedicated to the Ironeye class, one of the classes players will be able to pick while in the game.</p>
<p>According to the official brief, the ethos of the Ironeye is to strike from afar with ranged attacks and deadly precision. They start with a bow and specialize in dexterity-based weapons. The class brings damage and utility to parties brave enough to sojourn into Limveld. Experienced players will also recognize the usefulness of ranged attacks - being able to revive downed party members from a distance during a run can make the difference between surviving the night and not living to see another day. While the Ironeye starts with ranged attacks and has ranged Ultimates, like all Nightfarers, they can use any weapon they discover during a run.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Ironeye Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wQ4uE_TPdE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There will be four more classes (or Nightfarers, as they are described in the game) in Elden Ring: Nightreign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wylder - A balanced all-rounder, effective both in speed and attack power.</li>
<li>Guardian - A tank with heavy attacks and increased damage resistance.</li>
<li>Duchess - A nimble hero with quick attacks and a strong evasive ability.</li>
<li>Recluse - A caster with ranged magical abilities and a healing-based skill</li>
</ul>
<p>These Nightfarers still have to get their dedicated trailers, though. This is likely to happen in short order, given that the game is less than two months away from its planned May 30 launch date.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking out Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> during the recent Closed Beta Test, Wccftech's Francesco De Meo was eager to play more:</p>
<p><em>FromSoftware isn't just combining its trademark gameplay mechanics with co-op and roguelike mechanics, it is doing so masterfully to deliver an experience that has a lot of potential and could really shine with some tweaks based on the feedback from these pre-release tests.</em></p>
<p>In less than eight weeks, we'll know if FromSoftware can deliver another hit even in a spin-off game dedicated to multiplayer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-4k-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Doom and gloom settled on Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-offer-4k-output/">yesterday</a> when it was revealed that the system's devkits don't support 4K resolution outputs. However, there's a good indication that this won't be the case, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4194#post-1702829">Famiiboards forums member Serif</a> provided some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jozskd/the_switch_2_dock_uses_a_realtek_rtd2175ncg/">additional details</a> about the dock's Realtek RTD2175N-CG chipset. Information on this precise model cannot be found online, but the closest model, the RTDN2173 chipset, which is likely a predecessor to the Nintendo Switch 2 dock's chipset, supports DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI HDCP 2.2/1.4 and HDR, as well as video resolutions from 720p up to 8K60Hz, so the dock will be able to output 4K resolution, although it remains to be seen if 4K resolution will be supported by games. Still, even if 4K resolution output is only limited to the system's UI, it will still be a massive improvement over the original Switch, whose interface looks terrible on large 4K screens.</p>
<p>Even without the unlikely lack of 4K resolution support, the Nintendo Switch 2 is setting up to be a massive upgrade over the original system. The console's controllers will also receive some significant upgrades, as the new Pro Controller will likely feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrade-dev-kits/">a headphone jack</a>, suggesting better voice chat support for the new system as well. Thankfully, it won't be long until we finally learn everything there is to know about the Nintendo Switch 2 and how much it will actually be an improvement over its predecessor, as the console will finally be fully unveiled tomorrow, April 2nd.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-studios-very-well-suited-for-hexen-and-heretic-remasters-lead-engine-dev-says/">Nightdive Studios</a> has made it their bread-and-butter to be the team you want remaking and remastering older games. If there's any game you loved when you were a kid that's currently trapped on aging hardware and not easily playable on modern machines, Nightdive is the team you'd want remastering that game.</p>
<p>So far, Nightdive has remastered and remade a number of classics, including its excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/system-shock-remake-shodan-establishes-dominance/">System Shock Remake</a>, The Thing Remastered, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-announces-turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-for-pc-ps5-ps4-switch-and-xbox-one/">Turok</a> franchise, and Star Wars: Dark Forces Remastered, to name a few. The studio has no intention of sticking to games from a certain era, though, and it is looking to take on games from the seventh generation consoles, namely PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/">VGC</a><span>, Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive Studios, said, "<em>We stand ready</em>," on the subject of remastering and remaking seventh-gen games. However, both Kuperman and Stephen Kick, chief executive officer at Nightdive</span>, added that there are plenty of considerations for remastering seventh-gen games.</p>
<p>"<em>I would begin asking a couple of questions,</em>" said Kuperman. "<em>Was it Xbox 360 exclusive, or was there a PC version out too? Because that also changes things, the little preservation that’s available. Do we have source code? If so, what’s the quality of the source code? How about the assets? Those are the kinds of considerations that we have there. That being said, there were some really good games that came out in that era that shouldn’t be lost.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick then used the 2008 first-person shooter Haze as an example of a game that he and the team at Nightdive believe should be remastered.</p>
<p>"<em>To your point, though, with a game like Haze – let’s say hypothetically we had access to that, and that was our big title for 2028, right? – We would go to the original designers, and we would say: ‘It didn’t do as well as you had hoped, I’m sure you’ve had a lot of time to ruminate and to think about what you would have done differently.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick added that, specifically with Nightdive's remaster of System Shock 2, speaking to the original developers solved many of the issues they were working on, as they could hear directly from the original creators what steps Nightdive should take to properly recreate the original vision.</p>
<p>When it comes to remastering seventh-gen games, the big hang-up has never been games that were available on Xbox 360 or PC in that era. The PlayStation 3's unique CELL architecture has been the infamous roadblock that's kept plenty of PS3-exclusive titles landlocked on Sony's old grill-looking console.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge, Kick is certain that Nightdive is up to the task.</p>
<p><em>"I think that architecture – I mean, I remember the talk when the system was first released, of how difficult it was for developers to ‘get’ it – and that’s a big problem with backwards compatibility [...] So yeah, if we get to that – or I should say when – we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face. But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</em></p>
<p>Kuperman also added that part of Nightdive's advantage is their internal engine, which has helped them remaster and remake games from multiple eras of consoles. Hopefully, it turns out to be the ace up Nightdive's sleeve to make them the go-to studio for bringing PS3 games into the modern gaming landscape.</p>
