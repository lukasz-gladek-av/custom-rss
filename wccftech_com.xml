			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console will be unveiled sometime in January and will be released only two months after its reveal, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime">Nintendo Prime</a>, a rumor discovered on Weibo suggests the new Nintendo console will be finally revealed in January for a March 2025 release, possibly towards the end of the month. As for production and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/">shipment of units</a>, over 650,000 units have already been shipped in various regions, and a huge quantity of components has been produced since September.</p>

<p>While a random post on a Chinese forum is generally not a very reliable source, things are different in this particular case. As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1bmwo/update_on_the_rumor_switch_2_will_be_revealed_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, this user got a lot of Nintendo announcements right before they were made in the past and has since deleted all of their posts. Some of the announcements that were gotten right were pretty difficult to guess, such as The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky The First remake announcement, so it definitely looks like this user has access to insider information in some way.</p>
<p>Despite the source of the rumor looking reliable, we have to take what they have revealed about the Nintendo Switch 2 with a grain of salt until the system is finally revealed and dated, which shouldn't take too long if these rumors are correct. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Palworld to Get Massive New Island Next Month]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Palworld will receive a big update next month. Its main attraction is a new and 'mysterious' island, which is said to be six times as large as Sakurajima, the previous island to be added to the game. Players will find 'powerful tower bosses' and many new Pals in this new location, and there will also be a sizable amount of new content. The game is also currently discounted by 25%, making it a great time to jump into Palworld for newcomers.</p>
<p>Moreover, PocketPair has confirmed a collaboration with Terraria, the massively successful indie game released in 2011. This collaboration will take place next year, though there are no further details on what will be included.</p>
<p>Following the incredible success enjoyed at launch, when Palworld surprisingly secured the second place on Steam's all-time concurrent players chart (it would later be surpassed by Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong), the game's development slowed down a bit. However, PocketPair recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-trailer-still-gets-showcased-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> the game on PlayStation 5, welcoming a whole new player base, and it is now being developed for mobile platforms, too, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-coming-to-mobile-with-pubg-publisher-krafton-securing-global-license-for-the-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with PUBG's Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>One platform where players will never be able to play this game is the Nintendo Switch. In fact, after much deliberation, Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> PocketPair for patent infringement. Recently, the Japanese independent studio <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> more details about the lawsuit. Nintendo alleges that the following three patents were infringed upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patent No. 7545191<br>
[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]</li>
<li>Patent No. 7493117<br>
[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]</li>
<li>Patent No. 7528390<br>
[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</li>
</ul>
<p>As a remedy, Nintendo asks for an injunction against Palworld (which would remove it from being available to players) and two payments of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to The Pokémon Company and Nintendo Co., Ltd.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horizon Zero Dawn Clone Light of Motiram Announced for PC]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc.1047228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've seen game clones in our day, but perhaps none has ever been so blatantly inspired by a game like Light of Motiram, a newly announced open world game that practically mimics every key visual element of Guerrilla's Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>
<p>Young redhead female protagonist? Check. Gorgeous natural environments to explore following the collapse of civilization? Check. Animal-like machines? Check, check, check. Big boss fights that require precise timing and execution? You got the gist.</p>
<p>To be honest, Palworld is far more removed from Pokemon by comparison, and that one has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a lawsuit from Nintendo anyway. We'll see if Sony moves to sue as well. It would have to go against Tencent, as the developer of Light of Motiram is Polaris Quest, one of the Chinese giant's subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Anyway, to be fair, there are a few gameplay differences compared to Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Forbidden West. To start with, this game features extensive survival and building mechanics:</p>
<p><em>In this mechanical wilderness where civilization is a distant memory, primal cultures, extreme weather, and lurking Mechanimals will constantly test your survival skills. Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses. Every step is fraught with danger and requires courage.</em></p>
<p><em>Unleash your creativity with a freeform building system powered by realistic physics simulation. Construct a fortified stronghold or a cleverly designed shelter. Every beam and brick is subject to real-world physical forces, ensuring that your structures are both visually stunning and able to withstand environmental challenges.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_liwn7B7As?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The taming and training mechanics are also far more in-depth than in Guerrilla's game. Light of Motiram promises over a hundred customizable Mechanimals to tame and train.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the game supports seamless cooperative multiplayer for up to ten players to adventure together. The official description also mentions cross-play, although Light of Motiram has only been announced for PC and will be released via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/light-of-motiram-094dff?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> at an unannounced time. By the way, minimum and recommended system requirements are already available and should not be a problem for anyone who has built a gaming PC in the last five or six years.</p>
