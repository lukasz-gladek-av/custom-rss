<p>Metal Eden is a sci-fi FPS title where you get to explore a world where humanity's consciousness is no longer being held in captivity in the flesh and now resides within robots. There will be eight missions for you to make your way through, with a handcrafted universe to explore. This game will see you plunged into an artificial world full of cybernetic warfare, where you'll be given the opportunity to take control of a hyper unit while also exploring the world and uncovering the mysteries of the futuristic world before you.</p>
<p>In Metal Eden, you take on the role of ASKA, which is an advanced Hyper Unit android that has been built around a digitized human psyche. The architecture in the world around you is bathed in neon lights, helping to immerse you into the cyber-futuristic world in front of you, which has been named Moebius. As you explore Moebius, you will find yourself participating in the ongoing conflict over the souls of a lost human colony that are stored in cybernetic COREs.</p>
<p>On this journey, you are accompanied by your sentient spaceship named Nexus. As you progress through the story, you will expand and upgrade your arsenal, as well as make your robotic body even stronger and more robust to be able to continue fighting off enemies in a mechanical world. By fighting the diverse roster of enemies, you will have to extract energy cores that will provide you with an advantage on the battlefield. Along with upgrading your weaponry, you'll also get to upgrade and obtain new combat abilities that will make you a force of nature.</p>
<p>If you like parkour in your games, you'll want to keep an eye on Metal Eden, as you are able to dash, grapple, and wall-run your way through Moebius while taking on enemies in intense encounters.</p>
<p>Metal Eden will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on May 6, 2025.</p>

			<p>After several months of quiet, developer Build a Rocket Boy shared a new gameplay trailer for MindsEye, their story-driven action/adventure thriller game, during yesterday's State of Play broadcast. They also revealed that the game will be released this Summer on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by IO Interactive</a>.</p>
<p>Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye and former producer on GTA III, Vice City, San Andreas, GTA IV, and GTA V, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>I’ve dedicated my entire career to crafting captivating interactive entertainment to delight players. With MindsEye, we’ve pushed cinematic adventure to the next level - building characters and a world that feels truly alive. We can’t wait for players to step in and feel the immersive realism and tireless effort poured into every moment of the game.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Official Gameplay Trailer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSn42TbRngY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MindsEye is developed with the same technology that powers <a href="https://wccftech.com/everywhere-a-new-game-by-ex-gta-producer-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, the studio's ambitious user generated content (UGC) platform. In this game, players will become Jacob Diaz, who has received a mysterious neural implant (the titular MindsEye) which has left him with disjointed flashbacks of his time in the service.</p>
<p>Set in Redrock, a fictional desert metropolis in the not-too-distant future, MindsEye tells a story of artificial intelligence, human greed, and the struggle for control that has brought the Earth to the brink of collapse. Players will explore a richly detailed world, uncovering hidden conspiracies while navigating a deeply personal and high-stakes narrative.</p>
<p>MindsEye delivers intense combat where every decision is critical to survival. Players will engage in third-person shooter encounters, facing enemies that coordinate attacks, flush them from cover, and swarm with overwhelming force. Success depends on quick thinking, tactical positioning, and using the environment and a companion drone to gain the upper hand. There are also 'thrilling' high-speed chases that will push the player's driving skills to the limit, taking Jacob through a variety of environments, such as bustling cityscapes, remote industrial sites, trailer parks, and deserts. You can now wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
