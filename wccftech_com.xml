			<p>Owlcat Games announced that its next cRPG, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, will launch in Open Alpha on PC in Q4 2025. Thus, aspiring Inquisitors will soon be able to command a diverse warband, shaping the fate of the Imperium one decision at a time.</p>



<p>In Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a narrative-driven tactical RPG set in the grimdark universe created by Games Workshop, players lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption against the backdrop of Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star. These companions range from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary.</p>



<p>Featuring intricate investigations, a turn-based combat system, and choices with grave consequences, Dark Heresy promises to greatly expand on the ideas previously seen in Rogue Trader. Unlike that game, it will also feature fully voiced dialogue. You can find <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-gamescom-preview-inquisitors-are-always-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Gamescom 2025 preview here</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking about Rogue Trader, Owlcat also announced that the cRPG will soon be released for the Nintendo Switch 2. It will be the first game made by the developer to launch on the new platform. Previously, Owlcat had released a cloud-only version of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous for the first Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Rogue Trader earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo:</p>



<p><em>With the great amount of love for the setting that was poured into the game evident from every line of dialogue and every little detail, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is one of the best games based on the universe created by Games Workshop, and a solid tactical turn-based role-playing game that can provide hundreds of hours of fun.</em></p>



<p>The game has also been greatly refined over the past two years and has received two DLCs: <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-void-shadows-q-launch-had-way-too-many-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Void Shadows</a> and Lex Imperialis. Two more upcoming expansions have been announced. In the third expansion, players will enter a Necron vault curated by the iconic Trazyn the Infinite. There, they will challenge ancient guardians and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy. In the fourth DLC, players will explore the Processional of the Damned, a surreal graveyard of voidships where they will descend into madness and mystery.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game-spellcasters-chronicles/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spellcasters-chronicles-is-quantic-dream%E2%80%99s-new-f2p-3v3-competitive-multiplayer-game.1326817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after Quantic Dream <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">announced that it would be making a competitive multiplayer game</a>, the studio went ahead and revealed the game to be <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/en-US">Spellcasters Chronicles</a>, a free-to-play, 3v3 action-strategy game with third-person combat, where players clash in "<em>vertical arenas</em>."</p>



<p>You play as a 'Spellcaster,' and face off against other players in squads of three, in 25-minute battles where players have to capture altars, gain territory, and destroy the opposing squad's 'Lifestones' to achieve victory.</p>



<p>Spellcasters have their own spells they cast, though the more significant element of their gameplay seems to be summoning creatures to fight for you in these battles. Each Spellcaster has its own archetype though, so players can jump between them to find ones that suit their playstyle. Beyond those archetypes, you'll also be deck-building by selecting various spells and creatures to summon as part of our character's loadout.</p>



<p>Quantic Dream debuted a gameplay trailer for Spellcasters Chronicles, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SPELLCASTERS CHRONICLES | REVEAL TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEXC2rMYWTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios</em>," Quantic Dream co-founder and president David Cage says in a press release. "<em>Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together. This project reflects the creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades. With Spellcasters Chronicles, we sought to bring a new form of gaming experience blending action and strategy to life, while exploring community-driven narrative.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It has been an exploration of bold ideas, a chance to expand into social and multiplayer experiences, and an adventure shared by a new talented team of experts within our studios in Paris and Montreal who brought this original universe to life and are continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars: Eclipse</em>."</p>



<p>Quantic Dream will host a closed beta for the game at the end of 2025, which you can currently sign up for if you're keen to try Spellcasters Chronicles yourself. The closed beta is invite-only, so signing up doesn't ensure you a spot; it just puts you in the running for one.</p>



<p>While the gameplay trailer does its job of making the matches look interesting, even potentially exciting, how the game plays will be what decides its fate. It'll be interesting to see how players react when they get their hands on the game for the first time, which is happening much sooner than the closed beta.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, on October 17, at TwitchCon in San Diego, on the LAN stage, people will get to play Spellcasters Chronicles for the first time. We'll also get a gameplay deep dive of the game, and there will be a community Q&amp;A session for curious players to learn more about Spellcasters Chronicles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, for Quantic Dream's sake, it goes well. We'll see how the world reacts when we get a proper look at Spellcasters Chronicles.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-has-sold-over-7-million-units-in-3-days-making-it-the-biggest-franchise-launch-ever-says-ea.1326757/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Alinea Analytics' report that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had sold more than six and a half million units</a>, publisher Electronic Arts has now confirmed that the game has indeed sold more than seven million copies just in the first three days.</p>



<p>This means Battlefield 6 is officially the biggest franchise launch ever. Over 172 million matches were played online during the first weekend, and players accumulated over 15 million hours of streaming. As previously reported, the game also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered the most concurrent players in Battlefield history</a>. </p>



<p>Byron Beede, General Manager of Battlefield, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>First and foremost we want to thank our players. Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we've had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning - our first season of new content is just 12 days away.</em></p>



<p>Vince Zampella, Executive Vice President, added:</p>



<p><em>We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point. We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6’s momentous launch. We have so much more to come in the weeks ahead.</em></p>



<p>The game earned an 8.5 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review by David Carcasole</a>, who pointed out that while the single player campaign is lackluster, the multiplayer modes are rock solid, marking the franchise's comeback after Battlefield V and 2042.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the developers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-naval-warfare-reportedly-in-development-ea-battlefield-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly already working to add naval warfare</a>. On the live servers, they have also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-conquest-mode-players-arent-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced the starting ticket count on Conquest maps</a>, although that change didn't go over too well with the community.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ndt-massive-performance-hit-rtx-5080/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ndt-looks-stunning-but-performance-hit-is-massive-on-an-rtx-5080.1326685/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT mod breathes new life into the visuals of the classic game, but the performance cost is considerable—even on a top-end GPU like the RTX 5080.</p>



<p>The mod, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/">first work-in-progress release</a> was launched earlier this month, uses RTX Remix to overhaul the visuals of the iconic No Mercy campaign with realistic lighting, high-resolution PBR materials, and full compatibility with ray tracing technologies. </p>



<p>A fresh comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts the original game and the RTX Remix modded version running side-by-side, highlighting how the massive visual overhaul comes at a significant performance cost</p>



<p>While the performance difference varies between different scenarios, the hit is always dramatic. In one sequence (at the 1:10 mark), the modded Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT runs at an average of around 30 FPS at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. This is in sharp contrast to the vanilla game, which exceeds 500 FPS on the same RTX 5080 GPU.</p>



<p>The performance hit is similarly massive in another sequence (at 1:29), dropping from the high 500 FPS range down to the 50 FPS range. Once again, it’s clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">current gaming hardware can still not handle full path tracing</a> without heavily relying on upscaling and frame generation to hit playable framerates.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/quantic-dream-is-making-a-competitive-multiplayer-game-work-on-star-wars-eclipse-%E2%80%9Ccontinues%E2%80%9D.1326682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Quantic Dream, the studio co-founded by David Cage and known for single-player, story-driven games like Detroit: Become Human, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls, and is currently working on Star Wars: Eclipse, has announced that it is making a competitive multiplayer game.</p>



<p>"<em>For over 28 years, Quantic Dream has been pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling,</em>" co-founder David Cage writes in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">the opening of a blog post on the studio's website</a>, which announced the new competitive multiplayer title, a genre not exactly known for its storytelling.</p>



<p>"<em>After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step. Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been a part of our DNA.</em> <em>We know how demanding it is to create something new. Earning the trust of players, standing out in such a competitive space, and introducing fresh concepts is incredibly challenging. And since we have no legacy in this genre, we know we have everything to prove, which is why your support and feedback will be essential. Together, we believe we can create something truly unique</em>."</p>



<p>The singular mention of Star Wars: Eclipse comes in the following line, where all Cage says is, "<em>Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you</em> <em>in the future</em>." The last update we got for Star Wars: Eclipse before this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/">was in 2023, when the game was "<em>simmering</em>."</a> Since then, it's lead writer, who had been with Quantic Dream for years and led writing on games like Detroit: Become Human, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/">left and formed his own studio</a>.</p>



<p>To call this announcement a "<em>surprise</em>" is a grave understatement, since Quantic Dream is arguably the last studio anyone would expect to make a competitive multiplayer game. It's also a major risk, since we've seen multiple single-player, narrative-game-focused studios try to pivot to multiplayer games before, and failing miserably.</p>







<p>Of course, there's always the chance that the stars align for Cage and Quantic Dream, and whatever competitive multiplayer game they make becomes a huge success. We can always hope for the best outcome, but if the history of studios making a pivot like this can teach us anything, it's that Quantic Dream has a difficult, and more than likely ruinous path ahead of it.</p>
