			<p>Yesterday, news <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideaki-itsuno-brings-several-ex-capcom-developers-to-lightspeed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke</a> that Hideaki Itsuno had recruited several fellow former CAPCOM developers to his new LightSpeed Japan Studio, which is also opening a new office in Osaka in addition to the existing one in Tokyo.</p>



<p>Now, through <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-director-hideaki-itsuno-explains-why-he-left-capcom-and-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Itsuno has finally explained why he decided to leave CAPCOM around a year ago. As it turns out, it was mainly because the Japanese publisher would have put him on more Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma sequels, while the game designer wanted to do something new before he retires.</p>



<p><em>For me, based on my age, this is my last chance. The gaming industry has decreased the number of AAA releases, and I was asked to create a new AAA by Lightspeed. I’m not young anymore, so more than “now it’s the right moment,” it’s more like, “this is my last chance” to challenge myself. For Capcom, creating Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma sequels is always going to be the top priority, and keeping in mind that making a game takes 4 to 5 years, this might be my last big opportunity.</em></p>



<p><em>Before you realized you are working on making the Devil May Cry 6 or 7. It’s not like I don’t want to make them, I do, but it’s hard to balance the time it takes with the personal satisfaction of making them, and with Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon’s Dogma 2, I already did what I wanted to make.</em></p>



<p>It's definitely an understandable sentiment. Itsuno is certainly not the only veteran developer who recently decided to leave a big triple-A studio to work on something else of his own creation.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the developer says he is satisfied with how Dragon's Dogma 2 turned out (though personally, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I'd have to disagree on that</a>), and that he got more inspired by games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle than other action games after the release of Devil May Cry 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last Saturday, around 8 AM Pacific Time, Roblox <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bloxy.news/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> a new record for concurrent users on a gaming platform: 47.3 million users were online on August 23. That's 6.1 million concurrent users more than the peak registered by Valve's Steam platform in March: 41.2 million concurrent users. Earlier that month, Steam had <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-breaks-40-million-online-users-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the 40 million concurrent users milestone</a>.</p>



<p>Roblox's new peak is a massive jump compared to its previous record of 32.7 million users, which was set on another Saturday, July 19. Setting two records in the span of a month shows that the platform continues to grow nearly nineteen years after its original debut, which took place on September 1, 2006.</p>



<p>The game creation platform currently has two dominators: Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot. Together, they accounted for over 37 million of those concurrent users, meaning that more than 77% of the userbase was playing one of those games. Grow a Garden was the leader, with a peak of 22 million concurrent players, also a record for the highest concurrent peak ever recorded in a single game.</p>



<p>Originally developed by a sixteen-year-old player known only as BMWLux, Grow a Garden subsequently saw Splitting Point Studios and Do Big Studios purchasing shares and participating in its development. It's essentially an idle farming simulator where players start with a small plot of land and watch their plants grow into lovely flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Players can harvest and sell their produce to earn Sheckles, which can be used to purchase seeds, gear, eggs, and decorative items. They can also complete quests and participate in seasonal events to earn free seeds, gear, pets, and decorative items.</p>



<p>Steal a Brainrot also attracts many players to Roblox, with an estimated peak of 15 million concurrent players. This game was made by a user known as SpyderSammy, in partnership with another user known as do_small and developer Do Big Studios. It is described as a sort of tycoon experience where the goal of the game is to steal Brainrots from other players to earn money, which can be used to buy more Brainrots. However, others will try to steal yours, so you must defend them.</p>



<p>As a reminder, a couple of weeks ago, the state of Louisiana <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation, alleging that it is a breeding ground for sex predators and that its owners do not employ sufficient safety protocols to protect children.</p>

			<p>For well over a decade, Star Citizen creator Chris Roberts did not want to attach any definite release windows to his extremely ambitious sci-fi online multiplayer space simulation game. That has seemingly changed, as Canadian website LaPresse <a href="https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/entreprises/2025-08-22/jeu-video/le-studio-web-turbulent-devient-cloud-imperium-games-montreal.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> in an interview with Roberts that the game is expected to launch either in 2027 or 2028.</p>



<p>Considering that the game's early access for the persistent universe module launched on December 23, 2017, the early access would end around the ten-year mark, possibly threatening the existing record of 7 Days to Die: the survival horror game by The Fun Pimps launched in early access on December 13, 2013, while version 1.0 became available on July 25, 2024. </p>



<p>Star Citizen, currently in Alpha 4.3.0, <span>will be preceded by the single-player campaign Squadron 42. As you might recall, Cloud Imperium Games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;during last year's CitizenCon event that Squadron 42 would</span> be released in 2026. In the aforementioned interview, Chris Roberts expressed hopes that it will be nearly as hyped as a launch event as Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI, describing Squadron 42 as Top Gun mixed with Star Wars.</p>



<p><em>We're hoping it'll be almost as big an event. Other than GTA 6, it's probably the biggest-budget AAA game.</em> <em>It's Top Gun meets Star Wars. </em></p>



<p>Squadron 42 does include an ensemble cast of Hollywood stars who undoubtedly wanted to be paid well to lend their voices and likenesses to the game. Here's a comprehensive list:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gary Oldman</li>



<li>Mark Hamill</li>



<li>Gillian Anderson</li>



<li>Mark Strong</li>



<li>Liam Cunningham</li>



<li>Andy Serkis</li>



<li>John Rhys-Davies</li>



<li>Jack Huston</li>



<li>Eleanor Tomlinson</li>



<li>Harry Treadaway</li>



<li>Sophie Wu</li>



<li>Damson Idris</li>



<li>Eric Wareheim</li>



<li>Rhona Mitra</li>



<li>Henry Cavill</li>



<li>Ben Mendelsohn</li>
</ul>



<p>The $858 million dollar (and counting) question is, will Star Citizen and Squadron 42 meet fans' expectations after all these years? Vote in the poll below and share your opinion in the comments!</p>
