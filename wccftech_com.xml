			<p>Nintendo is about to pursue some new targets in its fight against piracy, and according to a new report, not even members of select subreddits are safe from the Japanese company.</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic">Game File,</a> in a recent filing in federal court, the Japanese company revealed that its investigation against Switch modder James Williams, also known as Archbox, has given it some new targets. During the investigation, Nintendo became aware of multiple other online actors who appeared to have a role in the Pirate Shops operation conducted by Archbox, and as such, is now seeking the go-ahead from the court to subpoena business records from internet domain companies Name Cheap, Go Daddy and Tucows, Cloudflare, GitHub, Discord, Google and Reddit to identify anyone who helped the modder with their illicit activities.</p>
<p>In Reddit's case, Nintendo outright mentions a specific subreddit called SwitchPirates, which was moderated by Archbox and currently has over 200,000 members. The Japanese company also has reason to believe that the modder had multiple accounts involved with the subreddit and that other prominent members played a role in the modder's activities. Once these people have been identified, Nintendo will use the obtained information to pursue infringement claims.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been waging its war against piracy for a very long time, but its activities in this regard have been ramped up recently. This year, the Japanese company shut down the most popular Nintendo Switch emulators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a>, possibly to prevent the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rom-emulate/">Nintendo Switch 2 from being emulated soon after its release.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it.1047327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We started <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-reportedly-still-due-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> over a year ago that Microsoft would build an Xbox mobile store to launch this year, following rumors from The Verge's Tom Warren. Shortly after, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-looking-to-build-xbox-mobile-store-with-the-help-of-some-partners-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the plan was real.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced Xbox mobile game sales via Web in July, but the real plan was to sell games directly through their Android app. Xbox president Sarah Bond previously said the goal was to start in November, but that did not happen, and the executive has now revealed why in a series of messages <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bondsarahbond.bsky.social/post/3lbxhvggn7d2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent on Blue Sky</a>.</p>
<p><em>At Xbox, we want to offer players more choice on how and where they play, including being able to play and buy games directly from the Xbox app. I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the U.S. while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand. Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned. Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision. We are eager to launch and give more choice and flexibility to players.</em></p>
<p>Essentially, Google is trying to block the launch (following Judge James Donato's ruling that Android is an illegal monopoly) of this feature on the Xbox app with a temporary administrative stay ahead of their appeal. However, the Android company has shared a statement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with The Verge</a> to illustrate its own perspective:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft has always been able to offer their Android users the ability to play and purchase Xbox games directly from their app – they’ve simply chosen not to. The Court’s order, and rush to force its implementation, threaten Google Play’s ability to provide a safe and secure experience. Microsoft, like Epic, are ignoring these very real security concerns. We remain focused on supporting an ecosystem that works for everyone, not just two of the largest game companies.</em></p>
<p>Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1861995680752918586?t=ImJiuaUBU2BX0SLRle_Ezg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was quick to jump on this response</a>, attacking Google in the process:</p>
<p><em>Google’s statement is deceitful. Shame on them. They well know that the 30% cut they demand is far more than all of the profit from game streaming. They know this because they blew hundreds of millions of dollars building the failed Stadia game business themselves.</em></p>
<p>Sweeney was, of course, leading the charge against both Google and Apple in an effort to open up their respective app stores for everyone. The Epic Games Store <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile in August, bringing back Fortnite to iOS (only in Europe for now) after a lengthy and costly legal fight.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-to-be-revealed-in-january-for-a-march-2025-release-%E2%80%93-rumor.1047306/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console will be unveiled sometime in January and will be released only two months after its reveal, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintyPrime">Nintendo Prime</a>, a rumor discovered on Weibo suggests the new Nintendo console will be finally revealed in January for a March 2025 release, possibly towards the end of the month. As for production and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/">shipment of units</a>, over 650,000 units have already been shipped in various regions, and a huge quantity of components has been produced since September.</p>
<p><iframe title="RUMOR: Nintendo Switch 2 is Releasing in March 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tItqYDzDoIE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a random post on a Chinese forum is generally not a very reliable source, things are different in this particular case. As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1bmwo/update_on_the_rumor_switch_2_will_be_revealed_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, this user got a lot of Nintendo announcements right before they were made in the past and has since deleted all of their posts. Some of the announcements that were gotten right were pretty difficult to guess, such as The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky The First remake announcement, so it definitely looks like this user has access to insider information in some way.</p>
<p>Despite the source of the rumor looking reliable, we have to take what they have revealed about the Nintendo Switch 2 with a grain of salt until the system is finally revealed and dated, which shouldn't take too long if these rumors are correct. We will keep you updated on the matter as soon as possible, so stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month.1047249/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, PocketPair <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Palworld will receive a big update next month. Its main attraction is a new and 'mysterious' island, which is said to be six times as large as Sakurajima, the previous island to be added to the game. Players will find 'powerful tower bosses' and many new Pals in this new location, and there will also be a sizable amount of new content. The game is also currently discounted by 25%, making it a great time to jump into Palworld for newcomers.</p>
<p>Moreover, PocketPair has confirmed a collaboration with Terraria, the massively successful indie game released in 2011. This collaboration will take place next year, though there are no further details on what will be included.</p>
<p>Following the incredible success enjoyed at launch, when Palworld surprisingly secured the second place on Steam's all-time concurrent players chart (it would later be surpassed by Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong), the game's development slowed down a bit. However, PocketPair recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-trailer-still-gets-showcased-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> the game on PlayStation 5, welcoming a whole new player base, and it is now being developed for mobile platforms, too, thanks to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-coming-to-mobile-with-pubg-publisher-krafton-securing-global-license-for-the-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with PUBG's Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>One platform where players will never be able to play this game is the Nintendo Switch. In fact, after much deliberation, Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> PocketPair for patent infringement. Recently, the Japanese independent studio <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> more details about the lawsuit. Nintendo alleges that the following three patents were infringed upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patent No. 7545191<br>
[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]</li>
<li>Patent No. 7493117<br>
[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]</li>
<li>Patent No. 7528390<br>
[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]<br>
[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</li>
</ul>
<p>As a remedy, Nintendo asks for an injunction against Palworld (which would remove it from being available to players) and two payments of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to The Pokémon Company and Nintendo Co., Ltd.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horizon Zero Dawn Clone Light of Motiram Announced for PC]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc.1047228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've seen game clones in our day, but perhaps none has ever been so blatantly inspired by a game like Light of Motiram, a newly announced open world game that practically mimics every key visual element of Guerrilla's Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>
<p>Young redhead female protagonist? Check. Gorgeous natural environments to explore following the collapse of civilization? Check. Animal-like machines? Check, check, check. Big boss fights that require precise timing and execution? You got the gist.</p>
<p>To be honest, Palworld is far more removed from Pokemon by comparison, and that one has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a lawsuit from Nintendo anyway. We'll see if Sony moves to sue as well. It would have to go against Tencent, as the developer of Light of Motiram is Polaris Quest, one of the Chinese giant's subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Anyway, to be fair, there are a few gameplay differences compared to Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Forbidden West. To start with, this game features extensive survival and building mechanics:</p>
<p><em>In this mechanical wilderness where civilization is a distant memory, primal cultures, extreme weather, and lurking Mechanimals will constantly test your survival skills. Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses. Every step is fraught with danger and requires courage.</em></p>
<p><em>Unleash your creativity with a freeform building system powered by realistic physics simulation. Construct a fortified stronghold or a cleverly designed shelter. Every beam and brick is subject to real-world physical forces, ensuring that your structures are both visually stunning and able to withstand environmental challenges.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_liwn7B7As?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The taming and training mechanics are also far more in-depth than in Guerrilla's game. Light of Motiram promises over a hundred customizable Mechanimals to tame and train.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the game supports seamless cooperative multiplayer for up to ten players to adventure together. The official description also mentions cross-play, although Light of Motiram has only been announced for PC and will be released via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/light-of-motiram-094dff?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> at an unannounced time. By the way, minimum and recommended system requirements are already available and should not be a problem for anyone who has built a gaming PC in the last five or six years.</p>
