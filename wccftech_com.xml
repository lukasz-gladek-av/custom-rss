			<p>Microsoft is blaming Apple for the delay of its Xbox mobile store launch. The report comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from The Verge</a>, which found out that the Windows and Xbox company filed an amicus brief supporting Epic Games' fight against Apple.</p>
<p>While the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-appointed-to-accept-no-tax-ruling-on-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent ruling</a> cracked the door wide open for the Epic Games Store and for the Xbox mobile store on iOS, Microsoft is wary of Apple's inevitable appeal and, as such, has filed a detailed argument in favor of the current ruling.&nbsp;Here's an excerpt from the filing:</p>
<p><em>The district court’s injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store — accessible via link-out — for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple. Prior to the district court’s most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple’s new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft’s communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction.</em></p>
<p><em>Similarly, Microsoft has long sought to enable Xbox app users on iOS to both buy and stream games in the app from the cloud or their other devices. Apple’s policies have restricted Microsoft’s ability to offer these functionalities together; the injunction allows Microsoft to explore this possibility. Microsoft’s own experience managing app stores confirms that Apple’s policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal.</em></p>
<p>The Xbox mobile store was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-to-launch-mobile-store-via-web-in-july-microsoft-sees-tremendous-growth-in-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to launch in July 2024</a>. When we last heard about the topic in late November, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed Google</a> for trying to block it from launching on its Android ecosystem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-game-director-leaves-obsidian-to-join-netflix/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed Game Director Carrie Patel has left Obsidian after over 11 years to join Netflix, specifically the Night School Studio responsible for the Oxenfree franchise. Patel herself provided the announcement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330425052565307393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on her LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
<p>The news is rather unexpected, to be honest. Following the successful launch of Avowed, Patel <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> her interest in doing more in the same world now that the team had found its groove, so to speak:</p>
<p><em>Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it.</em></p>
<p>There didn't seem to be any issues between Patel and Obsidian. It's possible she simply got a better job offer and decided to take it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Night School Studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-lays-off-employees-at-oxenfree-maker-night-school-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered an unknown number of layoffs just three months ago</a>. Following the 2023 debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-familiar-yet-distant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</a>, the Californian studio has just released the mobile life simulation game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.Venice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thronglets</a>, based on the Black Mirror IP. However, given Patel's long-standing expertise in the RPG genre (she also worked on the two Pillars of Eternity games and The Outer Worlds), it seems likely that Night School Studio could be heading toward that kind of game for their next project.</p>
<p>As for Avowed, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent action roleplaying game</a> has just received a <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-announces-its-2025-roadmap-for-avowed-update-1-4-patch-notes-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed roadmap of updates.</a> The Summer patch will add new NPC abilities and behaviors, new active and passive abilities, new Unique armor and weapons, cooking and crafting improvements, and custom map markers. The Fall update will introduce the highly requested Photo Mode and New Game Plus, a new weapon type, the ability for players to change their character's appearance while out in the world, new character presets in the creation tool, and more Godlike feature character presets.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rayman AAA Game in the Works at Ubisoft Milan]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan.1194840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Once upon a time, earlier in its history as a game developer and publisher, Ubisoft was mainly known for Rayman, rather than Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, or Rainbow Six. The weird-looking character quickly became a fan favorite after the debut in 1995, spawning a whole series of platformer games as well as several spin-offs.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most acclaimed of all installments was also the latest in the mainline series: <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-legends-is-now-free-on-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rayman Legends</a>, which launched in 2013. Since then, though, fans have been wondering whether the iconic Ubisoft mascot would ever return.</p>
<p>It seems like that's happening after all. Internet sleuths have spotted Ubisoft Milan recruiting for a triple-A game set in the IP:</p>
<p><em>Ubisoft Milan <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000058351278-senior-game-designer-rayman-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is looking for a Senior Game Designer</a> who will work on the Rayman brand. The ideal candidate has a proven and solid experience as a Game Designer in the videogame industry with in-depth understanding of how to define, prototype, and implement game systems within the scope of the project and following the Game direction, making sure to capture the gameplay feel, while still being fun and accessible. A strong UX sensibility or professional experience is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em>Ubisoft Milan <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000060046042-3d-gameplay-animator-rayman-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is seeking a talented 3D Gameplay Animator</a> to be involved in the production of a prestigious AAA title for the Rayman brand. You will be responsible for ensuring the quality and content of gameplay animation assets align with the game's vision.</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft Milan is mostly known for Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope<span>, the latter&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-rayman-dlc-boss-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of which featured Rayman</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-rayman-dlc-boss-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;in a DLC</a>.</p>
<p>The job recruitment follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-remake-prince-of-persia-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an earlier rumor by Insider Gaming</a> that Ubisoft Milan is developing a remake of Rayman. As such, it's probably a good idea to expect one of the older games remade for the current generation of hardware rather than a brand new title.</p>

			<p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1924835210048290843?t=zXn4Aad3lnqWCuPYQjFefA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Tom Henderson</a>, Ubisoft is preparing to release a Director's Cut of one of its big titles, which could be Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p>
<p>The game launched in December 2023 after over six years of development at Ubisoft Massive. The reception wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned</a> a 7.5/10 review score from Wccftech reviewer Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a remarkable achievement in many ways, bringing a cinematic world to life on a massive, technically impressive scale like few games have done before. Unfortunately, limited, frustrating combat means the game isn’t always that fun to play once you bump into the RDA. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora’s world is worth experiencing if you’re a fan of James Cameron’s movies, but as the franchise often reminds us, sky people ruin beautiful things.</em></p>
<p>More importantly, it didn't sell as much as Ubisoft was hoping for, especially when accounting for the huge IP it is based on. However, Ubisoft Massive continued to support it after the launch with new features and content such as the two premium DLCs: <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sky Breaker</a> and Secrets of the Spires. Here's an overview of the latter, which launched around six months ago:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Explore and discover a fresh open world, built to elevate the thrill of flying on your banshee.</em></li>
<li><em>Sabotage RDA aerial convoys with new banshee skills and a brand-new mounted weapon.</em></li>
<li><em>Meet a secluded Na'vi clan and join them in their fight against a new RDA threat ravaging the Spires region.</em></li>
<li><em>Get lost in the verticality of this new region, filled with canyons and caves, where unexpected dangers lurk in the shadows.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A Director's Cut of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora would obviously include both, as well as other core improvements, in all likelihood. Of course, Ubisoft's primary motive for releasing the new version would be to ride the hype of the new movie, Fire and Ash, slated to launch in theaters on December 19, 2025.</p>
