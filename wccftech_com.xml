			<p>Just a few days after the debut of Dying Light: The Beast, and without even needing Techland to share the official mod tools, Nexus Mods already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/dyinglightthebeast/mods?sort=endorsements&amp;excludedTag=Translation&amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosts</a> 121 mods for the first-person open world action gam<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/dyinglightthebeast/mods?sort=endorsements&amp;excludedTag=Translation&amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a>. Some of them actually manage to greatly improve the game in a few key areas. In this article, we'll recommend five in particular.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLTB Retouched</a></strong> - Nexus Mods user aethersquared focused on quality of life enhancements in this mod, which delivers a rework of stamina usage. Its consumption has been slightly reduced and stamina regeneration has been increased. Furthermore, the stamina usage of some combat skills, such as the iconic dropkick, has been halved to encourage a more aggressive playstyle, and the dropkick is also usable in Beast Mode. The main character, Kyle Crane (who returns from the original Dying Light title), now takes longer to get oily/sweaty hands when parkouring. The size of the dot crosshair has been reduced to make it more immersive. The Field of View (FoV) will no longer temporarily increase just when dashing, and you can dash when swimming, making water traversal a bit faster. Lastly, dismantling items is quicker.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/95" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>VAXIS's Dumber Zombies</strong></a> - If you played a little of Dying Light: The Beast, you probably noticed that even regular zombies somehow have a sixth sense when it comes to locating your character, and that's even when you are crouching to be more stealthy. With this mod, their perception is lowered and they will also take longer to recognize you as a threat to attack. This affects only basic zombies, not special zombies.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Zombie Grab Range Reducer</strong></a> - Another gameplay aspect that irked me right away in the game was that every zombie seems capable of grabbing Kyle Crane with ease and even at a fair distance. This mod, created by Fr4nsson, lets you reduce the range from the vanilla 1.7 meters to 1.3 meters, 1.0 meters, or even disable grabbing outright. I wouldn't recommend the latter option, though. Some grabbing makes sense, but only if they really get close.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Better Beast Mode</strong></a> - One of the main additions of this new installment (it's in the title, after all) is a little underwhelming by default, but can get a lot better with this mod by starkillercrane55, which fills up the meter faster, hits enemies faster (while in the mode), increases jump height and makes the grappling hook go faster. Critically, Beast Mode now takes much longer to end without hitting enemies or manually stopping.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More Repairs</a></strong> - As suggested by the title, this mod created by Phobi666 greatly increases the amount of maximum repairs you can perform on an item within a particular rarity. White and green weapons can now be repaired 10 times, blue 20, violet 25, orange 35, and platinum/exotic weapons have infinite repairs. Limited weapons are unaffected.</li>
</ol>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast shines the most when playing in co-op with some friends. As such, there is actually a bonus mod to recommend: Synsteric's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglightthebeast/mods/17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Online with Mods</a>', which disables the multiplayer CRC check to make mods work in co-op mode.</p>

			<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 are doing a lot to fight cheating on PC, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requirement of Secure Boot</a> and Trusted Platform Module (TDM) 2.0. However, nowadays, cheating is an issue even on consoles. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/interview-we-dont-consider-this-a-port-battlefield-6-dev-on-why-it-built-the-ps5-version-concurrently-with-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Push Square</a>, Ripple Effect Technical Director Christian Buhl said they have partnered with Sony and Microsoft to better detect things like Cronus Zen on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, it's unfortunate that cheating has become a problem within the console space, especially with Cronus Zen machines and everything. So we've partnered with PlayStation and both Microsoft in this regard to kind of do detection. We actually have our own level of macro detection and everything.</em></p>



<p><em>So if players are doing rapid with Javelin on the PC side. That's why we've enabled Secure Boot to help us combat the never-ending cheater problem. And we are aware of the console cheater issue, and we're going to be taking cheating very, very seriously here.</em> <em>And we want to preserve as much of the fair play and competitive integrity that we can, because at the end of the day, we want to ensure that you're having a fair competitive space to play Battlefield 6 in.</em></p>



<p>Cronus Zen not only fools games into believing a player is using the gamepad instead of the mouse and keyboard they've actually connected to their consoles, but it also provides access to game scripts and a script compiler, opening the door to many different types of cheats. Needless to say, this could ruin the experience of many players once Battlefield 6 launches on October 10. Here's hoping the collaboration with Sony and Microsoft turns out to be helpful against cheaters.</p>



<p>Ripple Effect also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-secretly-console-first-turn-off-crossplay-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that console players will be able to turn off cross-play with PC, which remains the platform most likely to be affected by cheats.</p>
