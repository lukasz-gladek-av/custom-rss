			<p>The Skywind team has released a new teaser for Halloween 2025. In the footage, which runs for nearly four minutes, we get a glimpse at the spooky side of Vvardenfell, such as skeletons, ghosts, and demons, or more accurately, Daedra and followers of the Daedric princes. </p>



<p>The teaser is narrated by the following voice actors: Dom “Hentus” Tromans, Harry Frost, Anna Pluta, Kit Cambridge, James Cattle, Sara Dunham, CommanderXander, MoonWorks, Ryan Cooper, Argyle, and LacunaFish. However, do note that the voiced lines were created specifically for this teaser and will not be found in the game.</p>



<p>Skywind, a fan-made remake of 2002's The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in the engine of 2011's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, has actually been in the works for even longer than Skyrim itself has been available. That's because it started as a port of the original The Elder Scrolls Renewal project called Morroblivion, which sought to bring Morrowind to the Oblivion engine. With the release of the Creation Kit on February 7, 2012, the porting began in earnest, and six months later, Skywind had a name and logo. Since then, the project's nature has evolved into a game that will recreate every asset, from textures to meshes to sounds.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-total-conversion-mod-gets-call-of-the-east-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first covered it</a> back in 2019. Recently, the team has been more active, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-new-gameplay-demo-and-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showing off a gameplay demo in late May</a>. In early September, for this year's Creation Mod Con, the developers of Skywind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRp7aIoGpak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streamed about an hour of the game</a> while talking about it. There, we learned that every NPC in Morrowind now has a voice actor cast. Recording and editing are still ongoing, but the milestone guarantees all roles will have lines.</p>



<p>Progress has been made when it comes to ambient audio, too, with fuller voice lines and more complex background chatter, making Vvardenfell's towns feel more alive. New houses and expanded houses will ensure that every Skywind NPC with a daily routine has somewhere to sleep, unlike in the original game. Work is also still ongoing on environmental art, with unique ruins and custom murals confirmed to be planned.</p>



<p>The team did not comment on the completion status of the remake project. They only said that experienced volunteers are still needed to work on 3D clothing modeling, audio mastering, SFX, VFX QA, and animation. Moreover, volunteers without prior modding experience can assist with file cutting. To apply, <a href="https://tesrskywind.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head to the official website</a>.</p>



<p>There's no telling when Skywind will be completed, unlike its sister project, Skyblivion, which is technically still scheduled to launch in 2025 (although delays can always occur).</p>
