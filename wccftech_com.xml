			<p>Over the years and with plenty of solid work, developer Cyanide established the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/">Styx </a>series as one of the most important stealth series still running today, combining a dark fantasy medieval world with a personable main character and some advanced gameplay mechanics to provide experiences like few others. The hardcore approach of the franchise will be turned up to eleven by Styx: Blades of Greed, which is setting out to become the biggest and most complex entry in the series to date.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month, I had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed in one of the longest session I had booked for this year's show, and, after a brief presentation, it was clear why I was given one hour and half to try out the game. Not counting the sheer size of the open map, which was really massive, featuring a focus on verticality that only opens a lot of possibilities, but also made it feel even bigger, Styx: Blades of Greed is a game that doesn't pull any punches. Though there was a bit of clunkiness to the experience, with some rather complex controls that required a little time to get used to, and enemies sometimes failing to spot Styx even though he was in plain view ahead of them, the experience was as hardcore as it could have been.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed is as hardcore as a stealth game can get.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not counting the above issues, which will likely get ironed out by the time the game comes out, enemies are highly attentive to their surroundings, forcing the player to take advantage of every hiding point or shadow in the environment, and are relentless in their pursuit of Styx if he is discovered, giving up the search only when the goblin is properly concealed, and out of the way. As Styx is not very good at direct combat, a stealthy approach is always the winning one in Styx: Blades of Greed, forcing players to think hard and proceed even more carefully, and to make them take full advantage of the environment by snuffing out candles to create shadows, where he is more difficult to spot, by making noise to distract enemies, or by simply choosing a safer route with fewer enemies. Thanks to a waypoint system, the general area where the main objective is located is easily highlighted, making it easier for players to focus on sneaking around without having to worry about getting lost.</p>



<p>Besides Styx's excellent agility, which allows him to climb pretty much anywhere to take advantage of the aforementioned improved verticality of the maps, the goblin also has many different abilities that can be learned via skill trees. These abilities were extremely varied in the Gamescom demo, ranging from creating clones to fight and distract enemies, setting down a coccoon to be used as a respawn and teleportation point, mind control, and more. These abilities further highlighted how this sandbox approach to level design is a great direction to take the series to, as the massive freedom left to players makes it very involving and engaging. With other tools added to the mix, like a grappling hook and a glider, it will really be interesting to see how stealth game experts will put everything at Styx's disposal to use.</p>



<p>Though a little complex at times, the Styx: Blades of Greed Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the third entry in the series will elevate the franchise to new heights. With the abilities and tools on show being so diverse and versatile, I'm really interested to see what else the game will offer when it launches this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Excitement and hype have been building around Hollow Knight Silksong's release <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">for years</a>, so it was no surprise when its launch, which occurred 11 days ago at the time of this writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">was a big deal</a>. Several <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">indie games delayed their launches to get out of Silksong's way</a> to try to avoid every ounce of attention being swallowed by Silksong, but others, like Hell is Us, stuck it out, proudly launching alongside Silksong on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Now that both games are out, and developer Rogue Factor survived the first week and a half of launching alongside Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel, Hell is Us director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête had a few thoughts on how Team Cherry handled launching the most wishlisted game on Steam.</p>



<p>"<em>I mean, they're allowed to do what they did,</em>" began Jacques-Belletête when answering what it was like finding out they'd be releasing the same day as Silksong on an episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y">Friends Per Second</a> podcast per <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/">TWIV</a>. "<em>There's no laws or rules against that. And I don't want to get into, 'Oh they caused this to us or somebody else.' I don't really care about that, and I don't want to get into that type of debate. But I do, it's hard for me not to say, like, when you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like wow. You know what I mean? As the GTA VI of indie, right? And I know now this term gets thrown around left and right, but people in the industry, that's how we were</em> <em>calling such a game. To shadow drop something like this is a little callous.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="'Hell is Us' Game Director on what worked (and didn't) | Friends Per Second Ep #78" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/opeNl55y-0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jacques-Belletête also confirmed that there were conversations between Rogue Factor and its publisher, Nacon, regarding whether Hell is Us should be delayed, and that while it wasn't the deciding factor, at least one point of friction against that decision would be having to refund pre-orders, and hope those players purchase them again for the new date.</p>



<p>"<em>The real pain in the ass is that you have to refund your pre-orders when you do that, right? That's the real, 'How you gonna do this?' now you need to rebuild them. We didn't say 'Oh my god, we have to do it but we can't because of that.' We were like, 'No, I think we can get through the storm.'"</em></p>



<p>Obviously, Hell is Us kept its date, which Jacques-Belletête says he was "<em>happy</em>" about, and noted that Rogue Factor is still a larger studio than several of the other indies that delayed their games, which went into the team believing they could weather the storm of Silksong.</p>



<p>But while he doesn't have any hard numbers, it's his belief that Silksong did impact the launch sales of Hell is Us. "<em>I don't have any specific numbers, at least not at this time. But for sure it did</em>." He continued to say that it's not just about Hollow Knight, but about how it's practically impossible to find a release window where you aren't going up against a big upcoming title.</p>



<p>"<em>That's the thing nowadays, getting a window where you're pretty much alone</em> <em>is almost impossible. 15 years ago, the mid-end of the summer was always a dead period. But there's no such thing anymore. It's just constant madness</em>."</p>



<p>When we start looking at sales reports for September, it'll be interesting to see where Hell is Us lands on the charts, especially if it lands within a few places of Silksong. As Jacques-Belletête pointed out, there are no laws against what Team Cherry did, and it's difficult for everyone in the industry, no matter who you are, to draw the ever-shrinking attention spans of modern players away from the hundreds of other options they have to any one game. But it seems odd to even suggest that Team Cherry, or any other studio in its place, owes other studios the courtesy of a long lead time. </p>



<p>Team Cherry launched Hollow Knight Silksong in the way that it did with the intention of getting as many eyes as possible on it for September 4. Rogue Factor did the same with its own strategy. Is that callousness, or competitiveness?</p>



<p>For more on Hell is Us,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/"> you can check out my review</a>, in which I noted that despite a few flaws, Rogue Factor is largely able to succeed at what it is trying to do with Hell is Us, and that it is overall "<em>one of the 2025's best games</em>."</p>
