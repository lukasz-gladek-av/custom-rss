			<p>Amidst the veritable sea of announcements (<a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samson</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hello-sunshine-preview-you-the-desert-and-your-giant-robot-best-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intriguing-sci-fi-first-person-bullet-hell-game-luna-abyss-gets-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna Abyss</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-shown-in-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of War IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/survival-pirate-adventure-game-crosswind-gets-rebranded-to-windrose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crosswind/Windrose</a>, to name a few) from the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase, SOL Shogunate certainly stood out among the most impressive.</p>



<p>Small independent developer Chaos Manufacturing reimagines the sci-fi genre in samurai fashion. In this 'space opera action RPG', a powerful shogunate rules a colonized solar system. However, it's about to be challenged by protagonist Yuzuki, the broken heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. With no choice left but to become an outlaw ronin, Yuzuki seeks to carve a bloody path of vengeance with a traditional ronin arsenal reforged for the battlefields of the future. As the game unfolds, new abilities and skill combinations are unlocked, enabling evolving tactics against increasingly challenging foes.</p>



<p>Yuzuki will explore the so-called Lunar Glass cities of SOL Shogunate, where artificial gravity and simulated night-time provide an Earth-like experience for the Moon's inhabitants, who also enjoy infrastructural wonders such as space elevators and high-speed rails. But beneath the bright skylines and opulent districts of the wealthy lie sprawling industrial zones where workers toil unseen to sustain the shogunate's pervasive influence.</p>



<p>According to the people behind SOL Shogunate, each metropolis on the Moon draws inspiration from a different era of Japanese history. To navigate these vertical districts, players must use gravity-assist gear. They will also uncover hidden layers within each biome and discover clues that unlock the mysteries of the game's backstory.</p>



<p>The developers at Chaos Manufacturing have designed combat to be all about precision, timing, and adaptability. Yuzuki is meant to feel like the ultimate space samurai, albeit genetically modified for the future of combat. Players will get to choose between various weapon types and can channel different types of energy into attacks to expose weaknesses, stagger foes, and create new tactical opportunities. As Yuzuki's abilities grow and her enhancements, like bio-ceramic skin and enhanced vision, evolve, new techniques shift how battles flow and how players overcome increasingly dangerous enemies.</p>

<p>The pinnacle of combat encounters are, of course, the boss fights. The studio promises dynamic, cinematic, multi-phase boss encounters that challenge players to identify and exploit weaknesses. Meanwhile, the music changes as battles intensify, featuring dynamic tracks hand-crafted for the game by talented recording artists, including Japanese rock band AliA.</p>



<p>SOL Shogunate is still in early development, but we already know the game will be released on PC and consoles. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> also lists the surprisingly low system requirements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Liquid Swords, a Swedish developer founded in 2020 by ex Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg, has unveiled their debut game, Samson: A Tyndalston Story, during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase.</p>



<p>About a year ago, the studio had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> the photorealistic visuals of its Unreal Engine 5 open world game. Now, we have received a lot more details. According to the developer, it's going to be a gritty, brutal story.</p>



<p>The protagonist, Samson McCray, is forced to return to the unforgiving streets of the titular city of Tyndalston. He owes some very, very dangerous people a lot of money, and to make sure he returns to pay his debt, these criminals are threatening Samson's sister.</p>



<p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story is based on the simple, yet brutal truth that time is against the protagonist. With every passing day, the debt owed grows with interest. Each job picked by the main character uses up a limited supply of Action Points, and every decision affects how the city treats him, with no do-overs possible. Samson must keep moving forward because standing still makes everything worse.</p>



<p>While one of the features listed is indeed 'open world districts', this is not the type of near-endless open world game where you can stop to explore every nook and cranny without any repercussions. It's a focused story, likely not even too long given that the recommended price is $24.99. Over the course of the narrative, players will learn what broke Samson's family and what it takes to fix it before time runs out.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, Liquid Swords has prepared several systems that will cause Tyndalston to react to what Samson is doing. The police, for example, will push back if the protagonist sows too much chaos on the streets. Moreover, faces, factions, and streets shift in response to Samson's actions.</p>



<p>As you can see in the trailer, fights look very grounded. On-foot combat appears to be focused on brawling, with Samson using momentum, terrain, and improvised tools to take them down. But there's also car combat, with high-speed chases easily turning into collisions, traps, and close-quarters destruction.</p>



<p>The developers also confirmed that Samson: A Tyndalston Story includes a skill tree with over 25 upgrades to shape the main character into the type of fighter preferred by the player.</p>



<p>The game will launch on PC (no other platforms have been confirmed at this time) via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/samson-ab5af7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. It shouldn't be far off, either, with Liquid Swords promising an early 2026 release. </p>



<p>The Epic Games Store already lists the minimum and recommended requirements, although they are oddly missing the CPU:</p>
