			<p>Officially, we don't have a concrete idea of what the next generation of console hardware will look like from either PlayStation or Xbox. Unofficially, at least on the Xbox side of things, we're seeing plenty of hints that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">what's in store for the next-gen Xbox is a sort of PC/console hybrid</a>, a device that will try to take the flexibility of PC when it comes to having your <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rumored-to-be-testing-steam-integration-within-microsoft-store-potentially-for-next-gen-xbox-too/">gaming library from multiple launchers and digital stores available,</a> with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">ease-of-use that comes with a console</a>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-preparing-for-next-gen-with-a-ton-of-new-xbox-gdk-dev-features-heres-whats-new">Windows Central</a>, the new features added to the Xbox Game Development Kit (Xbox GDK) point to Microsoft and Xbox preparing for that rumored future device, with a few standout features which, if you think about how developers and players would use them, you'd end up asking yourself, 'why add this feature if not to prepare for a future where the next Xbox is essentially a PC?'</p>



<p>A nearly 10-minute video from the Microsoft Game Dev YouTube channel goes into great detail on the key features in the October 2025 GDK update, which you can check out below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Some of the key features highlighted in the video include PlayFab Game Saves, which is a feature that lets players access their game save files between Xbox and Steam. Yes, individual games already support cross-progression between PC and consoles, but those all use their own individual systems. This is closer to an extension of Xbox's Cloud Save solution, but including game saves from Steam as well, with plans to add more platforms in the future.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Package Manager is another noteworthy feature, because it is intended to help developers streamline the process for supporting Microsoft's Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, which is a key element to Xbox expanding its reach to let players play their games where they want, whether through Cloud Gaming, PC, console, or PC handheld devices like the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>.</p>



<p>Another new feature, Cross-Platform Gaming Runtime, is specifically meant to make it easier for developers to let players send game invites through Xbox's social features while playing games on other platforms. Essentially, letting someone on Steam send you an invite through your Xbox invites. Lastly, GameInput is a feature intended to unify controller models from your controller, keyboard and mouse under one interface, and featuring full parity with PC. </p>



<p>Again, none of this necessarily confirms that the next-gen Xbox will be the PC/console hybrid that's been rumored, but features like PlayFab Game Saves and Cross-Platform Gaming Runtime lead you to wonder why they'd be implemented at all if not for this next-gen Xbox/PC. </p>

			<p>Sony has announced a new type of State of Play event, which will premiere tomorrow, on November 11, 2025. It's called a 'State of Play Japan,' and is set to specifically feature games coming to PlayStation made by developers in Japan and across Asia. </p>



<p>The event will be 40 minutes long and kick off at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CET, and according to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that revealed the event, it'll feature "<em>beloved series to distinctive indie creations</em>," and be hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, who players might recognize from their work on several anime series including Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, and their work in several video game series including Final Fantasy, Ys, and Fire Emblem.</p>

<p>As it is a live stream event focused on games from Japan and across Asia, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStationJapan">PlayStation Japan YouTube channel</a> will feature a full Japanese-speaking live stream. If you want to follow along but don't speak Japanese, you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation/featured">watch a version with English subtitles on the main PlayStation YouTube channel</a>.</p>



<p>Unlike previous State of Play events, there hasn't been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/">a long, stretched-out rumor cycle</a> leaking the event and what will be shown, so most of what we see tomorrow will be a surprise. That said, there are definitely a few games that come to mind that we could see tomorrow.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet, for example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/">is out on PS5 and PC later this week</a>, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see it appear at this event as a final marketing push. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls from Arc System Work</a>s is another game that could very likely be shown off here, as we've seen a couple of gameplay trailers by now, and it was playable at EVO 2025. We might finally get a proper release date for it at tomorrow's event, even if it might not arrive in 2025.</p>



<p>And if it doesn't arrive in 2025, then that might also be because it'll arrive alongside PlayStation's new fighting stick accessory, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike, which is due out in 2026</a>. It's a good bet that whenever Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is ready to release, the FlexStrike will not be far behind, if it isn't already out, or even launching on the same day.</p>
