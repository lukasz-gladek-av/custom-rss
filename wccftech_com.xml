			<p>During my <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-qa-lot-subtleties-to-movement-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025 interview with the developers of Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2</a>, I was able to obtain details on the game's estimated length. According to Design Director Jey Hicks, there's quite a bit of side content:  </p>



<p><strong><em>Jey Hicks:</em></strong> <em>I can't say the exact numbers because right now we're trying to figure out exactly how long it is, because we've been adding in a bunch of new content recently, but currently our estimates are between people who are a fast player who doesn't do any of the additional content, maybe 20-25 odd hours and then up to potentially around 40 hours for more sort of completionists.</em></p>



<p>My conversation with the folks from The Chinese Room also revealed that Fabien, the Malkavian vampire stuck in Phyre's head, wasn't really playable until a couple of years ago. It was a decision that made Bloodlines 2 much better, according to Hicks and Narrative Director Ian Thomas.</p>



<p><em><strong>Ian Thomas:</strong> We did quite a big change later on, we had a lot of extra story we wanted to tell and we also wanted to introduce the Malkavian clan. Suddenly we went, what if the Malkavian was the character in Phyre's head? Suddenly, it really started to work, and we found that having the old vampire who has maybe lost their humanity to quite a big extent and doesn't connect to the humans, along with Fabian, who's fascinated by humans and is really interested in how the world work, it was a really nice pairing, and that just worked for us, along with a really good voice actor. Suddenly, Fabian was brought to life and they went okay, this is the right way to go. It's quite a late change and also a brave change, I think, from Paradox's case, because they said, yes, you're right. We do need to make this change, let's take the time to do it. We are very happy with that.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Jey Hicks:</strong> I think it was definitely a worthwhile decision to delay the game and make sure that people actually relate and enjoy the characters. We didn't want Fabian to be just another voice in your head sort of character.</em></p>



<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will launch on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Read my recent hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-qa-lot-subtleties-to-movement-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

			<p>The Xbox next-generation system could cost significantly more than the PlayStation 6 due to the Magnus APU and the potential support of third-party stores that would deprive Microsoft of the 30% cut on every game sold on the system.</p>



<p>Commenting on the next-generation system on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 reiterated that the leaked AMD Magnus APU will power<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-dockable-handheld-leak-amd-canis-specs-crush-xbox-ally-x.1687683/#post-270751455"> both the console and a line of gaming PCs</a>, adding that, contrary to speculation, only the console will support backward compatibility with previous-generation Xbox games, mostly due to <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-dockable-handheld-leak-amd-canis-specs-crush-xbox-ally-x.1687683/#post-270751551">publishers not being okay with an Xbox game license getting turned into a PC game license</a>. Outside of a legal grey area of a potential Xbox/Windows dual boot, Microsoft will likely have no way to get Xbox backward compatible games on PC. </p>



<p>On the other hand, the Xbox next-generation system <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-dockable-handheld-leak-amd-canis-specs-crush-xbox-ally-x.1687683/#post-270751551">supporting Steam and GOG games</a> shouldn't have legal issues, and should be feasible on a technical level by running the game inside a virtual machine. However, supporting third-party stores on the system will likely cause the price of the console to be significantly higher than the PlayStation 6, possibly around double, as Microsoft will need to sell the system at a profit without the 30% cut on every game sold on the system and with the added cost of the Magnus APU, which is reportedly a very large APU.</p>



<p>Though obviously unconfirmed, the Xbox next-generation system costing more than the PlayStation 6 is becoming less surprising, especially after the first details on the AMD Magnus APU <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">leaked online</a>. This big APU with a chiplet design will provide Microsoft with a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">flexibility to produce a wide range of systems</a> that will likely compete with pre-built gaming PCs rather than other consoles like the PlayStation 6 and Nintendo Switch 2. Sony, on the other hand, is reportedly heading towards a different direction aimed at delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">4K, 120 FPS capable system with significant ray tracing performance uplifts</a> while keeping costs down, alongside a portable system which is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">easily outperform the Xbox ROG Ally X and even the base PlayStation 5 </a>with games patched to take advantage of the console's capabilities. As such, with these diverse approaches, the next generation of consoles promises to be one of the most interesting in years.</p>

			<p>A look at future Kojima Productions games will be provided later this month during the studio's 10th anniversary celebrations.</p>



<p>As revealed today on the Japanese development studio's <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/kjp10th_beyond_the_strand">official website</a>, a special event called Beyond The Strand will take place at TOHO Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Tokyo on September 23. The event will celebrate the development studio's 10th anniversary and feature special guest appearances as well as a glimpse into future projects. Tickets for the event will go on <a href="https://l-tike.com/cinema/mevent/?mid=763198">sale</a> tomorrow, September 2, at 10:00 AM JST and will only be available via advanced reservation. Live stream details will be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>Though we haven't seen much of what Kojima Productions is currently working on, we know the development studio headed by Hideo Kojima is working on the OD project with Microsoft and on Physint in collaboration with Sony. Following a slew of cancelled projects at Microsoft, the future of OD seemed uncertain, but it was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/">confirmed</a> that development would continue on a project that will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/">very different from anything else on the market and quite divisive</a>. Physint, on the other hand, seems to be very far from release, as the game that will bring back Hideo Kojima to the stealth genre is still in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojimas-physint-conceptual-phase/">conceptual phase.</a></p>



<p>Kojima Productions' latest game is Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Released in June on PlayStation 5, the second entry in the series is a much more cohesive package than its predecessor and the culmination of some of Hideo Kojima's best and worst ideas, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review.</a></p>
