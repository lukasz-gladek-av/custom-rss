			<p>When Rockstar announced that Grand Theft Auto VI would <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">no longer be launching in 2025 and was instead pushed back to 2026</a>, it was a disappointing day for plenty of players, even though we all got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-2-breaks-all-time-24h-viewership-records-beating-deadpool-vs-wolverine/">nice trailer to pore over in the meantime</a>. A disappointing day for those hoping to play it as soon as possible though, was a day of celebration for developers across the industry planning to release a game in fall 2025, including for Ghost of Yotei developer, Sucker Punch. </p>



<p>In a recent rapid-fire interview with MinnMax, creative director at Sucker Punch, Nate Fox, was asked, "<em>When GTA VI was delayed into 2026, did the entire studio just like pop some champagne?," </em>to which Fox replied, "<em>We're all still hungover. Multi-month hangover. That was a great day," </em>with a sizeable smile on his face as he said it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Ghost of Yotei might have avoided having to go toe-to-toe with Grand Theft Auto VI when its launch arrives this coming October, any games planning to launch in May 2026 won't be so lucky, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-very-high-conviction-grand-theft-auto-vi-wont-be-delayed-again-rockstar/">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has a "<em>very, very, high</em>" conviction </a>that the game's release date won't be moved again.</p>



<p>Sucker Punch recently confirmed that Ghost of Yotei had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-already-gone-gold/">"<em>gone gold</em>"</a> ahead of its coming launch, and  PlayStation fans can look forward to its release on October 2, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-4-support-is-coming-in-first-quarter-of-2026-%E2%80%93-rumor.1292694/</guid>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4</a> support will come to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5-pro/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> early next year, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>In a new video shared a few days ago on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> commented on when support for the new version of the AMD upscaling tech is expected to hit the system, saying that it should come in the first quarter of 2026, together with or shortly after support for RDNA 3 GPUs, which may come as early as in the final months of 2025.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RX 9070 GRE 16GB Specs Leak, AMD FSR 4 on RDNA 3, Nvidia RTX 5080 &amp; 5070 SUPER | August Loose Ends" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HEdT4lCvWaY?start=462&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although Moore's Law is Dead proved reliable regarding PlayStation leaks in the past few months being the first to reveal the AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, we have to take what was revealed in the video above with a pinch of salt. Lead System Architect Mark Cerny confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr4-ps5-pro-2026-rdna5/">AMD FSR 4 support is indeed coming to PlayStation 5 Pro sometime in 2026</a>, however, so there's a very good chance that it is indeed coming in the first few months of the year as MLiD revealed.</p>



<p>While it is official that AMD FSR 4 is coming to PlayStation 5 Pro next year, very little is known about how the system will handle the upscaler and how games will benefit from some of its features, which include AI-powered super resolution and frame generation. Known AMD insider KeplerL2 revealed back in July that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-can-t-run-amd-fsr-4-ai-model/">the system is not capable of running the same model used on RDNA 4 GPUs</a>, as the console lacks FP8 support, meaning that some work will have to be done for the console to run the full version of the tech. In addition, it seems like existing games will have to be patched, as the current version of PSSR doesn't allow system-level DLL swaps.</p>



<p>Even without AMD FSR 4 and with the sometimes average implementation of the PSSR upscaler, the PlayStation 5 Pro is still a worthy purchase for demanding console games that want to experience PlayStation 5 games at the very best.

			<p>Dead Reset is the latest and 17th FMV game from Wales Interactive, a studio that has done just FMV titles, but it’s a well the studio draws from, more than it does from making more roguelike deckbuilders, survival FPS games, 2.5D auto-attack survival games, and VR titles, to name just a few of the ways the studio bounces around.</p>



<p>Not only is Dead Reset not the studio’s first time making an FMV game, but it’s also not the first time it’s done a horror-flavored FMV game. This is all to say that I have to believe Wales Interactive knows a thing or two about developing and executing on full-motion-video, or FMV, narratives. Or, that they’ve proven 16 times over now, they can make one successful enough to make another.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole backs up against a desk while hiding from the creature</figcaption></figure>



<p>I haven’t played their other FMV games, but I can believe that what was learned from them is what informs the best parts of Dead Reset. It’s a tightly paced story with strong performances that keep you locked into playing to find out what happens next. Scenes are tense, emotionally charged, and there’s enough atmosphere created through strong lighting and sound choices to carry the parts that aren’t as strong, like the over-the-top gore and messy creature design that hams everything up, or how, even if the actors are doing their best with the writing, the words they're told to say make them sound like a bad caricature.</p>



<p>When I checked out the first chapter of Dead Reset in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-reset-hands-on-preview/">preview</a>, I came away disappointed, though that was mostly due to my own expectations not being met. I was hoping it would be more of a layered horror story, but it seemed more interested in trying to do a fun creature-feature to play through with a bowl of popcorn at your side. I’m all for that experience too, and when I had still only played the first chapter, I was hopeful Dead Reset would get better as it went along.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, now that I’ve seen every chapter multiple times, I feel let down again, knowing that Dead Reset doesn’t have the juice to be entertaining the whole way through.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole chooses between admitting his déjà vu and not.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What I mean by ‘the whole way through’ is getting to each of the four endings, because otherwise you can mop it up in less than three hours, and feel totally fine with whatever version of the story you got (unless you got the worst one). Play through it just the once, and you’ll probably walk away perfectly whelmed and reasonably entertained. It’s when you ‘reset’ your experience that suddenly, the plot beats I liked the first time around didn’t hit as hard, even with a new context between each character as I tried to make different choices each time. It quickly started to feel more like checking scenes off for the sole purpose of saying you’ve seen them and whatever alternatives they offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some basics about Dead Reset. You play as Cole Mason, a former surgeon who can remember how to perform surgery, but not anything about what happened to him before a security guard named Slade picks him up and tosses him in front of a patient who has a ‘foreign mass’ in her lower abdomen. There are six core characters: Cole, Fearne, Weir, Cooper, Slade, and Magson.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>Even in its earliest forms, the creature looks like a mess of bad looking prosthetics.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The mass is a creature that eats anything with a pulse and looks like someone made a mop out of intestines. It changes forms, but it unfortunately never really looks scary or even interesting, to be frank. In every form, it looks like a blob of flesh put together from the scrap pile of a prop studio’s prosthetics section. It’s even telling that you so rarely get a solid, long look at the creature, with most of the shots featuring it only showing a half-view, or a dimmed view while the lights only partially illuminate it. Almost like the production team knew it wasn’t worth highlighting.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You'll hear Cooper scream quite a bit depending on how many wrong turns you take.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the creature isn’t interesting, what’s at least a little more fun to think about is the ability, or curse, depending on how you see it, that Cole bears. He's stuck in a time loop, with his starting point being determined by a power surge connected to a time machine chair that the Magson character has built, and his reset point being any time he dies. With each new power surge, his starting point moves forward in time, which is how you progress through the story.</p>



<p>There’s a menu that tracks how many of its 339 scenes you’ve witnessed, how many times you’ve died across all your playthroughs, how many of the endings you’ve found, and how many decisions you’ve made. There’s another that claims to track your relationships with the other characters, though it never seemed to give me any more information beyond who was still alive among the five characters you meet alongside Cole.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dead Reset features plenty of scenes enhanced by its lighting and sound design choices.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s also a page that tracks different ‘tasks’ or objectives you can try to complete based on what paths you’ve taken. It’s all very bare bones and is only a little helpful for anyone wanting to do some achievement hunting.</p>



<p>Speaking of the choices you make, you can either have them countdown, or you can set it to 'Streamer Mode,' which pauses the action and lets you take however long you like to decide. Some of the choices, you realize, are meaningless. Plenty of them just pad out the experience so that Cole has the necessary information to move forward. Once you've played through to the end once, it's easy to spot which do and don't matter, another element that adds to the tedium of playing it a second, third, and fourth time to see all the endings.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Cole, Fearne, and Slade all get the most screen time.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that there is a meta-layer of fun to be had for veteran horror fans. If you're someone who loves the horror genre, and has seen all of its sides from the most intense to the most laid-back, comedy-focused stories and everything in between, then you can have a good time doing what I did on my first playthrough. Basically, with every choice I ran through all the horror and narrative tropes the genre carries in my head, and decided based on what I've always believed characters in other horrors should have done, instead of making bad, emotional decisions. As if I had a '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HowItShouldHaveEnded">How It Should Have Ended</a>' storyboard running through my head in real-time for Dead Reset. It was fun, and more than a little funny, how often it worked. Randy Meeks would've probably mopped up the whole game without dying unnecessarily once.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, I'm walking away from my time with Dead Reset more disappointed than when I previewed it. At least then I had hope, because I hadn't played the full game. The naked truth of it is that despite good performances from the whole cast, some wonderful lighting and sound design work, well-paced scenes that kept the story moving with strong emotional beats at the wheel, it doesn't hold up on multiple replays. </p>



<p>It's not helped by the fact that when it's not dimly lit with the darkness of a secret research station (and even sometimes when it is), the set looks like it came out of a forgettable Doctor Who episode, while the creature looks like a mish-mash of rejected creature designs that came together the way it did because they ran out of time to do any better. The rest of its gore and prosthetic work subtract from the experience rather than add to it, cutting the intensity too much compared to how straight and serious the rest of the story is played. If there were more jokes made, then maybe it would've made sense. Instead, it just makes you laugh when you're supposed to be scared.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Dead Reset is worth experiencing for its performances, its tense atmosphere built on strong lighting and sound design choices, and well-paced story that makes you want to keep finding out what will happen next, but its entertainment value wanes after you've hit the credits. It's less enticing on replays or 'resets,' and its worst attributes don't help carry the experience beyond a single play through.</p>
