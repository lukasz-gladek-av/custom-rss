			<p>Sony has launched a lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement against Tencent over what it calls a "<em>slavish clone</em>" of its Horizon game series, Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram was first announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">November 2024</a>, and it was immediately obvious to anyone even remotely familiar with the Horizon series that Motiram was at the very least drawing inspiration from Horizon, and that's being extremely generous with the comparisons. Being more appropriate and less generous, Motiram looked like a flat-out copy-paste job with a few changes in details and a new name.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Tencent debuted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/">gameplay trailer for Light of Motiram</a>, which did very little to show that Motiram was its own unique game compared to Horizon. Now, a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/">Reuters</a> reveals that Sony was paying attention to Light of Motiram, and to how media pegged it as a Horizon copy. According to Reuters report, Sony's complaint includes how the media described it as a "<em>knock-off</em>," even including the phrase "<em>Horizon Zero Originality</em>."</p>



<p>We, as outsiders looking at Light of Motiram, might have seen it as a copycat of Horizon, but that's ultimately a public opinion. Proving it in court is a different matter entirely, as Nintendo is finding out with its attempt at suing <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">Palworld makers PocketPair</a>. Needless to say, it'll be interesting to see how the case goes, and the kind of precedent it sets for the future of the industry.</p>

			<p>One of PlayStation's announcements during its Summer Game Fest-timed State of Play was the introduction of a new wireless fight stick from the company, announced at the time under the name "<em><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-project-defiant-a-wireless-fight-stick-for-ps5-and-pc/">Project Defiant</a></em>." Today, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/28/new-details-on-playstations-first-wireless-fight-stick-flexstrike/">PlayStation Blog</a> post, the official name for the fight stick, FlexStrike, was revealed, along with a new trailer showcasing its features and the news that it'll be out sometime next year. </p>

<p>"<em>Compatible with PS5 or PC via a wired connection or wirelessly with PlayStation Link, our innovative ultra-low latency wireless technology, FlexStrike wireless fight stick features mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates,"</em> writes Edwin Foo, vice president of product development at Sony. "<em>These include square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that fit into the fight stick’s built-in storage compartments alongside the included PS Link USB adapter."</em></p>



<p>You'll be able to use it wirelessly with a USB-A dongle in the front or back of your PS5 or PC, or use it with a wired USB-C connection. You can have a DualSense controller connected to your PS5 simultaneously with the FlexStrike, to help navigate menus better, and as the trailer shows off, its wireless connection is Sony's new PlayStation Link, which is how all its most recent wireless peripherals connect to PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles. </p>



<p>It'll be at EVO 2025, but if you're at the event, you won't be able to try it. PlayStation says it'll be there "<em>on display only</em>," so you can get a look at it and the carrying case it comes with when visiting the Arc System Works booth. More details on when players will actually be able to get their hands on it will probably arrive closer to its actual release date, sometime in 2026. </p>



<p>PlayStation has had a firm hand in the fighting game community for years, but this is the first time it is making its own fight stick for players to use. Whenever players do get their hands on it, especially the pros that might consider bringing it to EVO, it'll be interesting to see if it can usurp the fight sticks and gamepads they already prefer.</p>
