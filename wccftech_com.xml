            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a new Epic Games Store MEGA sale <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live now</a>, featuring discounts for lots of fun PC games. First things first, though: alongside the discounts, Epic is also bringing back the sale's trademark freebies, starting with the psychedelic indie horror game <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/happy-game-35a105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happy Game</a> and with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dead-island-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Island 2</a>, both of which can be added to your libraries for free until Thursday, May 22 at 5 PM.</p>
<p>Dead Island 2 is, of course, the bigger of the two offerings, having sold 4 million units to date. The project started with Yager Development and then moved to Sumo Digital, but it was Deep Silver Dambuster that eventually brought it over the end of the line in a rather successful fashion. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned a 7.5/10 score from Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Games that go through development hell hardly turn out great, but Dambuster Studio proved with Dead Island 2 that this is not always the case, although the game is far from a masterpiece. While the gameplay works and feels quite fun at the start of the game, things become repetitive very quickly due to the linearity of the experience and the shallowness of the combat system. Offering nothing more than some mindless fun, the game would have been more than fine if launched at a lower price, but at full price, Dead Island 2 doesn't offer that much to justify it.</em></p>
<p>If you don't fancy these games, there's plenty of engaging titles that you can grab at discounts in the Epic Games Store 2025 MEGA sale, and you can even take advantage of boosted Epic Rewards (from 5% to 20%) for all purchases made in the store using Epic's payment system until 31 August. Additionally, when using Epic's payment system, you can get 20% back permanently on Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys purchases.</p>

			<p>After the release date for Stellar Blade on PC was <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-accidentally-reveals-stellar-blades-pc-release-date/">accidentally</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-accidentally-reveals-stellar-blades-pc-release-date/">leaked by PlayStation earlier this week</a>, we now have the official announcement that PC players will be able to help Eve defend Earth on June 11, 2025.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/stellar-blade-launches-june-11-on-pc-specs-and-features-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Shift Up's chief technical officer and Stellar Blade's technical director, DongKi Lee, walks players through the announcement and many of the features PC players will be able to enjoy. Features that were already spoiled by the trailer dropping earlier than it should have this past Monday.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade - PC Features Trailer | PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pex7jW3Tqwo?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What wasn't spoiled by the trailer, however, was the minimum and recommended technical specs for PC players.</p>
<p>For the minimum, average performance of a 1080p resolution at 60fps, with graphics preset to 'Low,' Shift Up says you need to have at least an Intel Core i5-7600K or an AMD Ryzen 5 1600X CPU, paired with either an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or an AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU, and 16GB of RAM.</p>
<p>For a recommended experience of the graphics set to 'Medium,' with Stellar Blade running at a 1440p resolution and 60fps, Shift Up says you should have an Intel Core i5-8400 or an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X CPU, paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super or an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT GPU.</p>
<p>Recommended GPUs are the only change in the chart as the specs move from 'Recommended' to 'Very High.'</p>

			<p>Next-generation Xbox products may be based on the ARM/Snapdragon platform, a new job listing spotted online suggests.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/job-listing-hints-at-next-generation-xbox-to-be-arm-snapdragon-based.1190199/">ResetERA forums</a>, a <a href="https://jobs.abven.com/companies/nuvia/jobs/50821791-director-sales-surface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualcomm job ad</a> for a director of sales that was posted online two days ago mentions that the position will involve supporting the <em>"sell-in activities for the next generation of Surface and Xbox products built on Snapdragon solutions,</em>" suggesting that the ARM/Snapdragon platform will power one or more offerings of the next generation of console by Microsoft. Given how the platform would provide great benefits in terms of power efficiency, it's likely that the yet-to-be-revealed Xbox handheld will be the next generation product that will be based on it, though it could create quite a few problems with compatibility with currently available games built with the x86 architecture that has powers the Xbox One and the Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Xbox-Qualcomm.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Microsoft has yet to officially outline its next-generation plans, although there's no doubt that a handheld system will be part of it, as Xbox head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-once-again-teased-by-phil-spencer/">teased</a> such a system multiple times in the past. According to an earlier report, these <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation Xbox plans</a> include not only this yet-to-be-announced full-fledged handheld but also a successor to the Xbox Series X as well as another <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">handheld gaming system </a>known as Project Kennan in the vein of the Steam Deck that will run Windows and feature an interface reminiscent of Microsoft's other systems. This handheld, which should launch this year, is reportedly being worked on in collaboration with ASUS.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 poised to become another <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">massively successful console</a>, it's not surprising that both Microsoft and Sony are planning to enter, or re-enter, in Sony's case, the handheld market. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">PlayStation 6 handheld system</a> is rumored to be in the works alongside a home system that will be able to run PlayStation 5 games natively, though it won't be as powerful as the current generation console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is pushing its developers back into the office and phasing out its remote work policies, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN</a> reports.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts chief executive officer Andrew Wilson told employees in an email that hybrid work will now mean at least three days in the office, and that the company would not be hiring for any more locally remote roles.</p>
<p>In a separate email, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele clarified that these changes will not take effect immediately and that employees currently working remotely who are being asked back into the office will have a minimum of 12 weeks' notice to make the transition.</p>
<p>EA is also introducing a new 30-mile/48km radius around its offices, which will set the ground rules for what work model employees will fall under. If you live within that radius and currently work remotely, you'll transition to the newly defined hybrid model of three days a week in the office.</p>
<p>If you live outside of that radius, you'll continue to work as you are until EA designates that you have to transition either to a hybrid or an on-site model, the latter meaning you'd have to be in the office five days a week.</p>
<p>A final key change with this push back to in office work is that all future remote work hires and any exemptions to the hybrid or on-site models as they are now defined will have to go through the approval of EA's top executives, which means it'll be up to EA Entertainment president Laura Miele or Andrew Wilson to approve an employee's remote work request.</p>
<p>In Wilson's email, IGN reports he said that working in an office allows for "<em>a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players</em>."</p>
<p>That all sounds wonderful, but game studios proved, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that remote work models can be successful for teams. The pandemic proved even further that the video game industry's biggest studios could be successful with remote work models. It's not like anything Wilson describes is exclusive to working in an office.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, EA employees are not all too happy with the push, and some who anonymously spoke to IGN expressed concerns around whether they'd be able to move closer to the office in the transition period, and how needing to return to the office, even just three days a week, means a complete uprooting of their lives.</p>
<p>These new changes will undoubtedly cause talented developers who, for their own valid reasons, can't make it into an EA office three times a week to leave the company. It's a way of making cuts that doesn't have to involve EA saying they are laying people off, and without having to pay severance to those who are forced to leave due to these changes. EA's balance sheet might be better off in the eyes of Wilson and the company's bean counters, but that gain does not offset the loss of key talent.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA laid off 300-400 developers,</a> 100 of them from Respawn, and canceled another project it was incubating, which was reportedly an extraction shooter set in the world of Titanfall.</p>
