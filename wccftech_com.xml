			<p>PUBG Studios has <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en/news/9005">announced</a> that it will be ending support for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of PUBG, as it moves to only supporting the game on current-generation PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles alongside the PC version. </p>



<p>"<em>As mentioned in our 2025 roadmap, we've been preparing to transition PUBG Console to current-generation consoles,"</em> a statement on the PUBG website reads. "<em>Starting November 13, 2025, PUBG Console will be supported only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</em>."</p>



<p>The studio calls the transition "<em>necessary</em>" as part of its efforts "<em>to provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed PUBG on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years. We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together. We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years. This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console.</em>"</p>



<p>The post goes on to explain that players on PS4 and Xbox One will have their accounts preserved and secure after November 13, 2025, ready for those players when they log back in on a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S device. And thankfully, logging back in is all you'll need to do to pick up your account, with "<em>no separate transfer process required</em>."</p>



<p>PlayStation players will, however, have to download the specific, PS5-native version of PUBG to play the game, since the PS4 version will still appear as a separate app and not be playable.</p>



<p>Once the transition has been made to current-gen platforms, players on PS5 can expect to play PUBG at a base 1440p resolution and 60FPS, while PS5 Pro players will get a full 4K/60FPS experience. On Xbox Series S, both 1080p/60FPS and 1440p/30FPS will be supported, depending on the experience you want, while Xbox Series X players will enjoy a 4K/60FPS experience.</p>
