			<p>Before we saw the official reveal of Resident Evil Requiem during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Summer Game Fest</a> event, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-delayed/">rumors that the next entry into the historically linear franchise would be an open-world game</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we know Resident Evil 9, officially called Resident Evil Requiem, is in fact not an open-world game, and closer to what players expect from the series, it's easy to dismiss those rumors as just that - rumors. Well, according to Capcom, those were not rumors and were indicative of how Requiem began its development journey.</p>
<p>In an extended version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-shows-off-brief-look-at-first-and-third-person-gameplay-as-resident-evil-requiem-takes-players-back-to-raccoon-city/">Resident Evil Requiem Creator's Message video</a> that's only available through the <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/video.html">Resident Evil Portal on Capcom's website</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-reveals-resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-online-game-but-we-realised-fans-didnt-want-it/">VGC</a>), director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed the rumors were true, though Capcom pivoted from its open-world approach after concluding that this wasn't the direction players wanted the series to go in.</p>
<p>"<em>You might have heard some of the</em> <em>rumors</em>," Nakanishi began. "<em>Things like an online Resident Evil or an open-world Resident Evil, which we spent some time experimenting with. But in the end, although we had some interesting concepts, we realized that it wasn't what fans wanted to see or play. So we went back to the drawing board and created what led to Resident Evil Requiem.</em>"</p>
<p>Having the context that those rumors were true, and that Resident Evil 9 was almost an open-world, potentially online-focused game, makes the opening statement from producer Masachika Kawata make a lot of sense, as he begins his section of the Creator's Message video by clarifying that Resident Evil Requiem "<em>is an offline single-player game</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hiC3qpghP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a time when it feels like many of the bigger publishers and developers are trying to push an online focus onto historically offline single-player games, it's nice to hear a story where the team realized early enough that things needed to go in a different direction.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder how different things could have been for other games that we know went through a similar process, like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">EA's leadership kept pushing for Dragon Age to be a live service title</a> and realized far too late in the development of what became Dragon Age: The Veilguard that they had been barking up the wrong tree. And we all know<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/"> how that went</a>.</p>
<p>At least in the case of Resident Evil Requiem, we can look forward to its release next year with plenty of excitement, as Capcom is on a hot-streak of excellent releases. Perhaps that has something to do with their leaders having more than just hollow space and dollar signs in the six inches between their ears.</p>

			<p>It will be a very long time before Borderlands 4 gets a deep discount and hits subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, Randy Pitchford recently said.</p>
<p>Commenting on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938309648320500181" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/">Steam Summer Sale 2025</a> deep discount of the third entry in the series, which is now available for 95% off its full price, the Gearbox CEO highlighted how it took five years for the game to get such a deep discount and become available on gaming subscription services, suggesting players to take advantage of the deal. To set expectations for the future, Randy Pitchford added that it will take much longer for the same to happen for Borderlands 4. Though the Gearbox CEO later clarified his statement, suggesting that it may not be up to him for this to happen, reiterating that he is not <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938408120415621234">involved in pricing and sales,</a> it will be very interesting to see how much this statement will hold in the future.</p>
<p>The longer time it will take for Borderlands 4 to get a deep discount over its predecessor isn't the only thing that will set the two games apart. According to Executive Producer Chris Brock, the new entry in the series will be more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-a-bigger-evolution-than-borderlands-3-says-gearbox/">an evolution</a> for the franchise than its predecessor was, which was designed to be as familiar as possible due to the franchise not having received a new entry in seven years. Traversal abilities and exploration, in particular, will set the new game apart from the rest of the franchise.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will be released later.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-unveils-hexe-marie-boss-fight-in-crimson-desert/">Pearl Abyss</a> is bringing <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert</a> back to Gamescom with another demo available for those in attendance at Gamescom 2025 to try out for themselves ahead of the game's launch sometime this fall.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was playable at <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and before the event, there were rumblings that we'd see the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">launch sometime in early 2025</a>. That didn't happen, of course, with Pearl Abyss announcing a fall 2025 release date at <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>
<p>We nearly had a release date revealed last week, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/">Korean website reporting that Crimson Desert would arrive on November 2, 2025</a>. Pearl Abyss released a statement following the report, simply saying, "<em>When the company is ready to announce a release date, it will come from official channels</em>."</p>
<p>That statement doesn't exactly deny the November 2 date, though, of course, it doesn't confirm it either. We'll have to wait for Pearl Abyss to properly announce the date, which could potentially come at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>If you do check out Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2025, then you'll be playing it on an AMD-powered PC with Samsung G6 and G8 monitors on display. You'll also walk away with a bag of Crimson Desert merchandise, according to a press release from Pearl Abyss.</p>
<p>"<em>We're thrilled to debut Crimson Desert's latest public demo for the very first time here at Gamescom 2025</em>," said chief executive officer of Pearl Abyss Europe, Lybee Park.</p>
<p>"<em>We can't wait for fans to get hands-on with the experience we've crafted. From the immersive booth to the gameplay itself, we hope every visitor walks away feeling part of Crimson Desert - and excited for what's to come at launch</em>."</p>
<p>If you want to run right to the Pearl Abyss booth once you break through the Gamescom doors, you'll be able to find them in the Entertainment Area in Hall 06.1, Stand B041-A040.</p>
