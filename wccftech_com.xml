			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI developer Rockstar is currently being accused of <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">union-busting by the 34 workers it fired and the IWGB (Independent Workers of Great Britain)</a>, and after the story reached UK parliament for a second time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">this time with Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaking on it</a>, Rockstar has released a statement reaffirming its previous claims that the fired employees were dismissed for distributing and discussing confidential information, not because they were part of the union.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">IGN</a>, Rockstar not only reaffirmed its previous claims but also specified the alleged confidential information more than it did before. When Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">initially claimed the employees were dismissed for gross misconduct regarding the alleged leak of confidential information</a>, it stated the employees were "<em>found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p>This time, the new statement specifies that the employees were distributing and discussing confidential information "<em>including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading</em>," the full statement reads.</p>



<p>After Rockstar first made its claim that the employees were leaking confidential information, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">IWGB</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">other union members</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">employees speaking up anonymously</a> have not only refuted these claims, but a recent report points to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">Rockstar allegedly trying to use employees discussing changing Slack policies in a union-members-only Discord server as the breach of confidential information</a> that got the 34 employees fired.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">IWGB has also filed legal claims against Rockstar</a> based on the evidence it is collecting and its accusations of union-busting, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed the government would be investigating the accusations in parliament yesterday, December 10, 2025. </p>



<p>It's also worth remembering that Chris Murray, the MP who brought the issue directly to Starmer during yesterday's parliament also noted that he came to parliament after having spoken to Rockstar, saying that they "<em></em><em>failed to reassure me they are following employment law</em>,<em> and I share concerns about union-busting</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Deus Ex Remastered Delayed Indefinitely, All Pre-Orders Refunded]]></title>

			<p>Aspyr Media has <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572">announced</a> that its upcoming Deus Ex Remastered, a remaster of the original June 2000 game, has been delayed indefinitely. It will no longer release on its previously announced February 5, 2026, date, and Aspyr has refunded all pre-orders of the game.</p>



<p>The decision to delay the game came after feedback from Deus Ex fans based on the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/deus-ex-remastered-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">game's initial reveal this past September</a>, which failed to impress players with its changes to the game's visuals. How a remaster changes the visuals in a retro game is almost always a point of controversy among that game's fan base, and this remaster of Deus Ex is no different.</p>



<p>This time, it seems, that the backlash has been too loud for Aspyr to ignore, as its statement thanks players for their feedback and that this delay is to ensure the studio is able to meet players expectations.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered,</em>" the statement begins. "<em>We've listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on February 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes. All existing pre-orders will be fully refunded. Thank you again for your patience and support</em>."</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Aspyr, this is yet another disappointing result for them after a string of disappointing results. In the last few years, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-launch-mess-3-servers/">Star Wars Battlefront Collection was an absolute mess of a release</a>, Aspyr <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-still-being-worked-on-jason-schreier-says-to-have-heard/">was pulled off the Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, and now this.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the studio can rally and come back with a version of Deus Ex Remastered that gets fans excited to dive into the stealth game that set the blueprint for so many after it. Deus Ex is one of gaming's more important titles when it comes to how influential it was on everything that came after and the immersive sim genre, so it would be incredibly disappointing for a remaster of the title to be anything less than a complete show of respect and love for the original work.</p>
