			<p>All those who purchase the retail edition of DOOM: The Dark Ages on PlayStation 5 will need to download the full game to play it, according to a new report.</p>
<p>As reported today by Polish publication <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/369411/doom-the-dark-ages-z-haczykiem-w-wersji-pudelkowej-na-ps5-uzytkownik-ppe-pl-zdradza-istotny-szczegol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPE</a>, users who managed to get their hands on early physical copies of the new entry in the series by id Software confirmed that the game box indicates that an internet connection is required to play the game, which won't even start without one. This is because the disk includes only a small amount of data, around 400 MB, and, as such, the entire game must be downloaded first. Making matters worse, as highlighted by PPE, is the fact that publisher Bethesda hasn't clarified the matter so close to the game's release next week, other than the complete waste of a disc to only include what presumably are only licenses to launch the digital download of the game.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages promises to ramp up the demon-slaying experience of the series to new heights with new mechanics and elevate it past that of its two immediate predecessors. Our review will be up shortly, but in the meantime, you can learn more about what to expect from the game by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/">preview.</a></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 15th worldwide.</p>

			<p>Killing Floor 3 was initially set to release on March 25, 2025, but the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">delayed</a> with no new release date announced weeks before that initial date. On Friday, Tripwire Interactive finally announced the new release date for <strong>July 24, 2025,</strong> making it a four-month delay.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing the new date, Tripwire Interactive's creative director, Bryan Wynia, marked the "<em>incredible</em>" support the studio has seen from fans of the Killing Floor series, since Tripwire delayed Killing Floor 3 specifically to respond to feedback from the series' community.</p>
<p>It was after a closed beta for Killing Floor 3 that didn't go as well as Tripwire would have wanted, which largely influenced the decision to delay the game another four months. Tripwire noted in its March statement confirming the delay that the feedback from that closed beta made the team realize it had "<em>missed the mark</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3, we've dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community's feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared</em> <em>vision,</em>" Wynia said in today's press release.</p>
<p>"<em>The support from fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we're thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.</em>"</p>
<p>Part of Tripwire's method of responding to community feedback during the delay period has been consistently updating fans on the progress the team made through the game's <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?forums/kf-3-news-announcements.2333661/">official forums</a>. Updates and changes to the UI, design, and artwork have been posted nearly every few days since the delay was announced on March 7, 2025.</p>
