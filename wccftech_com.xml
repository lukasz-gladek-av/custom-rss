			<p>Earlier today, Tom Henderson revealed that Ubisoft is developing a turn-based tactics game set in the world of Rainbow Six Siege. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the report</a>, this game is expected to launch in 2026 or 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and 'possibly' Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Henderson's sources mentioned that it will feel a lot like XCOM, albeit with more cinematic cutscenes and the like. Players will select operators with different skill sets based on the current mission. The campaign is said to last between 25 and 30 hours, though that could change since the development is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been one of the most successful Ubisoft games in the last decade, and it's still being updated, so it's not surprising that the publisher is doubling down on the IP. It was also handpicked alongside Far Cry and Assassin's Creed to be handled separately as part of the new subsidiary that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> recently with the financial help of Tencent.</p>
<p>In a couple of months, Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be overhauled</a> with X, a new version featuring improved graphics and new gameplay elements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>New destructible items</li>
<li>Smoother rappel navigation with improved controls</li>
<li>Revamped audio experience with better propagation and reverberation</li>
<li>Refreshed onboarding experience to help new players master the basics through tutorials and field training before jumping into their matches</li>
<li>A new communication wheel to easily communicate with teammates</li>
<li>An updated Pick and Ban system injects a new layer of strategy by allowing teams to react and adapt to enemy strategies. Simultaneous bans every round will speed up the process</li>
<li>R6 ShieldGuard, a unified approach to all existing anti-cheat initiatives that also introduces new technologies to protect the game, including live security updates that will occur without the need for scheduled maintenance, making it harder to create cheats</li>
<li>An improved reputation system to ensure players behave appropriately during matches</li>
</ul>
