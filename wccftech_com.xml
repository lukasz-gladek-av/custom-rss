			<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC system requirements have been <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_2_remastered_pc_features_new_no_return" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> today, detailing the system requirements for different resolutions and target framerates.</p>
<p>To run the game at low settings, 720p resolution @ 30 frames per second, users won't need a beefy system, as either an Intel Core i3-8100 or AMD Ryzen 3 1300X CPU and either a GTX 1650 or RX 5500XT will be enough. To run the game at the very high graphics preset, 4K resolution @ 60 frames per second, on the other hand, a more powerful system powered by either an Intel Core i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU and either an RTX 4080 or RX 7900 XT GPU, as well as 32 GB RAM. You can find the full system requirements below.</p>

<p>The PC version of The Last of Us Part II Remastered will also come with plenty of PC-exclusive features, including NVIDIA DLSS 3 Super Resolution, AMD FSR 3.1 and AMD FSR 4 support for both upscaling and frame generation, uncapped framerate, DirectStorage support, and more. The game will also support 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9 resolutions.</p>
<p>Besides the features above, the PC version of The Last of Us Part II Remastered will also feature additional content for the No Return mode, such as two new playable characters - Bill and Marlene from The Last of Us Part I - and four new maps.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-120-hz-vrr-screen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could feature a 120 Hz screen with VRR and HDR support, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jfrb32/the_switch_2_is_rumored_to_have_a_120hz_lcd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, Famiiboards forum member Secretboy, who correctly revealed the GPU performance of the system before clock speeds were leaked back in January, recently reiterated that the console will feature a 120 Hz screen that will support both variable refresh rate and high-dynamic range. The user also said that it will be an LCD screen, and not a superior OLED screen, most likely to keep costs down.</p>
<p>Expecting Nintendo Switch 2 games to run at 120 FPS is obviously a bit unrealistic, but a 120 Hz screen with VRR support comes with some additional benefits, such as games supporting 40 FPS modes and better responsiveness, that would greatly improve the gaming experience on the system. However, while the user did reveal information on the system correctly in the past, they haven't provided any evidence for their claim, so we have to take what has been revealed today with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't take much longer to learn if the Nintendo Switch 2 will indeed sport a high refresh rate screen. The proper unveiling of the system will take place less than two weeks from today during a Nintendo Direct airing on April 2nd. Among the games that will likely be shown during the event, which will supposedly also confirm <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">when the system will launch</a>, is said to be Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The next entry in the series will blow everything else shown during the event out of the water, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-updated-patent-ai-upscaling-metroid-prime-4/">rumors.</a></p>
