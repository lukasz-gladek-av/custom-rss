			<p>Despite the silence surrounding Kingdom Hearts IV, Square Enix has confirmed it is still hard at work on it, but this is the end of the good news for fans of the series today.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/missinglink/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new message</a> shared by the publisher today, it has been confirmed that the mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing Link has been officially canceled. The publisher canceled the game as it was determined that it would be difficult to <em>"offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time."</em> At the end of the message, Square Enix confirmed that they are still hard at work on Kingdom Hearts IV, so hopefully it won't take long to see more of the next entry in the series, of which we have seen very little since its announcement.</p>
<p>The cancellation of Kingdom Hearts Missing Link seems to be part of a big 3-year reboot plan from Square Enix, which is being implemented to achieve consistent releases of major titles and more cooperation between the creative studios. The plan was outlined today in new <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20250514_01_en.pdf">documents</a> shared after the unveiling of the company's fiscal year report, and it includes the creation of an R&amp;D division for AI development tools, a multi-platform focus to improve profitability of games, placing all its games under the management of the same studio, reducing outsourcing, the cancellation of several titles and more. As it will take time to implement the plan, the publisher expects a large drop in net sales, but stable operating income for the current fiscal year ending in March 2026, so no major release should be expected.</p>
<p>Though it's likely at this point that <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-improved-visuals-will-limit-the-number-of-disney-worlds-tetsuya-nomura-reveals/">Kingdom Hearts IV</a> is not going to launch before March 31st, 2026, Square Enix still has a few titles in the pipeline. The Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remakes are still scheduled for release this year, as is the Final Fantasy VII Remake Nintendo Switch 2 port, which will unlikely offer <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-nintendo-switch-2-no-60-fps-mode-unreal-engine-5/">a 60 FPS mode</a> on the system, despite some recent hints. The publisher is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-partners-with-tbs-tv-to-create-an-original-ip-game/">working with TBS TV</a> to create a game based on an original intellectual property.</p>

			<p>Valve is working on a new project codenamed "Tf" according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by known Valve leaker Tyler McVicker, a new "Tf" codename was discovered in the latest Deadlock update, similar to how the HLX, rumored to be Half-Life 3, was discovered. This codenamed project isn't a leftover from Deadlock or any other project, as its inclusion in the Source 2 engine, which powers every game from Valve, means that there is a preset inside the engine with development tools that can be used by a team to make content for it. This is, according to the leaker, a standard procedure for every game developed in the Source 2 engine, as a differentiation of sorts is needed to indicate different projects and development tools.</p>
<p>As for what this new Valve project could be, no one can say. Though the codename seems to suggest some relation with Team Fortress, Tyler McVickers believes it is not a port of Team Fortress 2 to the Source 2 engine. Going by the timeline and the fact that the project is more recent than Deadlock and Counter-Strike 2, it's very possible that the project is currently in the same state as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghG8kZdtWoE">earliest Deadlock footage</a> available online, so it will take some time to learn more about it.</p>
<p><iframe title="VALVE NEWS &amp; DOOM THE DARK AGES DISCUSSION/GAMEPLAY" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oDs0MSChMvc?start=1415&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the project codenamed "Tf" is likely not getting revealed anytime soon, there's a good chance that the Valve project codenamed HLX will be revealed and released this year. According to Tyler McVicker, this project, rumored to be<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/"> Half-Life 3</a>, is being widely playtested ahead of a possible summer reveal and winter release. The game is reportedly also playable from beginning to end, so chances are high that, even if the game is not really Half-Life 3, the series will return after the successful VR game Half-Life Alyx.</p>

			<p>This morning, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/company/ja/news/files/077cbfa987cc7f8ee0eac7391eedb651.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a partnership with TBS TV to create a game based on an original intellectual property. TBS is one of five private broadcasters and is mostly known as the home of Ninja Warrior (known as Sasuke in Japan), a sports/reality show where a hundred participants compete in a four-stage obstacle course.</p>
<p>Here's the translated press release, which does not provide any details on the game itself (likely still in the concept phase):</p>
<p><em>Square Enix Co., Ltd. aims to continue to provide new experiences and value that will remain in the hearts and minds of customers around the world through its content and services, based on corporate philosophy of "Creating new worlds with limitless imagination. Under the new medium-term management plan, the Square Enix Group is working to deliver to customers a rich variety of content with solid appeal through the creation of new IP, the development of new business models, and the multifaceted development of IP.</em></p>
<p><em>TBS Television Inc. aims to be the starting point that moves society by delivering heart-stirring moments in a variety of fields. TBS' brand promise is to "create the world of tomorrow with the best of time. With this brand promise, we are taking on the challenge of pioneering digital content and growing into the global content brand "TBS". As part of these efforts, in July, we will launch our own game business brand "TBS GAMES" and focus on the creation of original IP originating from games. </em></p>
<p><em>Square Enix and TBS have decided to collaborate on the development of a completely new original IP game for both domestic and international markets, combining the experience and strengths they have cultivated in their respective fields. We hope you will look forward to the new original IP will be created by combining the knowledge of both companies in the entertainment field.</em></p>
<p>Considering the history of Square Enix, this could be a roleplaying game of some kind, but it's really too early to tell. However, we'll keep an eye on any news in the coming months.</p>

			<p>As part of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q4_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter financial report</a>, we learned that PS5 shipments have reached 77.8 million units to date. In the last quarter, Sony only shipped 2.8 million units of the PlayStation 5 console, a significant decrease from the 4.5 million units shipped in Q4 FY 2023. Full-year PS5 sales are also down: Sony sold 18.5 million units in fiscal year 2024, down from the 20.8 million consoles sold in fiscal year 2023.</p>
<p>Sony also shared the forecast for fiscal year 2025, and the expectation is that PlayStation 5 hardware sales will decrease even further. However, this will be offset by first-party software sales, which are expected to increase with the release of titles like Ghost of Yotei, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now set to launch on October 2</a>.</p>
<p><em>FY2025 Forecast (year-on-year)</em><br>
<em>◼ Sales: 370.0 billion yen (8%) decrease</em><br>
<em>·(ー) Decrease in sales of hardware due to a decrease in unit sales</em><br>
<em>·(ー) Impact of foreign exchange rates</em><br>
<em>·(+) Increase in sales of first-party game software titles</em><br>
<em>·(+) Increase in sales of non-first-party game software titles including add-on content</em><br>
<em>◼ OI: 65.2 billion yen（16%) increase</em><br>
<em>·(+) Impact of increase in sales of first-party game software titles</em></p>
<p>Truth be told, even this year's PS5 hardware sales decrease was largely offset by software sales on PS4 and PS5, which increased from 2023's 286.4 million units to 2024's 303.3 million units. However, most of them were for third-party games, whereas first-party game sales decreased from 39.7 million units to 28.9 million units year-over-year. The digital download ratio of full game software sales on PS4 and PS5 rose from 2023's 70% to 2024's 76%.</p>
<p>Sony also highlighted the 5% year-over-year increase in Monthly Active Users (MAUs), which rose from Q4 2023's 118 million to Q4 2024's 124 million. Admittedly, there's the fact that some PC games now <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-pc-specs-are-out-and-theyre-quite-demanding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require access to the PlayStation Network</a>, which wasn't really the case last year. This could have contributed to the higher figure registered in 2024.</p>
