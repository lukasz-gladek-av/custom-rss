<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beautiful-chinese-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in September 2021. Chinese developer Leenzee Games is developing it with clear inspiration from the Soulslike genre. According to the studio, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-been-upgraded-to-unreal-engine-5-for-improved-quality-and-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> to offer better visuals and performance.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 hands-on preview</a> penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>The story overview that 505 Games presented for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers focuses on the player character of Wuchang, a skilled female pirate warrior. Truth be told, in the time I spent suffering against a particularly malicious pair of bosses, there wasn't a shred of story exposition save for an NPC or two off the beaten path. That's exactly the way I wanted to experience to go, with the story being told through dilapidated shrines and the pervasiveness of demonic influences slipping through the cracks rather than being given a lore dump and being told explicitly why the whole world is going to hell. While I'm sure there's going to be a solid explanation for the demonic powers affecting the titular Wuchang and whatever the hell 'feathering' is, I'll gladly wait for the full release to start piecing everything together myself.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/">Larian Studios</a> boss Swen Vincke shared some of his thoughts on generative AI technology in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss">GameSpot</a>. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoko-taro-fears-that-50-years-from-now-generative-ai-tech-will-replace-game-creators/">other major creators</a> are concerned the technology could eventually replace humans, Vincke doesn't necessarily share that concern.</p>
<p>It's not that Vincke is entirely against using AI and even generative AI in development for Larian Studios. He understands that it could eventually make a developer's work go faster, but he stops short of saying that it would actually make developing a game take less time.</p>
<p>"<em>I think the naive thing is to think that it will shorten them [development times]. I think that it's an age old truth, if you give a developer two years, they're going to take three. The same thing will be the case here, with what you're going to give them in terms of abilities to do stuff . If they have the ability to do things faster, they'll just do more, which is actually what you want.</em>"</p>
<p>But when it comes to the question of humans being replaced by generative AI technology just generating whole sections of games or entire games even to ship, Vincke doesn't think that'll happen. Nor does he think it's advisable to operate in that way, where generative AI is doing everything for you.</p>
<p>"<em>I don't think you would have a competitive advantage if you do, because that is what's going to be available to everybody, right,</em>" Vincke said.</p>
<p>"<em>If the baseline goes up because generation is available to everybody, fine, that's a new reality that we're in. But you're still going to want to create something special on top of that. I think that's where teams like us will make a difference, we're a very boutique team. We're actually crafting the situations and the flow of the story by hand, it's a thing that we do.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>When we talk to people about it, this is always the discussion. 'Oh my god, our jobs are going to disappear,' and, no, but you're just going to work differently, potentially. But you're still going to be making a difference</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailers-dig-into-new-weapons-and-combat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Senior combat designer at Obsidian Rob Donovan and lead systems designer Kyle Koenig dove into the combat systems and changes to combat and gameplay in<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/"> The Outer Worlds 2</a> in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPlPgane1E">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>They talked a bit about some new changes to player movement, like how you can parkour now in The Outer Worlds 2, meaning that you can grab up onto new areas, slide into cover, and you can even spec your character to be better at things like shooting while sliding.</p>
<p>What they mostly talked about was the design philosophy the team had with combat in The Outer Worlds 2. For example, while you'll have plenty more options regarding how you want to handle a combat encounter, the enemies you'll face have also been designed to try and surprise you, and be more challenging to deal with.</p>
<p>A key aspect of that is the removal of level scaling for The Outer Worlds 2. Donovan described enemies as being classed in "<em>tiers</em>" this time around. So while you'll face a few enemies meant to be a little more difficult for newbies in the game's opening areas, by the time you've explored quite a bit and leveled up, you can return to those opening areas and crush anything in your path.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of thought put into making every path viable in combat, so there's no one playstyle that players feel like they should use, even if it goes against how they want to play the game. That said, Donovan did also state later in the video that the team considers The Outer Worlds 2 to be a "<em>ranged-first</em>" game with&nbsp;"<em>melee in the mix</em>," so players wanting a more melee-focused experience might be let down.</p>
<p>Another interesting point both Donovan and Koenig made was how the team looked at games like Destiny 2 and Call of Duty to try and improve gunplay in The Outer Worlds 2, to ensure that even if you're not creating a character that is going to be the most adept gunslinger, using any gun in your arsenal still feels good.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is currently set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC sometime later this year, with more information coming on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">June 8</a>, after Xbox has its big summer showcase for the year. Hopefully we'll learn the exact release date by then.</p>
