			<p>Nioh 3 is getting a slew of gameplay, balance, and performance improvements based on the alpha demo that was made available on PlayStation 5 for a limited time only this past June.</p>



<p>Today, Team NINJA and Koei Tecmo published an Alpha Demo Feedback Report on the game's <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/uk/feedback.html">official website</a>, showing the results of the survey players were asked to complete after playing the demo, and confirming some of the improvements coming to the final game based on feedback. These include control improvements to make them more responsive and adding customization options, adjusting the balance of enemies considered too difficult, improving the quality of the environment, improving visibility and balance of stages, and the open field to make exploration elements easier to understand and more well-balanced. </p>



<p>Going into more detail on some of these planned improvements, Team NINJA also plans to improve Global Illumination behavior in stages, reduce the fog in some areas, adjust elements that look as if they have a matte texture, and better optimize the game for a more stable framerate. Considering how the Japanese developer's games <a href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-is-yet-another-disappointing-pc-port-from-koei-tecmo/">often leave something to be desired in terms of performance even on PC,</a> gathering feedback from PC players as well would have been beneficial, but it's sadly unlikely an alpha demo will launch on the platform.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 was announced during the now traditional <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/">PlayStation State of Play June presentation</a>. While the game may not look too different from its predecessors at a glance, the third entry in the series will set itself apart by adding a new Ninja fighting style that can be switched on the flay, and a revamped level design. Even with its issues, the alpha demo showed that the series has taken a very interesting direction that is likely to improve the already engaging formula of the franchise, combining Soulslike stamina-based combat with an intricate loot system and mechanics more akin to pure action games.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 launches in early 2026 on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025.1261347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA&amp;pp=ygUKc2t5Ymxpdmlvbg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the sixth development diary for the full conversion mod project. The video is aptly titled 'The Final Stretch Toward Release', and Rebelzize assured fans that the goal is still to launch Skyblivion in 2025, as promised nearly two years ago.</p>



<p>That said, the team still needs volunteers to complete the project. Currently, they are seeking modders with expertise in scripting, quests, record editing, perks, NPC creation, level design, and 3D artists skilled in creating clothing and plant models.</p>



<p>Following this plea, the developer diary shows off the Gold Coast region, a vibrant zone located on the Western edge of Cyrodiil. The city of Anvil has been restructured around a central harbor basin, with expanded commercial, residential, and guild districts. The footage also shows Sutch, a town cut from the original Oblivion game before its release. Skyblivion restores this city to a state that balances decay and bandit occupation with expanded content, including adding a patron divine at a derelict chapel dedicated to Kynareth. Both the expansion of Anvil and the restoration of Sutch exemplify how this project differs greatly from the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which focused on a big visual overhaul and other tweaks, without, however, touching any original content.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the total conversion mod project reconstructs the entire game with new areas, gameplay enhancements, and environmental redesigns, making it feel like a fresh experience even for long-time players of the fourth mainline Elder Scrolls installment.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This philosophy extends to the whole game, including the titular Oblivion realms, which have been expanded and diversified. For example, the Deadlands now include two biomes: The Burn is the one seen in the original game, while The Sever is brand new and was inspired by the zone's rendition in The Elder Scrolls Online and introduces novel environmental hazards and enemy types to enhance gameplay challenge and variety. Lastly, there are now eleven randomly selectable worlds, up from seven, again in an effort to improve variety.</p>



<p>The next Skyblivion developer diary will focus on the Imperial City, the capital of Cyrodiil and the Empire as a whole.</p>

			<p>Bloodborne's emulation on PC with the ShadPS4 emulator has continued to improve in the past few months, so much so that the PlayStation 4 exclusive is now playable with few issues even on a dated 4 GB VRAM GPU like the RX 580.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube by ProteinGaming shows the popular game by FromSoftware running on a fresh version of the excellent PlayStation 4 emulator with a few mods at 60 FPS, 768p resolution on the RX 580 GPU. Some of the improvements recently implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/actions/runs/16673907836">emulator</a> made running the game smoothly on a GPU with low VRAM possible, fixing the VRAM leaking issues that also caused stability issues on GPUs with higher VRAM. As such, Bloodborne is now more playable than ever across many different system configurations.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The latest official version of the ShadPS4 emulator that made playing Bloodborne on PC a reality is version <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-0-10-0-major-new-feature-bloodborne/">0.10.0</a>. This version of the emulator packed <span>many improvements, which improved the emulation of several titles, including the FromSoftware game and The Last Guardian, another PS4 exclusive that has yet to be ported </span>to PC. In addition to emulation improvements, Bloodborne is receiving plenty of love from modders who have introduced many improvements to the game, including&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">enhanced visuals</a>&nbsp;that wouldn't look amiss in a proper remaster.</p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-nvidia-dlss-engine-limitations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-games-are-not-using-nvidia-dlss-likely-due-to-engine-limitations.1261308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 first-party launch titles don't use NVIDIA DLSS, likely due to engine limitations that would require a lot of work to implement.</p>



<p>Speaking during their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on why the Nintendo Switch 2 first-party launch titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza don't use NVIDIA DLSS, opting, like in the new entry in the Donkey Kong series, for the inferior AMD FSR 1 solution instead. While it's impossible to make a definitive statement, Digital Foundry believes there could be some engine limitations behind this, as the engines that power these games may, for example, not support motion vectors, which NVIDIA DLSS needs. Without engine support, implementing the upscaler would require a lot of work, which Nintendo may not have wanted to do for any reason.</p>



<p>Technical limitations, however, may not be the only reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 first-party launch titles are not using NVIDIA DLSS, as art direction may be playing a part in this as well. Nintendo games usually have cartoony visuals that don't feature complex shapes or patterns, so even if the edges aren't smooth, they aren't terrible either, reducing the need for antialiasing and upscaling. Mario Kart World is the perfect example of this, as the game looks great even without them.</p>



<p>Even so, there's a good chance that even first-party titles will eventually use NVIDIA DLSS. After all, not only is the upscaler mentioned in the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, but the Japanese company actively worked with NVIDIA to have the hardware needed to use the upscaler in the system, so they clearly saw its value. Hopefully, it won't take long for them to use it, as a game like the aforementioned Donkey Kong Bananza would clearly have benefited from it, given the image quality delivered with FSR 1.</p>

<p>NVIDIA DLSS is only one of the features that set the Nintendo Switch 2 apart from its predecessor. You can learn more about the system's offerings by reading Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-still-slated-late-2025-playable-later-this-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-is-still-slated-for-late-2025-will-be-playable-later-this-month-in-toronto.1261263/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has reconfirmed that Metroid Prime 4 is still slated to launch before the end of the year. They also revealed that it will be playable alongside other Nintendo Switch 2 games (Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition, Hades II, Borderlands 4, and Elden Ring Tarnished Edition) during <a href="https://fanexpohq.com/fanexpocanada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fan Expo Canada</a> in Toronto, Ontario. The expo runs from Thursday, August 21, to Sunday, August 24, essentially at the same time as Gamescom, at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.</p>



<p>It's definitely great news for all those gamers who have been waiting eight long years for Metroid Prime 4, ever since it was announced in June 2017. Its troubled history is well-known: Nintendo had initially handed development to Bandai Namco, only to change their mind and bring it back to historic developer Retro Studios. That inevitably affected the release timeline.</p>



<p>Between Nintendo's confirmation and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-rated-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent listing on the South Korean rating board</a> (the GRAC), there's good reason to believe Metroid Prime 4 won't be delayed again. If that's the case, a release date announcement could be forthcoming. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, our Nathan Birch was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go hands-on with the game</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal event: </p>



<p><em>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond demo on offer at the Nintendo Switch 2 event was relatively brief, essentially consisting of the game’s intro and its first boss battle. The demo opens with Samus touching down in the middle of a pitched battle between the Federation Force and those pesky Space Pirates on the remote planet of Tenmaar. For this section of the game, the usual lonely tone of Metroid games is cast aside in favor of lots of action and general activity, as a larger conflict unfolds all around you.</em></p>



<p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At EVO 2025, SEGA shared a brief new look at the upcoming New Virtua Fighter Project. The trailer shows off some combat gameplay set in the training stage. It's only about a minute, but it does look promising, featuring smooth animations and meaty punches and kicks.</p>



<p>The New Virtua Fighter Project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-game-is-in-development-sega-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> for the first time by SEGA in November 2024, though the actual <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a> came about a month later, during The Game Awards 2024, when we learned that the game was being crafted by Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</p>



<p>The game was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-pre-development-video-shows-impressive-visuals-and-animations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstrated</a> with a 'pre-development video' shared at CES 2025 during NVIDIA's keynote. Later in January, Virtua Fighter fans were able to enjoy the <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-available-on-steam-new-launch-trailer-released/">release</a> of VF5 R.E.V.O. on Steam, with all major consoles (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2) now <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-is-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-and-nintendo-switch-2-with-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to be getting the game with full cross-play enabled. That should tide them over until the new title is available, which could be in a few years' time.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While the new Virtua Fighter project was arguably the most interesting news to come out from EVO 2025, there were others. Bandai Namco said that Tekken 8 is getting a new DLC character, Armor King, on October 13 for Season 2 Character Pass owners and on October 16 for all users. Additionally, a new fighter named Miary Zo from Madagascar will be released as DLC this winter, along with a new stage called Baobab Horizon.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The upcoming fighting game Invincible VS, in development at Quarter Up, has been confirmed to feature Omni-Man as a playable character. To be honest, it would have been weirder if he was not available, since he's such a pivotal character of the IP. Invincible VS is targeting a 2026 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Finally, Arc System Works announced that a PlayStation 5 closed beta test for <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MARVEL Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> will take place between September 5 and 7, with registration now open <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on PlayStation.com</a>. The closed beta test will feature six playable characters, online matches, a spectator mode, and a training tutorial.</p>
