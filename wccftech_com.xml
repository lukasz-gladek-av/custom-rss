			<p>The price of the PlayStation VR2 headset has been permanently cut in all regions, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/a-great-new-price-for-playstation-vr2/?sf276497679=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> today.</p>
<p>From March, the virtual reality headset will be available for $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980. The Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle, which includes the headset, the Sense controller, stereo headphones, and a voucher code for the Horizon Call of the Mountain game, will also be available for the same price. The lower price also makes it a more enticing buy for those looking for a PC VR headset, as the PlayStation VR2 headset can be used on PC with the adapter that was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-system-requirements/">last year.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 launched two years ago but failed to significantly impact the market, mostly due to its high launch price, which has essentially stayed the same until now, not counting temporary price drops and deals. Still, the high price was worth it for VR aficionados, as the headset delivered a next-gen VR experience that is significantly superior to that offered by its predecessor, as Kai highlighted in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 headset had a lot to prove to justify a cost higher than that of the base PlayStation 5 console needed to operate it. The hands-on test confirms that this is how next-gen should look and play in virtual reality with an experience unlike anything else in the HMD space. Every aspect of the first PlayStation VR has been improved (aside from Cinematic Mode largely remaining as is) with no expense spared for comfort and design. This is the sort of revolution in virtual reality that can showcase not just the experiences that are fun to play but also those that can take advantage of the next-generation console’s power.&nbsp;</em></p>

			<p>Today, 4A Games Ukraine made two big announcements: one, it's being rebranded to Reburn; two, it is developing a new cooperative sci-fi first-person shooter game called La Quimera.</p>
<p>First things first. Metro fans were probably puzzled by the aforementioned sentence, just like I was when I got the news. Let's clarify things right away, then. Following the beginning of the political instability in Ukraine, dating all the way back to 2014, part of the team at 4A Games moved to Malta. Back then, both studios still worked together on Metro Exodus.</p>
<p>After the launch of Metro Exodus in 2019, 4A Games Malta and 4A Games Ukraine were both big enough to handle projects separately. A few months later, the Malta office <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games-new-world-interactive-and-four-more-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired by Embracer</a>, while the Ukraine office remained independent and received unrelated investments to make its own IP, which would become La Quimera. The studios are effectively separate now, as reflected in the rebrand, although they are both allowed to use the 4A Engine seen in Metro titles.</p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series. We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>

<p>The game is set in a Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle environments. Players will step into the customizable exosuit of a down-on-his-luck PMC (Private Military Company) soldier battling rival factions. The world and story of La Quimera were written and created by movie director Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren. Combining Latin American folklore with advanced weaponry and technology, La Quimera will be playable in single-player mode or with up to two friends in co-op for a total of three players.</p>

<p>Reburn promises that fans of the Metro franchise will enjoy the familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling mixed with new gameplay experiences through unique and highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons. There's no release date yet, but Reburn said more about the game will be revealed in the coming months.</p>
