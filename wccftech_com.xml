			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> is planning to host another <strong>State of Play </strong>event in <strong>February 2026</strong>, according to the well-known and reliable insider, NateTheHate. They don't provide any more information as to what the event will focus on or what it might feature, but they do confidently confirm there is an event planned for next month.</p>



<p>When directly asked by <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2015679942957138341">a user on X (formerly Twitter)</a> if there will be a State of Play in February this year, NateTheHate simply replies, "<em>There will be, yes</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>PlayStation has gotten into the habit of only confirming these showcases a day or two before they actually happen, so we probably won't know if this claim is correct or not until next week at the earliest, but it is good to hear that we should have something to look forward to when it comes to PlayStation news for 2026.</p>



<p>That said, the timing of these showcases is becoming so predictable that you can probably already predict next year's run of shows. <strong>Since 2021</strong>, PlayStation has held a State of Play showcase of some kind in the second month of the year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2021-new-announcements-10-games/">That initial February event was a general State of Play</a> that showcased upcoming games at the time, like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">Returnal,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkanes-deathloop-is-free-for-a-week-on-the-epic-games-store/">Deathloop</a>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"> Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, </strong>and <strong>Sifu, </strong>to name a few. </p>



<p>2022's February State of Play was instead <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-7-state-of-play-cars-tracks-cafe/">a dedicated event for <strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong></a>, with 2023's February State of Play returning to a general event, <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-reveals-its-final-3-launch-characters-during-state-of-play/">featuring looks at <strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gameplay-reveal/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></strong>, and more. The 2024 February State of Play was once again a dedicated event, this time for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></strong>, though interestingly, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-playstation-january-31-15-games-40-minutes/">preceded by a general event that took place on January 31 that year</a>, so it was a bit of 'have your cake and eat it too' to start the year. </p>



<p>And finally, in case you forgot, there was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">a general State of Play event last year</a>, which included a look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">Saros</a></strong>, the release date for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a></strong>, a look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creators-mindseye-game-slated-to-launch-this-summer/">MindsEye</a></strong>, and more.</p>



<p>Considering the fact that PlayStation has used the month of February to host one of these events for the last five years, it was already a pretty good bet it would do so again in 2026. These events aren't exactly locked into place every year, so we can't exactly take it for granted that we'll always have one in February, but for now, the pattern of showcases in a year for PlayStation seems to always include one in February.</p>



<p>The big remaining question is whether this year's event will be dedicated to one game, or a more general event. If it's a dedicated event, it could perhaps be a dedicated event for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/">third installment of the <strong>Final Fantasy Remake Trilogy</strong></a>, or a dedicated event for <strong>Saros</strong>, which we know is <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">due to arrive in the first half of the year on <strong>April 30, 2026</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It might even be one last hype-up event for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">Marathon</a></strong>, ahead of its arrival in March. Hopefully, we'll know as early as next week.</p>
