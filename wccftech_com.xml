			<p>After two of the games included in December 2025's list of PS Plus Extra and Premium games <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-on-connait-les-tetes-daffiche-des-ajouts-de-decembre-2025-60803">joining the game catalog leaked early</a>, PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-assassins-creed-mirage-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-skate-story-and-more/">now officially confirmed</a> all ten of the games coming to PlayStation Plus for subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>



<p>There are three big headlining titles for the month, one of them being a day-one release that is actually already available for Extra and Premium subscribers. That game is, of course, Sam Eng's Skate Story, which puts you in the Vans of a demon made of glass and pain who must skate through Hell to try and eat the Moon. It's a fever dream of a story if there ever was one, and it's one of the more exciting indies to end off 2025.</p>



<p>The other two big headlining games are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, which were also the two games that leaked courtesy of Dealabs. As for the rest of the games joining the catalog, other notable titles include <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/granblue-fantasy-relink-exceeding-expectations/">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a>, Lego Horizon Adventures (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-five-games-december-2025-lego-horizon-adventures-neon-white/">which is also one of the PS Plus Essential games for the month</a>), and Planet Coaster 2.</p>

<p>PS Plus Premium subscribers only get one addition to the Classic's Game Catalog for the month of December, but at least it's a game that has no trouble standing out on its own, as Soulcaliber III is now available for Premium subscribers.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for December 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Skate Story (PS5)</li>



<li>Granblue Fantasy: ReLink (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Planet Coaster 2 (PS5)</li>



<li>Cat Quest III (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Lego Horizon Adventures (PS5)</li>



<li>Paw Patrol: Grand Prix (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Paw Patrol World (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Soulcaliber III (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PlayStation Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable inclusion for what PS Plus subscribers are getting in December 2025 is a credit for the Sony Pictures Core store. The number of credits you receive will depend on which tier you are subscribed to, though PlayStation does not make it clear how many credits PS Plus Extra and Premium members get, or if PS Plus Essential subscribers get any credits at all.</p>



<p>The promotion also claims to only come as part of a purchase for a 12-month PS Plus subscription (any tier), though it doesn't clarify if this offer is available to those already subscribed to an annual plan. The promotion is active from December 11, 2025, to January 12, 2026, so perhaps more information will become clear once it's live. Hopefully, the offer is available to all subscribers, regardless of when they purchased their subscription.</p>

			<p>Today, AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-official-200-games-supported-3x-performance-boost-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched its long awaited FSR Redstone update</a>, which includes FSR Upscaling (formerly known as FSR 4), FSR Frame Gen, FSR Ray Regeneration, and FSR Radiance Caching.</p>



<p>The first two are improved versions of previous technologies. The third one, Ray Regeneration, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-sees-an-unexpected-debut-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually already introduced by Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Developed in partnership with Microsoft, Ray Regeneration is a machine learning-powered denoiser that focuses on restoring details to ray traced effects, which can be troublesome in upscaled scenes. It is, essentially, AMD's version of NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</p>



<p>However, FSR Radiance Caching is not yet available in any game. During today's presentation, AMD showcased a tech demo of the feature in Warhammer 40K Darktide, Fatshark's first-person online action game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fatshark-presents-darktide-new-hive-scum-class-confirms-no-pvp-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just got the new Hive Scum class DLC</a>. Viewers assumed this meant Darktide would also be the first game to implement FSR Radiance Caching, but in a press release, the Swedish developer clarified that  the tech is 'experimental' and therefore not currently planned for release in Darktide's live build, as it requires 'further development, optimization, and quality verification before it could be integrated into a live service game.'</p>



<p>That said, Fatshark was eager to jump at the opportunity to develop the tech demo when AMD approached them about it this past Summer. Their Chief Technology Officer, Mikael Hansson, said in a statement: </p>



<p><em>Technology is meant to be built and shared together. Working with innovative powerhouses like AMD keeps us sharp, encourages diversification in game technology, and strengthens the entire industry. It’s fun, it’s challenging, and it’s a long-term investment, not just in Fatshark’s future, but in the future of gaming.</em></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-sdk-unreal-engine-plugin-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released FSR Redstone SDK</a>, AMD describes FSR Radiance Caching as a 'state-of-the-art illumination cache designed to work in tandem with Monte Carlo path tracing to boost rendering performance. At its core is an online machine learning model that continuously trains on complex, multi-bounce global illumination (GI) on-device and in real-time. The result is richer, more immersive lighting environments that respond dynamically without the need for pre-computation or baking.'</p>



<p>It sounds fairly similar to NVIDIA's RTX Neural Radiance Cache, another technique that <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aims to make path tracing faster with the help of machine learning</a> by inferring an infinite amount of bounces after the initial one or two bounces from path traced rays. RTX Neural Radiance Cache was released through the RTX Global Illumination SDK <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at CES 2025</a>, though it is only available in Portal with RTX so far.</p>

			<p>Across the board, the tech industry is currently still rattled by issues surrounding memory chip shortages. Companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/memory-shortages-are-so-terrible-that-samsung-is-shifting-hbm-production-towards-ddr5/">Samsung are making major shifts in their production lines,</a> and other companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/framework-announces-laptop-memory-upgrade-price-hike-but-insists-it-wont-overcharge-customers/">Framework have opted to directly tell consumers that prices will rise due to shortages</a>. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">Bloomberg</a> points to Nintendo losing $14 billion in share value as fears around memory shortages continue to rise.</p>



<p>Nintendo's shares have declined on almost every trading day in December so far, dropping to their lowest level since May 2025. According to the report (via <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/">TrendForce</a>), Nintendo now has to spend <strong>41% more</strong> on the 12GB RAM chips it uses to make Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. NAND storage prices also rose by <strong>8%</strong>, and with the drop in share value, the question quickly turns to 'when,' not 'if,' Nintendo will raise prices on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>And of course, it's not just the rising price of the console that's a concern. Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates told Bloomberg that Nintendo has already passed on the rising costs of memory chips to consumers through the cost of express microSD cards. "<em>The rise of NAND prices is starting to really impact express SD card prices. A 256GB express SD card costs $89.99 on Amazon. This is effectively a cost that Nintendo has passed on to the gamer</em>," said Smithers.</p>



<p>Of course, you don't need to buy an express microSD card for your Switch 2; you can try to make do with the console's built-in storage, but with the increasing number of developers turning to Game Key Card versions of their games for Switch 2 and the current landscape of digital games increasing in the amount of storage they consume, even the Switch 2's increased amount of internal storage compared to the original Switch doesn't go as far as it could for most players. </p>



<p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-players-trouble-finding-microsd-express-cards-microsd-shortages/">MicroSD Express Cards are simply getting more difficult to find</a> as these shortages continue, so while Smithers isn't wrong in pointing to the increase in their price as a total increase to the cost of buying a Switch 2, it may not factor in for some buyers simply because they can't find a MicroSD Express card to overpay on.</p>



<p>Smithers also claims that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-nintendo-switch-2-deals-save-on-console-accessories-and-games/">recent Black Friday sales for Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundles</a> were one of the seasonal sales "<em>surprises</em>," claiming, "<em>You wouldn't expect it [Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle] to be discounted this close to the holiday season</em>."</p>



<p>Sure, the Switch 2 was one of the best-selling consoles this Black Friday (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/">even though, at least in the EU, PS5 still claimed the top spot</a>), but there's concern it can keep up with its popularity, Black Friday discount or not, with its current stock and how much more expensive every single Switch 2 unit is to manufacture now.</p>



<p>Even with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa doing his best <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/">to reassure shareholders and consumers that the cost of the console will "<em>remain stable</em>" for the immediate future</a>, last month, that could quickly change in the new year, after the holiday season winds down.</p>
