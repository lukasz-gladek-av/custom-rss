			<p>Today, inZOI Studio (a subsidiary of KRAFTON) unveiled the detailed system requirements and optimal settings for the highly anticipated life simulation game for PC. While the minimum requirements are more or less in line with what we've come to expect nowadays (they even require less RAM than <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-will-require-rtx-2060-gpu-and-16gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall's</a>), to play at higher graphics presets, you will need a very powerful computer. The High preset even recommends AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which launched just a few months ago to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-3d-v-cache-cpu-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent reviews</a>, establishing itself as the best CPU gamers can buy when it comes to the quality/price ratio and its efficiency.</p>

<p>inZOI is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and delivers not only high quality graphics but also high-fidelity simulations, the developer said in an attempt to explain the high requirements.</p>
<p>The studio has prepared eight different preset options to allow players to easily find the best visuals and performance for their system. These presets also confirm the inclusion of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, Intel XeSS, and ray tracing. There's no mention of Frame Generation, though.</p>

<p>The Better Graphics mode will focus on delivering the best image quality while playing inZOI at the expense of possible frame drops and longer loading. Better Performance, as you can easily guess, reduces visual quality and optimized simulation speed to increase frame rates.</p>

<p>It's worth reminding that inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch on March 28</a> in early access. In the future, the developers will add an automatic system to adjust in-game settings according to the PC specs. Of course, they also plan to further optimize the game for a variety of configurations.</p>
<p>The game will also offer other interesting features, such as official mods (<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-partners-with-overwolf-to-bring-official-mods-into-life-simulation-game-inzoi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to a partnership with Overwolf</a>) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI companions named Smart ZOI</a>, who will be powered by NVIDIA ACE.</p>

			<p>Dino Crisis may be the next CAPCOM series to see a proper comeback in the future, following the return of the Onimusha and Okami franchises, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu on Bluesky, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis on March 4th in Japan. By itself, this doesn't mean much, as companies file a lot of trademarks that end up getting unused just to hold onto their IPs, but there are good reasons to be hopeful in this case. As highlighted by ResetERA forums member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-trademarked-dino-crisis-on-march-4-in-japan.1131402/post-136887345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jawmuncher</a>, any trademark filed in Japan usually shows how a company has a real intention to do something with the IP, and there's a precedence of CAPCOM actually reviving a franchise following a similar trademark filing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha series.</a></p>

<p>While the Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, the survival horror series by CAPCOM has already made a very small comeback with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">recent GOG releases</a> of the first two entries, complete with new features such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support and much more. Hopefully, the re-release of the two classic games won't be the end of the series, although series creator Shinji Mikami believes CAPCOM has no reason to<a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/"> bring back Dino Crisis while the Monster Hunter series continues to be successful.</a></p>
