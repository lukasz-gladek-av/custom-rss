			<p>Today, Spanish developer MercurySteam has confirmed the name of their new project, a single player dark fantasy action RPG titled Blades of Fire. They also <a href="https://x.com/ProjectIronGame/status/1894054680499716236?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> its unveiling would occur this Thursday at 10:30 AM Pacific Time or 18:30 GMT at IGN Fan Fest 2025.</p>
<p>The Madrid-based studio released several noteworthy titles over its more than 20 years in the games industry, such as the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow trilogy for Konami and two acclaimed <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-dread-is-now-the-series-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid games</a> for Nintendo. Their self-published game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mercurysteams-new-game-is-raiders-of-the-broken-planet-an-online-multiplayer-asymmetric-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raiders of the Broken Planet</a>, later <a href="https://wccftech.com/spacelords-raiders-reborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relaunched as Spacelords</a>, did not succeed, though. This time, they have partnered with another publisher (505 Games) instead of going solo once again.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of info on Blades of Fire except for an interview Gamereactor <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/project-iron-will-have-strong-graphics-storytelling-and-action-1292253/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did with Game Director Enric Álvarez in 2023</a>. On that occasion, he said:</p>
<p><em>I think that we're going to surprise you with this game. I think that it's going to please people, it's going to surprise people, and it's going to shock people as well. Of course, it will be a full-blown MercurySteam game, so it will have strong graphics, strong storytelling, strong action, and many more things I can't disclose right now.</em></p>
<p><em>We always work with our own technology. We can afford that luxury because from the day one in the studio, 20 years ago, we had the capacity to do it. And the Mercury Engine is still there in full form. I mean, it's an excellent technology. And the best thing is that it's our property, and then we develop exactly what we need, like a tailor-made suit.</em></p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be powered by the studio's internal technology and features 'strong storytelling and action' elements. We'll have to wait just three days to learn more directly from MercurySteam. Stay tuned until then!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-isnt-in-any-danger-despite-netease-involvement-confirms-dev/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> about NetEase effectively pulling out of several of its investments out of China, fans of the promising action role-playing game The Blood of Dawnwalker were worried about its future. After all, developer Rebel Wolves did <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> receiving an investment from NetEase in November 2022.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, this game&nbsp;<span>isn't in any danger, as Co-Owner and Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc clarified&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a> earlier today. NetEase is just a minority investor, and Rebel Wolves has already</span>&nbsp;found another publisher (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bandai Namco</a>) for this game.</p>
<p><em>I've also read the articles suggesting that Rebel Wolves may be in danger due to the rumoured situation at NetEase. First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues.</em></p>
<p><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker's production is fully funded, and we work alongside our partners and friends from Bandai Namco, our game's global publisher, to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life. The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves.</em><br>
<em>NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Founded by former developers of The Witcher 3</a>, the Polish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> The Blood of Dawnwalker in mid-January, showing a promising title that blends a narrative focus with lots of player agency. In the game, players will take the role of Coen, a vampire from 14th century Carpathia who - as implied by the title - can also walk in the sun. Following the Black Death plague, his homeland has been invaded by a powerful coven of vampires, and it will be up to him to stop them and rescue his family. There will also be a time limit of thirty days and thirty nights to do so. The gameplay loop will be different at nighttime, with a more supernatural twist that shows off Coen's vampire powers.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the players will have many choices to make in what the studio is calling a 'narrative sandbox'. Rebel Wolves did say not to expect a huge game in terms of scope and playtime like The Witcher 3, though, which is understandable given that it is a new studio. The game has no release date yet, but the developers will reveal more about The Blood of Dawnwalker later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki%E2%80%99s-eerie-season-starts-after-february-26-maintenance.1117266/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-starts-after-february-26-maintenance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next major update to Infinity Nikki will be coming soon and will launch after server maintenance takes place on February 26. The new season will launch on February 26 and will run until March 25, where players will be given the opportunity to explore the Queen's Palace Ruins and uncover all of the secrets that lay on the grounds. This comes in the form of a cursed song, and players will have to help out the legendary creature Bullquet in a sweet side quest. If you are interested in what the Eerie Season has to offer in Infinity Nikki, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The official trailer for Version 1.3 [Eerie Season] is now live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQG9MKHvB_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Eerie Season will take players away from the vibrancy and pastel colors and instead transport them to a world filled with Gothic aesthetics, Supernatural phenomena, and new challenges.</p>
<p>Throughout the ruins of Queen Philomia's palace, there have been peculiar singing voices that echo off of the walls of the palace, which has led people to believe that the ruins are cursed. Once the day turns to night, the melodies can be heard through the corridors, where the residents of Florawish have become unnerved and fear the grounds of the ruins. As a result of this, Nikki and Momo take a journey into the Queen's Palace Ruins, where there are plenty of secrets to be uncovered.</p>
<p>The initial event will be named The Queen's Lament. Once players have completed this, they will then gain access to the Queen's Palace Ruins: Inner Court dungeon, which provides a new, scary challenge to take on.&nbsp; In addition, once players have cleared this dungeon, they will then be able to visit the high tower in the Queen's Palace Ruins at night, where they will be able to play the piano beside Ms. Glove.</p>
<p>Through the Eerie Season, players will be able to obtain 15 Revelation Crystals and a new outfit named the Dream Chaser completely for free. In the Heartfelt Gifts Store, there will be three more free outfits to obtain, which brings the grand total to nine free outfits throughout the history of Infinity Nikki. <a href="https://www.infoldgames.com/en/home#product">Infold Games</a> continues to be dedicated to the community of Infinity Nikki, and continues to work to optimize the game and ensure that players are having a good time playing the game, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-available-to-wishlist-on-steam/">title set to soon release</a> on Steam.</p>
<p>Players will be able to experience the Gothic and supernatural beauty of Eerie Season once it is released after the maintenance on February 26, where the season will then run until March 25.</p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss has revealed the upcoming content roadmap for Black Desert in the month of March, where the game will receive its first-ever Hardcore Server, alongside the final chapter of the Atoraxxion storyline, Orzekea, and some major quality-of-life improvements that will make the Black Desert experience much more enjoyable for those who play it.</p>
<p>Black Desert has had some <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-onlines-new-expansion-is-out-now/">major updates</a> as of late, with the most recent expansion for the game being released five months ago, introducing players to medieval Korea.</p>
<p>If you want to hear the developers talking about what is due to come in Black Desert, make sure to check out the Developer's Latest Update video below, where there is a 15-minute video dedicated to each of the major updates coming to the game.</p>

<p>First, the Hardcore Server will be launching on March 13 for Black Desert, with the server shaping up to be the ultimate PvP experience, where players will have to try and survive as long as they possibly can while accumulating points by defeating monsters and taking down other players. Compared to other games, the content in the Hardcore Server is only playable for two hours a day. The points that the player accumulates can then be used to obtain generous rewards to praise your success in the game.</p>
<p>On March 20, the final chapter of the Atoraxxion storyline will be making its way into Black Desert. The chapter is titled Orzekea, and will take players on an adventure through the mysteries of Orze, who has been a pivotal character in the Atoraxxion conflict. With this comes some major plot twists to the story, with its final boss, 'Orze of Thorns bringing a new challenge to players, where they will have to team up to overtake the boss together and bring an end to the storyline.</p>
<p>While there isn't a set date for when the cosmetics and quality of life updates will be added to the game, new cosmetic outfits for players to experiment with are confirmed to arrive next week. The <a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Main/Index?_region=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Black Desert website</a> is likely to be updated with when the outfits are due to be released in the game.</p>
<p>The Medeia outfit will be available for those who play female characters. This outfit comes with a mysterious, creepy witch theme, while the Sunny Breeze costume will be available for all classes, ringing in the upcoming Spring season with a vibrant and floral aesthetic.</p>
<p>Along with all of these major updates for March, Black Desert will also be receiving an All-in-One Preset feature. When this is released, players will then be given the option to customize their settings for different types of gameplay in Black Desert, allowing players to toggle the settings they need by applying the necessary preset.</p>
