			<p>One of the best features of Nintendo has been announced that it will be discontinued. This is the Nintendo Gold Points program, where you would be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/six-weeks-of-activities-discounts-rewards-start-today-on-nintendo-switch/"> accrue Gold Points</a> with digital or physical purchases you made for the Nintendo Switch. However, it's now been announced by Nintendo that the company will be discontinuing the Gold Points program on March 24, 2025. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67660#s1q4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official statement</a> is available on the Nintendo website, where the details of the discontinuation are listed. While points won't be added to your total after March 24, you will have a year to redeem the points you've stored or 12 months from the purchase date of the item.</p>
<p>This is the typical amount of time that Gold Points were available for previously, with them expiring after a year. So, while Nintendo is discontinuing the points program, you won't lose them early. However, if you forget to use them or simply decide not to use them, they will be removed from your account after the expiration date.</p>
<p>Up until March 24, you are still able to earn Gold Points if you redeem your physical product or if you purchase a digital product. After this date, consumers won't earn Gold Points from purchasing digital content.</p>
<p>After the cut-off date, Nintendo has also noted that "some retailers may continue to sell Nintendo eShop cards that disclose earning Gold Points." However, this will not be the case. You will still be able to purchase and redeem the Nintendo eShop cards as normal, but you won't earn any Gold Points when using the cards for purchases.</p>
<p>For those who pre-ordered digital content or purchased a physical copy of a game that would typically come with Gold Points, the specified amount of Gold Points will be available for the consumers as long as the purchases and pre-orders were made before the cut-off date. Physical games that were released on or before March 24 will also still be eligible to earn the Nintendo Gold Points, even if the game was purchased after the cut-off date. However, if the game was released after the cut off date, you will not be able to get the Gold Points.</p>
<p>It's not been specified by Nintendo as to why the company has decided to discontinue the Nintendo Gold Points program, which was utilized by many. However, the Platinum Points will continue to be available, which was a significantly less beneficial program than those of the Gold Points.</p>

			<p>Infold Games has confirmed that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/">cozy open-world adventure gacha game</a>, Infinity Nikki, will be making its way to Steam. This is an ongoing effort from the developers to help make the game more accessible to a wider audience, as well as continue its efforts to engage with its community. For those who are excited about Infinity Nikki, the game is already available to wishlist on Steam. At the moment, there isn't a set release date for when the title will be playable via Steam, but it will be coming in the future.</p>
<p>Since the game was initially released on December 5, 2024, Infinity Nikki has taken the gaming world by storm. Players worldwide have been gathering in Mirawish to unlock new outfits and complete the story. So far, there have been over 20 million downloads worldwide. With the release of the game on Steam, that number will surely grow, with more players being able to access Infinity Nikki for the first time. The Steam version will also include seamless integration with the Infold account system, which will allow players to access their accounts and continue their progress across all available platforms.</p>
<p>Once the game is released on Steam, players will have access to the full range of features, which includes achievements, controller support, and social integration.

<p>Since its launch, Infinity Nikki has been incredibly popular, receiving critical acclaim for the blend of gameplay, merging dress-up gameplay with open-world questing, platforming, and puzzles along the way. Players will get to explore the expansive world of Miraland, where there are beautiful landscapes providing many opportunities for virtual photography, along with some fun and simple combat. Players can also expect to solve puzzles to get Whimstars, get to fuss over adorable pets, and uncover some of Miraland's hidden secrets, such as the paper cranes and ghost trains.</p>
<p>Updates are released frequently for Infinity Nikki, adding new outfits, quests, and banners to pull from for those who engage with the gacha mechanics. The game is entirely free to play, with optional microtransactions that have the potential to provide you with more outfits and customization for Nikki.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Infinity Nikki once it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases on Steam</a>? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-creator-thinks-the-narrative-of-having-the-most-powerful-system-is-not-helpful-nowadays/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Having the most powerful console is a message that no longer works in the current console market, according to the creator of Xbox, as it was a story that only worked in the past for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/?callback=in&amp;code=MZY2ZJDMZDUTOWJKMY0ZYMRHLWE4YZUTZDU1ZWE2ZMQ5YMMZ&amp;state=f568e241a61f4d22b9243c504e3ba67e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoGamer,</a> the creator of the original Microsoft console Seamus Blackley commented on how having the most powerful console back in the original Xbox and PlayStation 2 generation was important, but not so much nowadays, as in that console generation, we were still in the <em>"nascent stages of graphics,"</em> and taking a hit in the cost of goods of the cogs was critical to position the system against the Japanese consoles, one-up them in this regard, and bet on the games being better.</p>
<p>Despite the narrative that having the most powerful console may have helped, the reason to buy any console has always been about the content, and the Xbox creator thinks this hasn't changed at all. What has changed is that this battle for the content has moved away from any sort of technical achievement and is now centered on creating a sort of experience that gets people to want it, regardless of what sorts of visuals it can push. The Nintendo Switch is the prime example of this, as with its content, Nintendo managed to get people to purchase a console released in 2017 powered by underclocked 2013 hardware.</p>
<p>The Xbox creator's statements don't come as a surprise to anyone who has been keeping tabs on the gaming industry. With Microsoft pushing its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/">multiplatform strategy</a>, bringing former Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, and some developers suggesting <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-will-eventually-abandon-console-exclusives/">Sony may follow suit</a>, the importance of content over hardware is becoming increasingly clear, and with future home consoles unlikely to offer <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-smaller-performance-gains-higher-prices/">massive leaps in visual fidelity without significant price increases that could limit their appeal</a>, making compelling content is set to become more crucial than ever, regardless of the platform.</p>
