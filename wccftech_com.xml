			<p>A lot of thought went into when to release Battlefield 6, but EA continued to target this Fall, regardless of Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">Variety</a>, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele commented on the release date of the highly anticipated next entry in the first-person shooter series, saying that they <em>"have always have been heads down, unblinking about this fall and executing at a level of excellence,"</em> working hard with the development team to not get distracted by anything else happening around them. With the level of effort and investement put into the game, however, the last thing the publisher wanted was to put Battlefield 6 in harm's way or too close to the release of something really large, so EA did have their eye on Grand Theft Auto VI, and were thinking about different scenarios, but weren't allowing these scenarios to impact schedules or development.</p>



<p>The confidence EA is showing in Battlefield 6 definitely seems to be warranted. Kai recently had the chance to try out the game and has found it to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">a return to proper form</a> after the blunders of the last entries in the series. </p>



<p><em>In a lot of ways, Battlefield 6 is how DICE and Ripple Effect have listened to the feedback from fans and brought back the massive squad shooter in a proper return to form. Despite the mayhem of crumbling infrastructure, this is exactly what I’ve wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs.</em></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">October 10</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA Online Could Soon Require Age Verification to Play or Access Select Features]]></title>

			<p>Rockstar Games is reportedly planning to implement age verification in GTA Online to play the game or access some of the online game's features.</p>



<p>As reported by Tez2 on X, users may need to verify their age in the future to play the game or access certain features like phone messages, text chat, and Snapmatic. Tez2 couldn't say which regions could be targeted for these age verification checks, but there's little doubt players in the UK will be the first to be impacted by age verification if it goes into effect, considering the enforcement of the Online Safety Act is expected to ramp up in the coming months.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Jokes aside, Rockstar is planning to implement age assurance checks in the near future, rolling them out by region.</p><p>You may need to verify your age to access <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GTAOnline</a>, or certain features, like phone messages, text chat, Snapmatic, may be restricted until you verify your age. <a href="https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh">https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/QYVaydlbhZ">pic.twitter.com/QYVaydlbhZ</a></p></div>— Tez2 (@TezFunz2) <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1951058585359634459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although age checks are yet to become mandatory, select publishers and developers already started implementing some form of age verification ahead of time, like Roblox and Epic Games, to prevent younger players from accessing to some features like voice and or text chat, so it wouldn't be surprising for Rockstar Games to do the same in GTA Online, considering the game is constantly under intense scrutiny due to its setting and content. As the developer is also said to be working on a new version of their online game to coincide with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-online-sold-separately-30-fps-target/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> next year, it will be interesting to see how age verification will impact this new project in some way.</p>



<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game's latest updates on its official website.</p>

			<p>It has been a while since new information was unearthed regarding the HLX project at Valve, which is thought to be Half-Life 3. Despite the lack of new details, however, work on the project seems to have been proceeding steadily, and development may have reached the final phase, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>In new videos shared yesterday by Tyler McViker and Gabe Follower, it is reported that Counter-Strike 2's massive July 29 update not only brought changes and improvements to the competitive game but also some behind-the-scenes changes to the Source 2 engine related to the Half-Life 3 HLX project. One new line of code in particular, the one mentioning thumpers to scare antlions, which mirrors a line of code in Half-Life 2, seems to be a direct message to dataminers, and further confirmation that the project continues to be in active development.</p>



<p>Not only does the HLX project continue to be in active development, but it may have reached the final phase of development. The most significant change introduced in the new Source 2 engine update is the complete refactoring of AI scripting in the FGD and localization token files. This is pretty significant, as this refactoring has changed how NPCs react to in-game events, going from sounds to what are not called AI events. This has been known to be an HLX feature for a while, but the difference now is that there's a definition file for these AI events, which suggests that the feature is done and polished up to a point that it can be used in scripting and map-making. Hammer, Valve's level design tool, was also recently updated to support many of the Half-Life 3 HLX features discovered in the past few months via datamining, such as vehicle mechanics, wind mechanics, model deformation, thermodynamics mechanics, and more. The fact that the new documentation reads like a tutorial to explain how to use the development tools properly to take advantage of these features also adds more fuel to the fire and even suggests how mod support could be coming not too long after the project launches. Ultimately, this sort of polishing and development tool updates usually happen at the end of development, but considering how differently Valve operates compared to the vast majority of game developers, it cannot be said for certain if the game is close to being announced and released.</p>

<p>Other recent happenings may also suggest that the HLX project thought to be Half-Life 3 could be in the final phase of development. Gabe Follower claims in their video that some parts of the project are already finished and need only to be polished, and developers have started moving on to other projects. Usually, this means the project may have been abandoned, but Gabe Follower believes these developers are moving on to other projects because their work on HLX is no longer needed.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, Valve operates differently from other game development studios, so even if the game is in the final phase of development, an announcement and release timeline for the HLX project, thought to be Half-Life 3, remains unknown. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to learn more about what's next for one of gaming's most celebrated series. </p>
