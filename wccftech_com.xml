			<p><strong>CI Games</strong> is getting ready to release its third <strong>Lords of the Fallen</strong> game with <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, sometime later this year, which we last got a look at during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong> with a new gameplay trailer. Outside of CI Games' chief executive officer, <strong>Marek Tyminski</strong>, promising that this <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-wont-be-politically-correct-will-feature-attractive-females-skimpy-armors/">fantasy action game won't be "<em>politically correct</em>"</a> and that it will feature female characters in revealing armour, in a new developer deep-dive, game director <strong>James Lowe</strong> promises that the combat will be <strong><em>"bolder, braver, bloodier</em>."</strong></p>



<p>A quick rundown on the series, if you're confused as to why the game with the '2' at the end of it is actually the third in the franchise. In 2014, CI Games released <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265300/Lords_Of_The_Fallen_2014/">Lords of the Fallen</a>,</strong> an action RPG that failed to really make a big splash. Almost a decade later, the studio decided to reboot the series and released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/"><strong>Lords of the Fallen (2023)</strong></a>, which, despite its myriad of issues at launch, fared far better. The game's commercial success was enough to drive CI Games to make a sequel, which brings us to Lords of the Fallen 2, due out sometime in 2026, not to be confused with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/"><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2.0</strong></a>, which refers to the massive overhaul update CI Games put out almost two years after the 2023 reboot to fix it.</p>



<p>Getting back to today's combat deep-dive, as part of the studio's Lifting the Veil series on its official YouTube channel, CI Games put out a nearly 42-minute video discussing and showcasing how it is improving and updating combat in Lords of the Fallen 2, trying to address players' concerns from its predecessor while also introducing new elements for the sequel.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights about combat that Lowe discusses alongside lead systems designer <strong>Daniel Regan</strong>, producer <strong>Alex Harkin</strong>, and creative strategist <strong>Ryan Hill</strong> include how the team is doubling down on things players loved from the 2023 reboot, like dual-wielding, a great emphasis on players' speed and maneuverability, and a slew of new animations to make combat feel more varied than it did in 2023.</p>



<p>It's not just a greater variety in animations, but in weapon choices, as CI Games is focusing on letting players swap seamlessly between melee attacks to spell casting and back, while also trying out the barrage of new weapons.</p>



<p>The panel discussion is altogether an honest conversation about how the studio is trying to improve and fix the mistakes it made in previous entries. It's clear that CI Games wants to make this game hit in a way that its previous games never did, which is ultimately an exciting proposition for anyone looking forward to checking out this upcoming action RPG.</p>



<p>Another point that Lowe references in the panel is wanting to "<em>respect the player's time</em>," which was something that he told Wccftech that he and the team wanted to focus on back in December 2025, when we got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/respect-the-players-time-lords-of-the-fallen-ii-game-director-james-lowe-discusses-key-principles-defining-the-game-interview/">sit down with him for an interview</a> following its gameplay showcase at The Game Awards. </p>
