			<p>Funcom has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/">Dune: Awakening</a> has surpassed&nbsp;<strong>1 million copies sold<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>as part of an infographic that includes several statistics about how the game's launch has gone for players. The sales milestone also makes it Funcom's fastest-selling game to date.</p>
<p>According to the infographic, 816,720 players have been swallowed up by Shai-Hulud while surveying 25,529,505 square kilometers of Arrakis and consuming more than 6,110,692,000 grams of spice.</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but the Sleepers of Arrakis are likely happier to hear about the changes coming to the endgame, particularly those who would rather engage with the PvE gameplay in Dune: Awakening, and don't want to be bothered with PvP.</p>
<p>Joel Bylos, creative director of Dune: Awakening at Funcom, released a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">statement</a> to players today, beginning by saying, "<em>Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in.</em>"</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc/app.bsky.feed.post/3lsbtlpe4cc27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidqbgaaa5jcymkui276dk4nsx2q676sgwze4j43pfsfgjrc5txqeq">
<p lang="en">The Deep Desert is evolving. PvE players will have more space to explore and progress without unwanted conflict. The Landsraad is getting more variety, better pacing, and stronger rewards.Check out the letter from our Creative Director to know more about our plans:bit.ly/Dune_Awakeni...</p>
<p>â€” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc?ref_src=embed">Dune: Awakening (@duneawakening.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc/post/3lsbtlpe4cc27?ref_src=embed">2025-06-23T14:54:25.908Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"<em>We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert - an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert. But as Stephen King says, 'Wish in one hand, shit in the other, see which one fills up first.' One of my hands is overflowing right now and sadly not with wishes.</em>"</p>
<p>Bylos goes on to describe how there have been many players complaining that their time with Dune: Awakening is ending prematurely, "<em>due to the extremely competitive nature of the Deep Desert</em>." So, beginning "<em>soon</em>," there will be areas of the Deep Desert that are flagged as&nbsp;<strong>Partial Warfare (PvE)</strong>, while the majority of the Deep Desert will still be flagged as&nbsp;<strong>War of Assassins</strong><strong> (PvP</strong><strong>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The new PvE areas of the Deep Desert will allow those solo, PvE-focused players to harvest endgame and T6 resources "<em>without the threat of conflict they may not want</em>."</p>
<p>Bylos still stipulates though that those solo players will still find it to be a grind if they go that route, as the game is "<em>balanced around guilds and groups</em>." He also clarifies that the PvP areas of the Deep Desert will still be where the best resources can be found, and that they will remain "<em>high reward, high risk areas</em>."</p>
<p>Other changes are coming to PvP play, specifically around scout ornithopters. In the next batch of changes, scout ornithopters with rocket launchers attached will have their speed maneuverability reduced, and rockets fired from scout ornithopters will generate more heat.</p>
<p>Scout ornithopters without rocket launchers and equipped with thrusters will have a max speed boost regardless of wings to ensure they remain the fastest ornithopters available, and a T5 infantry rocket launcher will be added "<em>to help improve the dynamics of vehicle/ground combat</em>."</p>
<p>There are also more changes coming to the Landsraad, as Bylos says the team is "<em>addressing some key flaws in the Landsraad design</em>," such as how stockpiling items is currently rewarded, despite that not being the studio's intention with how it wants the Landsraad to function.</p>
<p>Bylos ends his statement asking players to be patient as Funcom works to improve Dune: Awakening and build it in collaboration with players based on their feedback.</p>
<p>"<em>Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing. We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. Bear with us - our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy</em>."</p>
<p>The reaction from players to everything Bylos talked about in his statement has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1limep2/never_change_reddit/">unsurprisingly mixed</a>. Some think he's taking the game in the entirely wrong direction, and rug-pulling Dune: Awakening into an entirely different game. Others are rejoicing for the changes, thankful that they'll be able to take part in more endgame activities.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dune: Awakening hasn't even been out for a full month. It'll take time for it to evolve as the meta changes and <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/">new content is introduced</a>. And based on the fact that it has had an undeniably strong launch, it seems like Funcom is going to have the chance to evolve it for years to come.</p>

			<p>Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=9">worst-reviewed game of 2025 so far</a>, MindsEye, has reportedly begun the process of enacting mass layoffs, which could impact at least 100 employees.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN</a>, a source tells them that it's unclear how many employees will be let go, but the studio began a 45-day consultation period today, on June 23.</p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy has a main studio based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/consultation">UK law</a>, the 45-day consultation begins when a company plans "<em>100 or more redundancies.</em>" IGN adds that Build a Rocket Boy has approximately 300 employees in the UK and another 200 outside the UK. If only 100 people are let go, that's still one-fifth of the studio gone.</p>
<p>To say that MindsEye's launch has gone badly would be an understatement. There were a number of signs before the game launched that things wouldn't be great, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">unenthusiastic previews from content creators</a>, negative <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a> reviews from former and current staff that described a studio with deep internal turmoil, claims from one of the co-chief executive officers that there was someone paying people to <em>"<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">trash the game and the</a></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"> <em>studio</em>,"</a> and two seemingly prescient <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">chief executives who departed the studio a week before</a> the game launched.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game were out ahead of launch</a>, with retail stores breaking MindsEye's street date, and Build a Rocket Boy releasing a statement warning players that those copies were missing "<em>a major</em>" day-one patch, though it wasn't exactly convincing that the patch would fix the issues MindsEye has.</p>
<p>All of this made it no surprise that when MindsEye did eventually launch on June 10, it did so in a broken state. High-end PCs struggled to run the game at all <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">due to its technical issues</a>, while players on PS5<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/"> began requesting (and getting) refunds from PlayStation</a> due to the game's poor performance and false advertising, as it was claimed ahead of launch that MindsEye would run at 60 FPS on PS5 Pro. On all consoles, MindsEye is currently capped at 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Two days after the official launch date, the studio published a statement that it was "<em>heartbroken</em>" with how the launch had gone, seeing all the issues players were<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1lgs7j6/even_more_awful_hilarious_and_absolutely/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"> reporting</a> and the negative feedback the game had received. It promised a series of fixes, two of which have already been released, though even after those hotfixes went live, the technical testing wizards at Digital Foundry reported that MindsEye has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">"<em>abject technical performance</em>,"</a> even with the latest patch.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - How Bad Does It Get? - PS5/Pro/Xbox Series X|S DF Tech Review" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fw_hsVgdfE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy has yet to comment on the layoff reports, or release a new statement beyond its latest hotfix last week. The studio did also deny that it was <a href="https://x.com/buildarocketboy/status/1935040621124972727">using bots to reply positively to negative reviews</a>, a claim that was brought up after a few people online noticed some similar wording in posts claiming that MindsEye gave players <a href="https://x.com/MckKirk/status/1934880019353928189">"<em>goosebumps,</em>"</a> or that they had<a href="https://x.com/MikeChannell/status/1934689743574344094"> only experienced a few bugs, and that the game reminded them of Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear where MindsEye sits in the sales charts, but with layoffs already on the table, it's likely that it underperformed, to say the least, which brings into question whether Build a Rocket Boy will deliver on any of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">post-launch plans for MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>MindsEye's poor launch also brings into question what will happen with what was supposed to be Build a Rocket Boy's flagship product, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everywhere-a-new-game-by-ex-gta-producer-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2022/">Everywhere</a>. MindsEye was originally billed as a premium experience players <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/">could play within Everywhere</a>, which itself is meant to be this massive platform through which players could make their own creations and play games made by Build a Rocket Boy, similar to what Epic has built with Fortnite.</p>
<p>That plan was later changed, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hitman-maker-io-interactive-teams-with-build-a-rocket-boy-to-publish-mindseye/">MindsEye being a standalone release</a>, and Build a Rocket Boy having to put out a statement that Everywhere had not been "<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-future-of-gta-producers-everywhere-is-in-doubt-as-mindseye-adopts-its-creation-suite/"><em>abandoned</em></a>." Now, however, it could likely be abandoned, since we don't even know if Build a Rocket Boy will be around long enough to make it.</p>
<p>This is just speculation, but it seems like MindsEye was meant to be a sort of proof-of-concept for the creation platform that Build a Rocket Boy envisioned Everywhere to be. If MindsEye had been a massive success, that would be the foundation for building out Everywhere, and the ultimate showcase for what's possible in the platform Build a Rocket Boy were creating. You could say MindsEye's success was meant to be the fuel for the rocket that would be Everywhere.</p>
<p>If that was the plan, it seems fair to say that it has failed, at least for now. Who knows, this could still potentially be the beginning of MindsEye's own arc where Build a Rocket Boy patches it into an entirely different game, something that players actually like and want to play.</p>
<p>Or, these layoffs, should they be confirmed, could be the beginning of the story players are more familiar with, the one where, within a year's time, Build a Rocket Boy is another shuttered studio.</p>
