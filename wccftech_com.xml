			<p>Nintendo will live stream its Mario Kart World Direct tomorrow morning, <strong>April 17, 2025</strong>, at <strong>6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The direct was announced when Nintendo first showcased Mario Kart World during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> at the beginning of the month as the next chance we'd get to learn more about it. With the live stream placeholder now up on Nintendo's YouTube channel, we know that it will only be a 15-minute presentation in which Nintendo says we'll get an "<em>in-depth</em>" look at the new kart racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Nintendo shows in this direct, but, of course, we've seen a lot about Mario Kart World since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct earlier this month. A big part of the conversation has been around the fact that Mario Kart World is one of the few Nintendo Switch 2 games that will cost $80.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World is worth the increased price.</a> Bowser even highlighted tomorrow's direct, telling players with doubts to tune in and see what Nintendo shows off.</p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to</em> <em>discover</em>." Bowser told <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fmario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fswitch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=a8794423f20c06ce869d8877c3daa0d3&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">IGN</a>. "<em>And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.</em>"</p>
<p>Wccftech's own Nathan Birch had the chance to play Mario Kart World during a recent Nintendo event, and while he admits to having fun with the game, it also didn't blow him away. That said, there's still a lot of potential that can't be seen in a short 20-minute demo. We'll see how much tomorrow's 15-minute direct adds to that.</p>
<p>"<em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times."</em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">Birch wrote</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em>"</p>

			<p>Today marks the official launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-has-finally-been-launched-heres-where-you-can-get-it-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5060 Ti graphics card</a> (available in 8 and 16GB models), and NVIDIA has also released the related Game Ready driver (version 576.02).</p>
<p>The driver is also optimized for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-squad-no-more-room-in-hell-2-and-exfil-now-support-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new slate of NVIDIA DLSS 4 games</a>, chiefly Black Myth: Wukong. The highly successful game created by Game Science runs at nearly 250 frames per second on an RTX 5090 GPU with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode (output at 4K resolution) and full ray tracing enabled. The RTX 5080 stops at an average of 160 FPS, the RTX 5070 Ti at 138 FPS, and the RTX 5070 at 112 FPS.</p>
<p>This new Game Ready driver also adds support for 19 new G-SYNC Compatible displays and 6 new Optimal Playable Settings profiles for Deadlock, Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced, Half-Life 2 with RTX, inZOI, Monster Hunter Wilds, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>

			<p>The stunning NVIDIA Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo shown last month is now available for download, giving users the chance to experience neural rendering, which NVIDIA itself described as the future of graphics.</p>
<p>The new demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://dlss.download.nvidia.com/demos/zorah/ZorahSample_UE5_Source_1.0.0.7z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is powered by the NVIDIA RTX Unreal Engine 5 branch and features plenty of cutting-edge tech, so performance is likely to be unstable on the vast majority of system configurations. Still, it provides an early look at how next-generation games will look with enhanced real-time path tracing and every other improvement offered by Neural Rendering.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah | Neural Rendering, Powered by GeForce RTX 50 Series and AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtTtUyqGs-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA RTX Neural Rendering support in DirectX was announced last month during<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/"> GDC 2025</a>, when NVIDIA also provided an overview of how Neural Rendering can be used, such as RTX Neural Texture Compression, which can create a neural representation of thousands of textures in a very short time, saving up to seven times the VRAM and RAM compared to regular compression tech, and RTX Neural Radiance Cache, which can infer theoretically infinite multi-bounce indirect lighting from just one or two bounces to optimize performance and visuals.</p>
<p>More information on the RTX Neural Rendering features found in the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo can be found on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">NVIDIA's official website.</a></p>

			<p>A Monster Hunter Wilds mod called Tex Decompressor Tool is now available for download, significantly improving stuttering issues on a good number of system configurations.</p>
<p>The tool, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/951?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> and is fully compatible with the game's latest version, is used to create a patch pak with uncompressed textures, which can improve frame rate stability but will take up more disk space with both the regular textures and the ones included in the High Resolution texture pack. The process can be somewhat complicated, but Nexus Mods member <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/users/134767873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mox9291</a> provided a handy tutorial in the mod's comment section on how to use the tool and enjoy the more stable performance granted by the removal of the decompression step that can cause stuttering issues even on powerful systems.</p>
<p>As I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a> earlier this year, Monster Hunter Wilds is one of the best entries in the series, so much so that it's easy to look past some of its shortcomings. While the performance issues still have to be addressed, CAPCOM has started providing more challenging hunts this month with the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/">Title Update</a>, which introduced returning monster Mizustune and its Tempered variant as well as the high rank variant of campaign final boss Zoh Shia. Another challenging monster, Arch tempered Rey Dau, will be made available later this month, though PC hunters can use some <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mods-custom-quests-new-monster/">mods</a> to take on the new variant of the Apex predator right now.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The 8 nm chip powering the Nintendo Switch 2 may be a disappointing choice for some, but there's the chance that it has been chosen to allow the easy creation of upgraded system revisions based on node shrinks.</p>
<p>Speaking during their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> commented on the system's Samsung 8 nm chip, suggesting that it may have been picked not only for economic reasons, as Nintendo likely got a deal on a production line that is no longer producing that many chips, but also to keep the door open for hardware revisions based on node shrinks. A future console revision on a 5 nm class node, which also includes a 4 nm node, could do wonders for battery life, which leaves something to be desired in the launch system, as it is estimated to be 2 hours at minimum, half an hour less than the battery life of the launch original Switch model. A node shrink would also open the way for a portable-only Nintendo Switch 2 Lite, as battery life in such a system would be extremely important to make it an enticing purchase. Considering Nintendo would want to bundle all of its&nbsp;key tech improvements together, an OLED model will likely also follow with a node shrink.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch 2 Mid-Gen Refresh Potential: Are New OLED and Lite Models Possible?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nc0ieceoQKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Nintendo has always released hardware revisions for almost every one of its systems with only a few notable exceptions, there's little doubt that Nintendo Switch 2 revisions will be made at some point, so it will be very interesting to see if Digital Foundry's speculation ends up aligning with Nintendo's plans. For the time being, however, those who wish to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, besides other exclusives, have no choice but to purchase the only console model that is launching on<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/"> June 5th.</a></p>

			<p>While the rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster has finally been proven to be real, it will take some time to learn more about the Fallout 3 remaster that was revealed at the same time as the soon-to-be-released remaster.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remaster of the third entry in the series, which was revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing</a> besides the Oblivion remaster, saying that it will be a while before we see it, without providing any additional information. If Microsoft and Bethesda stick to the timeframes detailed back in 2023, we should be seeing more of the Fallout 3 remaster in around two years or so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It'll be a while before we see it.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1912227284511273452?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As already mentioned, the existence of a Fallout 3 remaster is essentially a given at this point, with the confirmation that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is real and possibly coming very soon. Following weeks of rumors and speculation, the first few screenshots of the remaster leaked online <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">yesterday</a> via the official website of the developer who was long rumored to be working on it, Virtuos. Unfortunately, we still don't know if the remaster will sport gameplay improvements besides the visual upgrade powered by Unreal Engine 5, but thankfully it won't be long to see if and how the experience will have been improved, as the remaster is said to be released next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Later this year, we'll also get the fan-made Oblivion-to-Skyrim port called Skyblivion, and the team lead has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the official remaster.</p>
