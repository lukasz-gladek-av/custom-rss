			<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/aion2-splitgate-arena-reloaded-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/">Another five games have received support</a> for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation this week, including Yakuza Kiwami 2, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and ARK: Lost Colony. Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-dying-light-the-beast-update-1-5-nightmare-experience/">Dying Light: The Beast</a> adds support for ray-tracing, Lost Ark added support for DLSS Super Resolution, and NVIDIA put out a new GeForce Ready game driver to support it all.</p>



<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">the return of Splitgate 2</a>, and the first Splitgate, as developer 1047 Games has opted to try and mash together the best of both games into one offering for players. It arrived as a free-to-play game on PC and consoles everywhere as of yesterday, December 17, and has support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to ensure that you can get the most out of your hardware. It's also the exact kind of game you'd want to play at the highest frame rate possible, as a competitive first-person shooter.</p>



<p>If you are playing it, that is. Splitgate 2's launch went very poorly, and, while SteamDB numbers are never the full picture, at least on PC, the release of Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#3m">doesn't seem to have turned things around</a> when looking at the concurrent player numbers.</p>



<p>For Yakuza Kiwami 2, a recent update to the game added DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation, and now, if you load it up alongside the NVIDIA app, you can boost your experience further with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation with the app's DLSS overrides.</p>



<p>MMORPG Ashes of Creation, which recently launched as a new early access title on PC, also did so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. Also, speaking of SteamDB numbers, it's one of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4124950/charts/">trending games on the platform at the time of this writing</a>. </p>



<p>ARK: Lost Colony and AION2 are the final two games to round out the five that are getting support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, with AION2 getting support on December 24, 2025, as part of a new update, and ARK: Lost Colony featuring support for DLSS 4 today as part of a new update.</p>



<p>Lastly, today's new GeForce Game Ready driver will ensure that you're able to jump into all of these games without issue, as it fixes a colour issue from the previous driver and several other bug fixes.</p>

			<p>A few weeks ago, the hopes of the Half-Life community were sparked by rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 is not only in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">active development</a></strong>, but also <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">in the polishing and optimization phase</a></strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/"><strong>close to an announcement.</strong></a> Now that we are so close to the holidays, however, it's unlikely that even a company like Valve that operates on its own set of rules will announce the project before the end of the year, as previously rumored.</p>



<p>The now-legendary game not being announced in 2025 has shattered the hopes of many, who no longer believe a new entry in the series will be released in the near future. However, the lack of an official announcement shouldn't make you lose hope, as the project rumored to be the third entry in the Valve series hasn't been abandoned. On the contrary, it has received a new update which is sure to spark new hope in fans.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV"><strong>Tyler McVicker</strong></a>, who has provided an in-depth look at the latest updates made to the HLX project found in the Source 2 engine in the past, the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-Dota2/commit/5688664efb6b3a0e6a52abec53f8d0d7990d1f71"><strong>Dota 2 December 16 2025 update</strong></a> introduced new strings of code directly related to the project rumored to be Half-Life 3.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Based on how the Half-Life community lately, should I even make a video detailing the dump of new information found in the latest DOTA 2 update? </p><p>I don't know...</p><p>I guess this game doesn't exist.... Oh well.... <a href="https://t.co/nFcNYv9ynt">pic.twitter.com/nFcNYv9ynt</a></p></div>— Tyler "Hype Merchant" McVicker (@Tyler_McV) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/2001331835373265408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While an in-depth explanation of what these new additions mean for the HLX project has yet to be provided, the community verified that these updates are real and confirmed on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">this comprehensive community-managed Miro board</strong></a> that they are related to the Animgraph 2 system, a new animation resolve system designed to replace the previous system, which caused large bandwidth consumption in multiplayer games. For those not interested in game development, these additions are still important to know about, as it is undeniable proof that the development of HLX is proceeding.</p>



<p>What these updates don't suggest, on the other hand, is when the HLX project will be officially revealed. According to rumors, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/">Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch game targeting a Spring 2026 release</a></strong>, so if these plans haven't changed, it shouldn't be long until we will finally learn if and how the iconic series by Valve will continue following the VR game <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-unveiled-next-month/"><strong>Half-Life: Alyx.</strong></a></p>
