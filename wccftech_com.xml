			<p>Almost immediately after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct had players excited about the new device and the new games revealed, a dark cloud took shape above that excitement with Donald Trump's announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">steep tariffs</a> imposed on countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the time since, there's been plenty of speculation as to how these tariffs will impact the cost of the console<span>. Nintendo even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed pre-orders for the console in the United States</a> from the original April 9, 2025 date&nbsp;</span>to "<em>assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.</em>"</p>
<p>That delay will now also impact Canada, as Nintendo confirmed to Canadian publication <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/">MobileSyrup</a> that pre-orders for the console have been delayed in Canada "<em>in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the U.S.,</em>" the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>"<em>Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date,</em>" the statement continued. "<em>The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged</em>."</p>
<p>It's unfortunate news for Canadians who thought they might've avoided the delay that their southern neighbors are dealing with, especially considering that they are only hearing it a day before pre-orders were meant to go live.</p>
<p>The fate of Canadian gamers' Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order hopes is now tied to that of United States gamers, whether they like it or not. In this case, it's safe to assume not.</p>

			<p>The PvPvE extraction RPG game from Wolcen Studio, currently known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/">Project Pantheon</a>, just got a new teaser trailer revealed along with the announcement that Wolcen Studio is hosting a second closed alpha test that interested players can now sign up for.</p>
<p>The test will only last for a little less than a day, beginning on <strong>Friday, April 25, 2025 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT</strong> and ending the next day on&nbsp;<strong>Saturday, April 26 at 2:59pm PT / 5:59pm ET / 10:59pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Those interested in joining the closed alpha to get an early taste of Project Pantheon can <a href="https://pantheon.firstlook.gg/">sign up for the play test at this link</a>.</p>
<p>If you already participated in the first closed-alpha test for Project Pantheon, you don't have to worry about signing up for this new one. You'll automatically be granted access to it. For everyone else, all you need to do is make sure to register your interest in the play test before <strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>There's a number of new features that play testers will be able to check out, including the player sanctuary now being a "<em>fully 3D navigable hub where players can customize gear, track achievements, and craft runes</em>," the studio says in a press release.</p>
<p>There's also a new dodge roll mechanic, new weapon and gear customizations, new weapons like a new magic weapon simply called "<em>The Staff</em>," new dungeons, a new monster faction to fight in t<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">he Hamförir, and a structured gameplay tutorial to help newcomers get the hang of things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Of course, there's also a slew of bug fixes<span>&nbsp;and new quality-of-life improvements. For example, a revamped health and shield system, abilities adjusted to feel&nbsp;<em>"snappier,</em>" according to Wolcen Studio, and the overall movement system </span>improved.</p>
<p>If you miss out on this closed alpha, Wolcen Studio currently has two more planned for Project Pantheon after this. The third closed alpha test will arrive sometime in summer 2025, with the fourth coming a bit later in the year in autumn.</p>
