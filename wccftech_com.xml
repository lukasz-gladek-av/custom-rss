			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is off to an incredible start, selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">3.5 million units globally</a> in just its first four days on the market.</p>
<p>Nintendo is selling as many Switch 2 units as it can make, but the massive hardware launch doesn't seem to translate to huge game sales, at least for non-Nintendo games. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">The Game Business</a> reports that in the US, 62% of physical game sales for the Nintendo Switch 2 were for first-party Nintendo games, not including Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>In the UK, once again without including Mario Kart World, 48% of physical game sales were first-party Nintendo games, and with Mario Kart World included in those sales, that number bumps up to 86% of physical game sales going to first-party, Nintendo-made titles. Though you might think this leaves out a big piece of the picture by only focusing on physical sales, in cases where games were available digitally and physically, "<em>over 80% of Switch 2 game sales came from physical retailers,</em>" according to data shared by publishers to The Game Business.</p>
<p>A third-party publisher also told The Game Business that their sales numbers were "<em>below our lowest estimates</em>" for what they expected to sell on the Switch 2. The only third-party game that seems to have had great success on the Switch 2 so far is Cyberpunk 2077, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/">Circana reported was the third best-selling game in the US</a> during the Switch 2's launch week.</p>
<p>So, at least on a global scale, it looks like third-party publishers aren't having the best time on Switch 2, with first-party Nintendo games swallowing up all the attention. But at least regionally, according to Circana analyst and executive director Mat Piscatella, third-party game sales for Switch 2 games are doing much better than they were compared to the Switch 1's launch.</p>
<p>"<em>Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 just reached shy of 40%</em>," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzjgdngs2t">Piscatella writes on BlueSky</a>. "<em>For month 1 of the Switch launch it was less than 20%.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's far too early to claim best or worst this or that or whatever when it comes to Switch 2</em>."</p>

<p lang="en">Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%. For month 1 of the Switch launch it was less than 20%.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t?ref_src=embed">2025-06-19T17:15:19.742Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As Piscatella also points out, the Switch 2 has not even been out for a month. We'll have a better look at sales numbers in due time, and there are also plenty of other factors to consider.</p>
<p>For example, the number of Switch's available at launch in 2017 is nowhere close to the number of units Nintendo was prepared with for the Switch 2's launch. There are simply more consoles out in the wild, for people to buy games on.</p>
<p>And that's before getting into the fact that people buy Nintendo consoles to play Nintendo games. It's only with the Switch that third-party publishers saw more success on the platform. Piscatella also pointed out in a separate post that as of March 2025, "<em>approximately half of all US owners of either the PS5 or Xbox Series also owned a Switch.</em>"</p>
<p>Someone who has never played Cyberpunk 2077 because they don't have a console or PC to play it on is more likely to buy it now that it's on Switch 2 than someone who bought their Switch 2 to play Mario Kart, and already played Cyberpunk on their current-gen console or high-end PC, and that goes for all third-party titles that are essentially ports to the Switch 2 for games that couldn't run on the Switch.</p>
<p>Again, as Piscatella pointed out, it's far too early to really say how third-party games will perform on the Switch 2. With the new hardware being capable of more 'impossible ports' like the Witcher 3 running on the original Switch, and more new games potentially releasing on Switch 2 alongside PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions, the Switch 2 could still be a good platform for third-party games to thrive.</p>
<p>Though, seemingly that's contingent on whether Nintendo has a new Mario game out for the console at the same time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/techland-would-love-to-bring-dying-light-the-beast-to-the-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During our <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest 2025 interview with Tymon Smektała</a>, we asked the Techland Dying Light Franchise Director whether there were any plans to bring Dying Light: The Beast to the Nintendo Switch 2 console. Without promising anything, Smektała was very open about his desire to do it at some stage:</p>
<p><em>I would love this to happen at some point, but nothing to announce at this time.</em></p>
<p>On one hand, Techland's Director has detailed several technical improvements made to the C-Engine for Dying Light: The Beast:</p>
<p><em>We have also improved the visuals a lot. Our in-house C-Engine engine went through a number of iterations. Now, all the weather effects, the rendering of materials, lighting, shadows, and how the sun moves in the sky. All of those things are on a completely different level compared to Dying Light 2: Stay Human.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, the game is one of the very few to be still targeting a launch on old-generation consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) in 2025. As such, there's little doubt that the Nintendo Switch 2 could run the game in terms of raw power. It's rather a matter of opportunity, then. With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch sales</a> it's had so far, it would seem like a no-brainer to bring a game to Nintendo's console, but that doesn't mean it would be easy for the Polish developer.</p>
<p>The first Dying Light only launched on the Switch six and a half years after the game's original debut in 2015. It took the opportunity to gather all DLCs into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-platinum-edition-leaked-due-on-thursday-may-27th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platinum Edition</a> that launched everywhere and added the Switch version. Whether Techland plans to do the same for this 'unofficial third game' remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dying Light 2: Stay Human was announced to be coming to the original Nintendo Switch through a cloud version that, however, never materialized.</p>

			<p>Bandai Namco has announced it will host a Little Nightmares Showcase for next week on <strong>June 24, 2025, at 12pm PST / 5pm EST / 8pm BST</strong>.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a short post to the <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">Little Nightmares III official X account</a>, with a short video clip showing the date and time of the showcase and the caption "<em>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think. Are you ready to face it, little ones?</em>"</p>
<p>That's all Bandai shared about the showcase, though we can infer that it'll include good deal of information on the next entry in the Little Nightmares series, Little Nightmares III, which is still without an official release date after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gets-delayed-to-2025/">delayed last year</a> and pushed into 2025.</p>
<p>Though a release date hasn't been officially confirmed, a product listing for Little Nightmares III on Target (spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/539541/article/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-potentially-leaked/">Gameranx</a>) has the release date set for September 15, 2025. We'll find out next week if that leak was correct.</p>
<p>It'll also be interesting to see more of Little Nightmares III, as this is the first game in the series that isn't being developed by the series creators at Tarsier Studios. Supermassive Games has taken over the series, and while the initial clips and previews suggest that it'll stay very close to the kind of game Tarsier already established, Supermassive will undoubtedly bring their own flair to the games in some way.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gamescom-hand-on-preview-surviving-together/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo previewed the game at Gamescom 2024,</a> he wrote that from the top of the demo, "<em>there was no doubt that I was playing a Little Nightmares game. Everything was in the right place: the characters, the atmosphere, the tone, and the gameplay</em>."</p>
<p>So far, some of the key differences seem to be that the characters in Little Nightmares III can use a series of weapons, but no doubt, there are more changes yet to be revealed, even if it's all staying close to what we all know to be a Little Nightmares game.</p>
