			<p>Red Dead Redemption may be coming soon to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a fresh finding.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the ESRB posted <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">a new rating</a> for the classic Old West open-world game developed by Rockstar Games for the Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo current-generation systems. <span>The rating is unsurprisingly identical to the ones of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39915/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PC</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39512/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PlayStation 4,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39439/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;ports, an M for Mature 17+ due to the presence of blood and gore, intense violence, nudity, strong language, and more.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-a-new-port-of-red-dead-redemption">What's The Point of a New Port of Red Dead Redemption?</h2>



<p>Today's rating is somewhat surprising as Red Dead Redemption is already playable on all three systems via backward compatibility. As such, a new native release for current-generation systems can only mean that some new technical features should be included. In regard to content, no surprise should be expected due to the rating summary being identical across all versions of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-red-dead-redemption-be-improved-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-and-xbox-series-x-s">How Can Red Dead Redemption Be Improved on PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The new Red Dead Redemption console ports may finally offer 60 FPS and beyond gameplay on all systems.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the game can be played on current-generation consoles via backward compatibility, the experience may not be the best for the most demanding players, as 60 FPS gameplay is only available on PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>PlayStation 4</th><th>Nintendo Switch</th><th>Xbox Series X|S</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1080p (PS4), upscaled to 4K on PS5</td><td>1080p docked / 720p handheld</td><td>1440p on Series S<br>Native 4K on Series X</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 FPS (locked), 60 FPS on PlayStation 5</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance Enhancements</strong></td><td>Stable frame pacing, improved texture filtering</td><td>Optimized for handheld and docked play</td><td>Enhanced resolution, improved filtering, Auto-HDR</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">PC port of Red Dead Redemption, on the other hand, is the most advanced</a>, offering up to 144 FPS gameplay, among other improvements that set it decisively above every other version of the game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Red Dead Redemption PC Port Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution Support</strong></td><td>Up to native 4K resolution and ultrawide monitor support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>Up to 144 FPS support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics Enhancements</strong></td><td>Improved textures, enhanced shadows, updated anti-aliasing, higher draw distance, and overall graphical refinements, HDR 10 support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other Features</strong></td><td>NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.0, DLSS Frame Generation Support</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Considering the PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S have the horsepower to run what's basically an enhanced port of a PS3, Xbox 360 era game at high resolution and framerates, it's very likely the new Red Dead Redemption console ports will attempt to reach parity with the PC version in this regard. </p>



<p>Hopefully, a few more surprises will also be included in this new port, but even without any, improved resolution and framerates should be more than enough to make Red Dead Redemption an enjoyable experience on modern consoles.</p>

			<p>It's been two years since Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced the Steam Deck OLED</a>, a revision of the handheld gaming device originally released on the market in February 2022. Back then, fans of the device had already been clamoring for a proper, more powerful new iteration, but Valve had just <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-might-not-arrive-until-2025-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that a Steam Deck 2 wouldn't be released until 2025 or 2026 because the technology they were looking for <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-0-doesnt-exist-because-technology-is-not-there-yet-valve-is-working-on-games-designed-for-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was simply not yet available</a>.</p>



<p>The Steam hardware family is officially set to expand early next year with the launch of the Frame headset, the new Steam Machine, and the new Steam Controller; however, there's no new Deck in sight yet. IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked Valve once again</a>, and Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais reiterated that it still isn't time yet, although the company now has a good idea of what it's going to be. </p>



<p><em>Obviously the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck… the thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product. We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that. So we've been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SOC landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck. </em></p>



<p>It sounds like we'll have to wait until the latter half of 2027, in all likelihood, which could put the new Deck in direct competition with the PlayStation handheld that Sony is working on. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it's expected to offer a performance level similar to the base PlayStation 5 console. </p>



<p>Given that both devices will be powered by AMD technology, they could end up with similar performance if they are released near each other at a comparable price. Of course, there are too many unknowns at this point, which is expected given that these devices are a couple of years away. Still, keep following Wccftech to remain updated on the latest leaks, rumors, and news.</p>
