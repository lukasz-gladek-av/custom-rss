			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has delved into the changes coming in the Season 3.5 update, showcasing the latest addition to the game's roster, Blade, changes to character team-ups, a new map, a new game mode, new features to help catch and penalize toxic players, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the new features, like Blade and NetEase's new monitoring of voice chat in matches and reviews of muted words, will arrive with the update on August 8, 2025. The new game mode, Resource Rumble, and the new map that it's introducing, Throne of Knull, won't arrive until a later update on August 22, 2025.</p>

<p>Regarding the team-up changes, two are being removed from play entirely: Guardian Revival and Atlas Bond. Loki is the only character who is being removed from a team-up, as Ragnarok Rebirth will now be a Hela/Thor team-up. Two new team-ups are being introduced, Duality Dance, which includes Adam Warlock and Luna Snow, and Vibrant Vitality, which includes Mantis and Groot/Loki.</p>



<p>Iron Fist will join the Chilling Assault team-up, and Star-Lord will join the Rocket Network team-up. Blade, as the new kid on the block, will join the Lunar Force team-up with Moon Knight and Cloak &amp; Dagger.</p>

<p>Beyond NetEase monitoring voice chat more closely and a custom filter for text chat to filter out muted words, the studio is also introducing harsher penalties for players who leave competitive matches. Players who quit competitive matches early will receive longer bans and larger point deductions, while the players who have to stick it out with a handicap thanks to their former teammate quitting will be offered point compensation when the match is over. </p>



<p>If you get booted from the match through no fault of your own, like losing a connection or your system crashing, NetEase promises to review mistaken bans and appeals faster, so players aren't wrongly sidelined. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals was one of the biggest games at the top of the year, and while its active player base (on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#max">Steam</a>, at least) has declined from the heights it was hitting in January, it still has tens of thousands of players each day. As NetEase continues to update and add to the game, it'll be interesting to see if it is able to repeat, or even surpass its launch numbers, with future changes and updates.</p>



<p>After all, a strong launch for a free-to-play live service game is a great thing, but the sign of a healthy live-service game is being able to leapfrog those launch numbers with a new update, something Marvel Rivals has not yet done.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-will-host-an-open-beta-for-battlefield-6-in-august-dates-revealed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1257429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA will reportedly host an open beta for Battlefield 6 in August, potentially even two open betas, the first at the beginning of the month and the second one later in the month.</p>



<p>This claim comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta/">Insider-Gaming</a>, which claims from its sources that access to a closed beta can be gained through a promotion with several content creators who will be giving away codes on Twitch. Insider-Gaming also claims that following the closed beta on August 7-8, the beta will continue until August 10th in an "<em>open-beta phase</em>," though that is seemingly separate from an open beta later in the month from August 14-17.</p>



<p>Shortly after Insider-Gaming's report, however, in the official Battlefield Discord server, EA's global community manager denied the claim that there was a closed beta at all, confirming that only an open beta is planned. Perhaps Insider-Gaming's wires were crossed, and there are two open betas planned. Either way, we'll likely know for sure tomorrow.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We got our first official look at Battlefield 6 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/">last week</a>, with its debut trailer showing what looked more like cutscenes from various points of the game's campaign rather than gameplay. Last week's announcement also confirmed that we'll get a gameplay trailer for multiplayer tomorrow, July 31, 2025, which is likely where we'll find out if Insider-Gaming and its sources are correct about the beta dates. </p>

<p>While there's definitely a lot riding on the campaign for Battlefield 6, its multiplayer is what will decide if the game lives or dies. It took EA months to undo the mistakes and damage it did to Battlefield 2042's multiplayer, which was unfortunately the only mode 2042 had since it lacked a campaign.</p>



<p>EA has a lot riding on Battlefield 6, with four of its core studios working on it and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">hundreds of millions reportedly invested </a>into its development. We'll see how players respond to tomorrow's gameplay trailer, and if Battlefield 6 will have the legs EA is expecting it to have.</p>
