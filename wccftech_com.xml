			<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 has been long considered among the finest character action games ever released, but a complete newcomer to the series will hardly feel the same when playing any of the game's iterations, including the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>. The game developed by Team NINJA is unlike action games from other studios like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, as it is a game that pushes players to play as optimally as possible, not just to hit high scores as in the Bayonetta series but to actually survive combat encounters, which can get hectic fast.</p>
<p>As such, the best way to understand the brilliance of the Ninja Gaiden 2 Black experience is to learn and master the game, starting with some essential techniques that will help you during your first playthrough and teach you how to handle the game's many challenges to take on higher difficulty settings.</p>
<h2>Stand Your Ground</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250127184908_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike other action games, blocking in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is an extremely powerful defensive technique that is way more effective than dodging in the vast majority of combat scenarios. As such, don't hesitate to keep the block button pushed down as enemies come at you, as you will be able to negate all damage safely. Sometimes, your guard may be broken, but you can easily avoid damage by pushing the left stick in the direction you want to dodge. Blocking will also become available as soon as the dodging animation is complete, allowing you to continue negating damage.</p>
<p>By just defending, however, you aren't going to defeat your enemies, so you should use blocking to learn enemy patterns and unleash combos and special techniques when it is safe to do so. Think of offense and defense in Ninja Gaiden 2 as in a fighting game, where some moves are safe on block and some aren't.</p>
<h2>Master Flying Swallow and Izuna Drop</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135242_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While each weapon has tons of combos and special techniques, which are further expanded with upgrades, there are some techniques that are absolutely essential to master. The first one is the Flying Swallow, a special aerial attack that can be used by jumping and pressing heavy attack and a direction to safely attack enemies and quickly reposition if needed. The second one is the iconic Izuna Drop, which is unleashed with select weapons by launching an enemy in the air and hitting them with three light attacks and one heavy attack. What makes this technique so useful is the fact that it instantly kills enemies.</p>
<p>The best thing about these two techniques is that they are available for use right from the very beginning of the game, as it is possible to perform them with Ryu's starting weapon, the Dragon Sword. They can be used with other weapons as well, so experiment with them to find which works best for you.</p>
<h2>Take Advantage of Ninpo Spells' Invincibility</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135610_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninpo Spells are another important part of Ryu Hayabusa's arsenal in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, as they can be used to unleash some rather powerful attacks. What makes them more useful than they may look at a glance is the invincibility some of them grant before the spell goes off. Use this invincibility window to get some heat off of you.</p>
<h2>Learn When to Use Ultimate Techniques Properly</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135327_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimate Techniques are among the least used combat techniques in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black by beginners, as they can be difficult to use properly with little knowledge of enemies' patterns and abilities as they require charging. However, you really should learn how to use them properly if you want to truly master the game, as they are extremely powerful and they can clear enemy groups in very little time.</p>
<p>The best way to use Ultimate Techniques properly is to start charging them when there's Essence floating around, which speeds up the charging process considerably once absorbed. As such, you will want to not absorb the resource right after an enemy is defeated, and there are two ways to do this: you either keep yourself away from it as much as possible, or you keep blocking. Position yourself properly by jumping and then blocking as soon as you land, start charging your Ultimate Attack, and watch your enemies explode in a glorious, gory mess.</p>
<h2>Watch and Adapt</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250129191059_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite the general high speed of the experience, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black wants players to really look at enemies and not just to learn their attack patterns. After dealing some damage, Ryu may cut limbs from enemies, which not only limits their abilities, although they get access to desperate and damaging new attacks,&nbsp; but makes them susceptible to dismemberment, which can be accomplished by hitting them with a heavy attack. Given how important it is to reduce enemy numbers as quickly as possible, always keep an eye on the enemy's current state, and unleash insta-kill attacks as soon as possible!</p>

			<p>Exploring the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth open world has become more immersive than ever, thanks to a newly released first-person view mod.</p>
<p>This new mod, which was developed by S3ik3n and can now be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/232?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, allows players to explore the open world with a first-person camera view, with the camera automatically reverting to third-person during combat to maintain playability. Unfortunately, it is not possible to play the entirety of the game in first person, even outside combat, as there are times the camera will revert to third person in certain areas. Still, this is a great mod for those looking for increased immersion, as highlighted by the screenshots below.</p>

<p>While the modding scene continues to grow with the development of plenty of mods that introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/">new features</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/">enhance visuals</a>, Square Enix is also working on improving the PC port of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which launched in a much better state than the Remake port, but it's still far from being as good as it should have been. This week, the game received its<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-1-001-patch-direct-storage/"> first patch</a>, which improved game stability and updated DirectStorage to the latest version.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-battlefield-will-be-released-during-fiscal-year-2026-ea-confirms.1100670/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/next-battlefield-fiscal-year-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next Battlefield game could be released as soon as this year, as publisher EA has recently confirmed the release window of the yet-to-be-named new entry in the series.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings results report for the third quarter of FY2025</a>, EA confirmed that the game will be released during the fiscal year 2026, which begins on April 1st, 2025, and ends on March 31st, 2026, so there's a solid chance it will be released before the end of the year. As the latest new main entries in the franchise have been launched in either October or November, EA is likely pinning for a late 2025 release for the next Battlefield as well, although it will probably take a few months to learn if the next entry in the series will be following what has become the franchise's tradition at this point.</p>
<p>While very little is currently known about the next Battlefield, it was made clear earlier this week that EA is determined to make its launch as good as possible. A few days back, the publisher unveiled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-testing-environment-announced-first-pre-alpha-footage-of-next-entry-in-the-series-shown-in-new-video/">Battlefield Labs</a>, a new testing environment that will allow the massive development team, which includes series' creator DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion, to quickly gather community feedback and improve the game as much as possible ahead of launch. More information on the new community testing environment can be found on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>Today, CAPCOM released a free Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark that allows PC users to gauge how the full game will run on their configurations. The benchmark<span>, which weighs 24.8 GB, can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a></span>. As usual for CAPCOM benchmarks, the user will be presented with a score at the end of the benchmarking; the developers have shared a table to outline the various score ranges.</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th scope="col">Score</th>
<th scope="col">Details</th>

<p>The benchmark is fairly long, featuring a mix of cutscenes and open world gameplay (though not combat). Unsurprisingly, the frame rate is higher during cutscenes.</p>
<p>I tested it at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLAA enabled, and all settings (ray tracing included) set to max, as befitting the most powerful PC configuration currently available (Ryzen 7 9800X3D + <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>), and got a score of 21896 and an average frame rate of 127.98 frames per second. This is with the standard NVIDIA DLSS CNN model and x2 Frame Generation, as the game does not support DLSS 4 and/or Multi Frame Generation for the time being.</p>

<p>CAPCOM also shared updated PC requirements for each of the four graphics presets available in Monster Hunter Wilds. Using the high-resolution texture pack will require a graphics card with at least 16GB of VRAM.</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard received strong reviews (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own</a>), but it failed to meet publisher Electronic Arts's sales expectations. This resulted in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job cuts at developer BioWare</a>, which now <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly has under a hundred staff members</a>, a worrying prospect for their upcoming Mass Effect project.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Q3 2025 earnings call, Electronic Arts finally&nbsp;<span>discussed the launch's commercial failure. In a statement (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/electronic-arts-ea-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcript via Fool.com</a>), CEO Andrew Wilson outlined that it was a high-quality game that</span>&nbsp;failed to captivate a large audience, partly because players 'increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement.'</p>
<p><em>Our blockbuster storytelling strategy is built on three strategic objectives: first, create an authentic story experience for the core audience; second, build innovative groundbreaking features; and third, emphasize high-quality launches across both PC and console. In order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demand of players who increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category. Dragon Age: The Veilguard had a high-quality launch and was well-reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.</em></p>
<p>Later in the earnings call, Stuart Canfield, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Electronic Arts, added:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed, highlighting the competitive dynamics of the single-player RPG market. [...] Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players. The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources toward our most significant and highest potential opportunities.</em></p>
<p>The latter sentence is certainly worrying for fans of blockbuster single player games. It sounds like Electronic Arts might once again veer toward live service, and their previous attempts (like Anthem) were far from memorable. Still, the studio does have at least three single player games in production: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iron Man game</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Panther game</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final entry in the Star Wars Jedi series</a>.</p>
