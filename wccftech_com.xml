			<p>Although WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike game through and through, the hardcore action role-playing game developed by Leenzee Games twists some of the formula's mechanics to offer something unique. Among these twisted mechanics are the block and parry mechanics, which work quite differently from what you may be used to.</p>



<p>Besides dodging, which you should master as soon as possible, as it is the best way to get the Skyborn Might resource used to use special skills like Discipline Skills and magic spells, you have no other defensive mechanics as you begin your journey to find a cure for the Feathering affliction. <strong>To block or parry an attack, you will have to make some progress in the game.</strong></p>

<p><strong>To block enemy attacks </strong>in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, you will need to find axes, as these heavy weapons are the only ones that can block. After equipping one, all you need to do to<strong> </strong>block an enemy attack is hold the L2 button on a PlayStation controller or the Left Trigger on an Xbox controller. Blocking will not completely negate damage, but it's still a solid defensive option as it doesn't require any particular timing to use.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Deflection requires great timing in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, but those who master it are mightily rewarded</figcaption></figure>



<p>Parrying enemy attacks in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a little more complex, as you get two different options to do so: <strong>Deflects and Clashes</strong>. Deflecting attacks requires you to learn a specific Discipline Skill available for Longswords, Dual Blades, and Spears, and to press the button usually used for blocking with Axe, so L2/ Left Trigger, at the exact time an enemy attack connects with Wuchang. A successful deflection completely nullifies the attack.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Clashing in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is a great way to mitigate damage while attacking enemies</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Clashes</strong>, on the other hand, fit perfectly with the always-on-the-offense strategy you should often employ in WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers. Instead of pressing the block button at the same time an enemy attack connects, to perform a clash, one of your attacks has to connect with the enemy's weapon, deflecting most of the incoming damage. Like for Deflection, you will have to learn certain skills on the Impetus Repository to add clashing properties to regular light attacks and to charged light attacks. Though damage is not negated with clashing, the timing is a little more forgiving than Deflection skills, so it's still a viable option to use, especially if you know enemy tendencies well and want to stay on the offensive as much as possible.</p>
