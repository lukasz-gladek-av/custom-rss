			<p>Stellar Blade's PC launch has been a smashing success, as the game has been confirmed to be the fastest- selling Korean game on the platform.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://t.co/CkPC5KqbI6">financial report </a>for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, Shift Up reported an all-time best performance since the founding of the company, with an operating revenue of 112bn KRW and an operating profit of 68bn KRW. Much of this record-breaking performance is thanks to Stellar Blade, as 58% of the quarterly revenue was from the action RPG. By all metrics, the game continues to be successful even one year after its debut on PlayStation 5, as the game is the fastest-selling Korean game on Steam with <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">1 million units sold in three days</a>, and a total of 3 million sales across PC and console. The nearly 200,000 concurrent users peak on Steam also confirms the game's commercial success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">beating every other flasgship AAA games published by Sony</a>, including Ghost of Tsushima (77K peak Steam CCU), God of War (73K), Spider-Man (66K), Horizon: Zero Dawn (57K), and The Last of Us Part 1 (37K).</p>



<p>Seeing how Stellar Blade continues to be successful, it's not surprising to see Shift Up continuing to support it on both PC and PlayStation 5. Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-1-3-0-pc-patch-amd-fsr/">a new patch</a> went live on all formats, introducing improvements and bug fixes for a more enjoyable experience.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5, and may hit Nintendo Switch 2 at some point in the future.

			<p>This morning, Finnish developer Remedy Games <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> the half-year financial report, admitting that FBC: Firebreak did not perform well. We already knew that, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-has-surpassed-1-million-players-though-remedy-knows-theres-a-lot-of-work-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of one million players</a> was highly misleading since the game was available on both Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus to the respective subscribers.</p>



<p>Indeed, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said that the majority of the players were on those two platforms, whereas the Steam launch 'underperformed' compared to the studio's hopes:</p>



<p><em>The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.</em></p>



<p><em>Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.</em></p>



<p>With that being said, it was not all doom-and-gloom from the Remedy executive, who noted that FBC: Firebreak was always meant to be a live, evolving game. The studio now thinks it has a solid foundation to expand on, with the next major update scheduled to go live in late September.</p>



<p>On the bright side, Control's lifetime sales have now surpassed five million units. Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained full control of its publishing, distribution, and marketing rights in February 2024</a>, so the sales now go only to the Finnish developer. Alan Wake 2 continues to sell 'steadily' and accrue royalties, according to Virtala, who then switched to an update on the studio's upcoming projects.</p>



<p>Control 2 (which is being made <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a smaller budget than Alan Wake 2</a>) is on track to meet its next milestones, which will be focused on gameplay, environments, and missions. The studio wants the game to have a strong commercial offering when it launches. The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake also made steady progress; during the last quarter, Remedy built on the momentum established earlier in 2025 while collaborating closely with IP owner Rockstar Games. </p>
