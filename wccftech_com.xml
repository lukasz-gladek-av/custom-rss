            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest in today's whirlwind of Microsoft and Xbox-related news is a rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-feels-great-about-xboxs-2025-slate-of-games-with-more-unannounced-titles-to-come/">Phil Spencer</a>, the current chief executive officer of Microsoft's Gaming division will retire following the launch of Xbox's next-gen console. Sarah Bond, who is currently the head of Xbox at Microsoft, is rumored to take his place.</p>



<div><p>This claim comes from <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190">TheGhostOfHope on X</a>, an account that has previously been accurate regarding Call of Duty news. It's also been slightly corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retiring-xbox-next-gen/">Insider-Gaming</a>, who claims that Spencer's retirement in the near future is something they have also heard multiple times this year. That said, Phil Spencer is currently 57 years old. He's worked at Microsoft in one form or another since 1988 and joined the Xbox team in 2001. He's been at the head of Xbox since 2014, and in 2022, he was made the chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming. </p><p>He's climbed the ladder as far as he could, and is near retirement age. That he has one foot out the door isn't the greatest bit of speculation, but it's also not a surprise that this claim would come on the day when there are many changes being announced internally at Microsoft and in its gaming division, even beyond what we've already heard about.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE: Phil Spencer will be retiring from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after the launch of the next generation Xbox.</p><p>Phil Spencer is working closely with Sarah Bond and her team to ensure a smooth transition for her take over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming once he… <a href="https://t.co/LDqB4BW8ER">pic.twitter.com/LDqB4BW8ER</a></p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Spencer took charge of Xbox after the man he replaced, Dom Mattrick, left a mess of a console launch for him to clean up with the abysmal start to the Xbox One generation. He brought the platform back into the spotlight for positive reasons with his championing of Xbox Game Pass, a service that carried the moniker of 'the best deal in gaming' for years.</p>



<p>More recently, his legacy has been the massive acquisitions he's helped secure, of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-acquired-bethesda-and-all-its-ips-from-elder-scrolls-to-doom/">ZeniMax and Bethesda</a>, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">Activision Blizzard King</a>, though what people will remember of those acquisitions are the mass layoffs that followed them, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">today's massive cuts</a>. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Spencer's retirement is more of a question of when, not if. We've been hearing rumors about <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/">Xbox's next-gen hardware</a> for some time now, and we know that there's an <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox-branded ROG Ally handheld</a> coming at the end of this year. It could be the case that Spencer's retirement will come after the ROG Xbox Ally is out. It could also be that he'll step down after the next proper Xbox console is out. Either way, it seems clear that his time at Microsoft is winding down.</p>

<p>We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/">interviewed</a> Everstone Studio in September 2022, learning that there would be separate single player and multiplayer modes in Where Winds Meet. Indeed, now the developers have confirmed that there are some MMO-style features, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Build or join a Guild to unlock a wide range of group activities—from intense guild wars to challenging multiplayer dungeons and epic raids. </em></li>



<li><em>Prove your might in competitive duels, or step into a shared, ever-evolving world with thousands of fellow adventurers.</em></li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-cancelled-developer-the-initiative-shut-down-as-part-of-microsoft%E2%80%99s-layoffs.1234302/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative">Windows Central</a>, which has been corroborated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsypjg3yg22e">Bloomberg</a>, the latest casualty from Microsoft's massive 9,000+ employee layoff today is Xbox Game Studios team The Initiative, a team that was founded for the purpose of making a new Perfect Dark game. That Perfect Dark game is now cancelled, and The Initiative has been shuttered.</p>



<p>Windows Central had previously hinted towards this while reporting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG had been cancelled</a>, but has now confirmed the news after obtaining an email from Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. Booty's memo also confirms what had already been reported around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild being cancelled</a>, and adds that "<em>several unannounced projects</em>" have also been cancelled as part of today's layoffs. </p>



<div><p>"<em>Following Phil's note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units</em>," Booty begins, referencing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">an email sent out from Microsoft Gaming chief executive officer, Phil Spencer</a>.</p><p>"<em>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment</em>. <em>Our portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</em></p><p><em>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams. To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead</em>."</p></div>



<p>The cancellation of Perfect Dark also brings an end to the partnership Xbox had with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-being-available-for-perfect-dark-was-too-precious-of-a-resource-to-pass-on-says-xgs-head/">Crystal Dynamics,</a> who was working on the project alongside The Initiative.</p>



<p>Players who grew up with the first Xbox consoles recognize Perfect Dark as one of the series that helped make the Xbox a household name. While the last official Perfect Dark outing failed to impress, the excitement around its reboot could not have been higher for fans. The Initiative was described as a team of industry veterans, all excited to bring back the beloved stealth series. We even got to see some fairly impressive gameplay last year, seemingly indicating that the game was progressing well and that we'd see it on shelves within the next two years.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Now, we'll never know what the final product would have looked like, as the failings of Microsoft's executive branch continue to devastate thousands of people across the video game industry.</p>



<p>While there have already been major cuts confirmed today, more are still inbound. Forza Motorsport studio, Turn10, has<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l"> reportedly lost 50% of its staff,</a> and several Call of Duty studios, including Raven Software, have also suffered layoffs as part of today's cuts. We'll continue to update our stories and report on the cuts as more details are confirmed.</p>
