            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite the use of AI in video games and creative work being one of the hottest debated ethical topics among enthusiasts, consumers generally remain indifferent, according to a former Square Enix executive.</p>



<p>Jacob Navok, Genvid CEO and former Director of Business at Square Enix Holdings, <a href="https://x.com/JNavok">recently chimed in on the debate via X</a>, providing compelling evidence for why this consumer indifference is driving industry change.</p>



<p>Navok cited the success of the Roblox title Steal a Brainrot as a prime example. The game, which features 3D models based on AI slop characters, has been a massive hit among Gen Z gamers, reaching a peak of approximately 30 million concurrent players. This massive popularity signals that the current generation of young gamers doesn't care about the matter, and future generations of gamers will care even less. As Navok put it, quoting <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Dark Knight Rises</em>: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"You merely adopted the slop, I was born in it."</em></p>



<p>With the general consumer base largely uninterested in the matter, AI usage in video games is expected to increase significantly. The former Square Enix executive noted that many studios are already using AI generation in the concept phase, and many others are using tools like Claude for code, suggesting it will soon be hard to find an indie studio that isn't leveraging these tools.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For all the anti-AI sentiment we're seeing in various articles, it appears consumers generally do not care.</p><p>The biggest game of the year, Steal a Brainrot, had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents, and is named after/based on AI slop characters. (All… <a href="https://t.co/B3mexTjBcK">https://t.co/B3mexTjBcK</a></p></div>— Jacob Navok (@JNavok) <a href="https://twitter.com/JNavok/status/1990136368757186996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While most consumers, especially the younger generation, may not care about AI, how it is used makes all the difference in terms of quality, but perhaps not in terms of sales and revenue.</p>



<p>For instance, Embark Studios utilized AI to enhance the player experience in ARC Raiders by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">generating additional voice lines while ethically compensating voice actors for their voices to serve as the source material</a>. However, while this represents high-quality integration, it may not outperform the AI slop model in terms of scale. Navok notes that the Roblox game is set to earn significantly more money for longer, making between $80 and $90 million since its release and continuing to be highly popular, hitting a 20 million concurrent players count two weeks in a row this month.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just as further data points because I think this is  understated: Steal a Brainrot's passed 20m concurrents two weeks in a row this month. <a href="https://t.co/I9tIkevV3D">https://t.co/I9tIkevV3D</a> They were making $11m in July when they were half those concurrents. <a href="https://t.co/wVKBCeub9W">https://t.co/wVKBCeub9W</a></p><p>I could make the case…</p></div>— Jacob Navok (@JNavok) <a href="https://twitter.com/JNavok/status/1990189950017683519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>ARC Riders is the prime example of how AI can be used to enhance the experience of a video game, but other implementations can be just as interesting, and far from falling into the AI slop category that is at the center of the current debate. Everstone Studio's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">Where Winds Meet</a>, for example, features some NPCs powered by AI chatbots, which can lead to a variety of interactions, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ai-chatbot-npcs-are-unironically-the-games-best-feature/">ranging from appropriate to wildly hilarious</a>. Other games, however, lean more into the category reviled by many, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which replaced real art for its calling cards with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/">AI-generated images that leave a lot to be desired.</a></p>



<p>Where do you stand in this raging debate? Does AI usage put you off, or are you okay with it as long as the game is fun? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>Unity surprised everyone this morning during the <a href="https://on.unity.com/Unite2025Live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unite 2025 keynote</a> in Barcelona, Spain, when Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was suddenly called on stage to announce a partnership between the two companies behind the most used third-party game engines in the industry. </p>



<p>Sweeney said he <span>spoke with Matthew Bromberg, president and CEO of Unity (who replaced John Riccitiello after the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/" target="_blank">former CEO's resignation following the runtime fee controversy</a>), about the companies' sh</span>ared objective of supporting open digital platforms. </p>



<p>The first result of this collaboration will be that Unity's brand-new in-app purchase software development kit (SDK) will soon be available to Unreal Engine developers, allowing them to choose this API to handle cross-platform purchases. Sweeney noted that this will become even more important now that Google and Apple are being forced (after Epic's lawsuits) to open up the Android and iOS ecosystems a little.</p>



<p>Arguably, though, the bigger news is that the Fortnite ecosystem, which boasts 500 million registered accounts, is embracing games made in Unity. Sweeney said:</p>



<p><em>Fortnite is a huge game that hit 100 million monthly active users last Holiday. And though it began as a little Battle Royale game that we built, over time, it's evolved into an ecosystem where 40% of playtime is going to third-party content built by independent developers. They're earning hundreds of millions of dollars a year from participating in Fortnite, and now it's going to open up to all Unity games thanks to some really amazing network technology that Unity built that connects other engines into Unity through a networking protocol to make this work. So, starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite's discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines.</em></p>



<p>In somewhat related news, Fortnite recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-island-creators-can-test-selling-items-in-islands-loot-box-style-random-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allowed</a> Island Creators to sell items within their Islands, including random rewards that appear to be functionally similar to lootboxes.</p>

			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally received its biggest update since launch, introducing crucial system improvements, most notably to game performance and power consumption.</p>



<p>The new update, which went live a few hours ago, brings plenty of improvements, including some highly requested community features such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>New CPU P-Core and E-Core settings for the X model</li>



<li>Quick access to the full-screen mode</li>



<li>Adjusted FPS limited option from 45 to 40 FPS to better align with the panel's 120 Hz refresh rate,</li>



<li>Improved power consumption in Modern standby</li>



<li>Improved Game performance with the AMD GPU driver V25.10.27</li>



<li>Improved firmware stability</li>



<li>Overall System Performance Improvement</li>
</ul>



<p>The features above are only the highlights of the biggest ROG Xbox Ally update since the system's launch last month. All the details can be found on the <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/changelogs/changelog-november-2025-rog-ally-ally-x-xbox-ally-xbox-ally-x/ba-p/1124876">official update notes.</a></p>



<p>As battery life is usually a significant pain point for handheld devices such as the ROG Xbox Ally, power consumption improvements are quite welcome, and make the system an even more enticing purchase for those looking to get into PC handheld gaming, despite some lingering issues preventing it from delivering the same hassle-free gaming experience as consoles.

			<p>Half-Life 3 fans were not nearly sated by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware announcements Valve made last week</a> (the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, all due sometime early next year). They believed before those announcements and their faith was renewed when several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> to the game's existence and potential imminent launch. Now, though, more sources have added fuel to the hype, just as the franchise celebrates the 27th anniversary since the release of the original Half-Life.</p>



<ul>
<li>Insider Nate the Hate, who has a solid track record, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990879872751735291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> that his sources also spoke about Half-Life 3. However, he received some conflicting information on the announcement timing; one of the things he heard was that it was going to happen at noon yesterday, which obviously wasn't the case.</li>



<li>Shpeshal_Nick, who has a slightly more checkered track record, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1990890439633682499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>: <em>Last week I got a DM that Valve was showing off hardware “this week” (last week) and software “next week” (this week). This software was allegedly Half-Life 3.</em></li>



<li>The Verge journalist Sean Hollister was among those invited to Valve's headquarters for the aforementioned hardware announcements. In a brief story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the website</a>, he noted that the developer's halls were strangely filled with security guards, which never happened on his previous visits. The story also included a picture of a Steam Machine visually customized with several memes, including a title that starts with H and is 'censored'. Fans took it as a tease from Valve that soon, it might not be censored anymore, at long last.</li>
</ul>



<p>Traces of a game project codenamed HLX were discovered through extensive data mining and references across Source 2 engine updates. Tyler McVicker alleged <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as early as this past May</a> that the project believed to be Half-Life 3 was almost at the end of its development. </p>



<p>Needless to say, an announcement on the anniversary of the debut installment in the franchise would make a lot of sense. Besides, Valve unveiled its upcoming hardware exactly a week ago, so if they did want to space their news evenly, today would be the day for the next announcement.</p>
