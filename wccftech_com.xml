			<p><strong>Ubisoft </strong>chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong> has finally spoken outside of the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">financial earnings reports</a> after kicking off 2026 by confirming a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>"</a> that involved huge structural changes to Ubisoft and saw hundreds of developers get laid off, either <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">through cuts</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/">different branches</a> or just <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">full studio shutdowns</a>. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a>, Guillemot didn't offer any meaningful comments in response to questions about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/1200-ubisoft-employees-kick-off-three-day-international-strike/">strikes across different studios within the company</a> or provide any further comment as to why projects like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong> were cancelled that we hadn't heard before. But he did at least provide an update as to what's happening with a couple of the company's major franchises.</p>



<p>In terms of the <strong>Far Cry</strong> series, Guillemot confirmed that <strong>two new games</strong> are in development, one of which we can likely assume to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/">Far Cry 7</a>,</strong> while the other is likely to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-far-cry-multiplayer-2025-alaska/">Project Maverick</a></strong>, the multiplayer Far Cry game we first heard about more than three years ago.</p>



<p>The other series Guillemot provided a bit of an update on is, unsurprisingly, <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong>. Guillemot confirmed there are "<em>several</em>" Assassin's Creed titles in the works, <a href="https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/">which isn't exactly news</a>, but he did add that the projects include both <strong>single-player</strong> and <strong>multiplayer</strong> games. </p>



<p>"<em>We have a solid pipeline underway across <strong>Vantage Studios</strong>. Under the 'Assassin's Creed' brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year</em>," Guillemot said. "<em>On 'Far Cry,' anticipation is high, and we currently have <strong>two very promising projects in development</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, in relation to what both franchises are doing outside of video games, Guillemot gave a shout-out to the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-series-fx-now-official-produced-fargo-creator-noah-hawley/">Far Cry TV series coming from <strong>FX</strong></a> and confirmed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-dogs-film-is-in-development-and-already-has-its-protagonist/"><strong>Watch Dogs</strong> film has completed production.</a> He also shared his excitement about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/">Assassin's Creed <strong>Netflix </strong>TV series</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/"><strong>Splinter Cell Deathwatch</strong> series getting renewed</a> for a second season.  </p>



<p>Overall, if you were hoping for a candid explanation as to what has happened with the company over the last few years, and what Guillemot and the rest of its top brass are doing to turn things around for the better, to say you'll be left wanting is an understatement.</p>



<p>Especially when it comes to Guillemot's response to questions about nepotism with regard to installing his son, <strong>Charlie Guillemot</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">one of the two co-leaders of Vantage Studios.</a></p>



<p>"<em>Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritizing sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles. This perspective guides our decisions and helps us build franchises, teams, and strategies that endure for decades</em>," Guillemot said.</p>



<p>"<em>I <strong>strongly believe </strong>that Christophe Derennes and Charlie are the right leaders as co-CEOs of Vantage Studios. They bring complementary strengths and experience that make them well-suited for the role. Their appointment was based on their skills, track record, and fit for the role</em>."</p>



<p>As a reminder, Derennes steps into the role after previously leading Ubisoft's North American studios under the company's old structure. Charlie Guillemot's track record, however, includes being given a studio head position at Ubisoft right out of college, with the sole game that studio put out getting cancelled after one year and a major controversy. It also includes leaving Ubisoft to start an NFT-focused company, and one other role within Ubisoft before being given the keys to its biggest franchises.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“We’ve Heard the Message Very Clear”: DICE is Focusing on Larger Battlefield 6 Maps, but Don’t Expect Them in Season 2]]></title>

			<p><strong>Season 2</strong> for <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-now-live-drives-highest-steam-concurrent-count-this-month/">arrived earlier this week</a> after an unexpected <strong>one-month delay</strong>. While we can hopefully trust the <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> teams when they say the length between Season 1 and Season 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/">was an isolated case,</a> the new content in Season 2 hasn't exactly set the game's community on fire, and players still have several issues with the new content.</p>



<p>Outside of complaints about the new <strong>VL-7</strong> gas (which a scroll through the r/Battlefield page will show you players are either very positive on or very against), one thing that Battlefield 6 players agree on is that they want larger maps to run around. According to series producer <strong>Phillipp Girette</strong> at <strong>DICE</strong>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/dice-has-heard-the-message-very-clear-and-is-now-prioritizing-larger-maps-for-battlefield-6-but-it-takes-a-really-long-time/">PC Gamer</a>, the team is extremely aware of this. But don't hold your breath for a brand new large map coming anytime soon.</p>



<p>"<em>We don't want to spoil too much yet, but we've <strong>heard the message very clear</strong></em>," Girette said on the topic of players wanting larger maps. "<em>You've seen recently in Battlefield Labs that we started testing <strong>Golmud Railway,</strong> one of the older Battlefield maps. That is one of the responses [to that feedback] that we can give there, and the rest is for the future</em>."</p>



<p>So, in a similar vein to how <strong>EA</strong> and Battlefield Studios are pulling on fan-favourite elements of past Battlefields, like bringing back the <strong>Little Bird</strong> helicopter to kick off Season 2, and calling back to <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> by bringing back Operations with <strong>Operation Augur</strong>, an upcoming LTM set to arrive in the final phase of Season 2, we'll also likely see the return of old Battlefield maps, like Golmud Railway.</p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and it's a strategy that will likely add larger maps to Battlefield 6 faster than it would if the Battlefield Studios teams were making them from scratch. But it's not exactly the most exciting proposition to always be looking forward to the return of old maps. The problem, of course, with making brand-new, large scale maps, is how long it takes to make them.</p>



<p>"<em>For the maps, we try to make changes for the ones that are currently in development. And then we look further ahead, as you said. <strong>It takes a really long time to make these maps</strong>. We're somewhat, not limited, but we have to be very targeted in what we do…I think we will definitely take a look at the existing maps, but there's nothing we could announce that is going to happen within Season 2.</em>"</p>



<p>The idea that the team is making tweaks to new maps it already had in development is, again, a good sign and one that shows how the team is trying to respond to player feedback as quickly as it can. But that could also result in those maps just feeling stretched out. We've also seen how EA can overdo it in terms of the size of maps before, just ask anyone who was in <strong>Battlefield 2042</strong> when it launched.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the team is able to strike a good balance and get new, large-scale maps out to players sooner than later, at least for the start of Season 3, if it won't happen in Season 2.</p>
