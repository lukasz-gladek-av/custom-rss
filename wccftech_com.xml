			<p>Following the release of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></strong> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series X|S</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> earlier this year and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></strong> this June, the third and final entry in the remake trilogy is the only entry in the series that is set to release on every modern gaming platform. While this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/">multiplatform pivot</a></strong> has been welcomed by Switch 2 and Xbox players, many have voiced concerns that the final part of the trilogy will have to make some compromises in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">visual quality</strong> due to the lower specifications of the Nintendo Switch and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong>, besides continuing to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/"><strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong></a>.</p>



<p>However, this will not be the case, as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong> development team's approach takes platform differences into consideration while scaling down from the lead version of the game: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC version</strong>.</p>



<p><em>"The quality of the trilogy will not be diminished, and that's not the kind of development structure we have in the first place,"</em> said <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in a fresh interview with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/ff7f-20260216-421552/">Automaton</a></strong>. <em>"I think I have no choice but to keep saying this."</em></p>



<p>Realizing that the concerns may be justified, as he never went in-depth on why <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't be dragged down</strong> by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S, Hamaguchi-san provided a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">thorough explanation</strong> on why this won't happen, breaking things down by component, starting with potential <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ROM limitations</strong> deriving from the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges</strong>. As the game will launch at retail on a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Game-Key Card</strong>, file size will not be an issue on the other platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-managing-ram-on-nintendo-switch-2-vs-xbox-series-s">Managing RAM on Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Xbox Series S</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-RAM.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With proper RAM optimization, Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 will not be dragged down by the Switch 2 and Xbox Series S versions.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM</strong> is among the biggest difference between modern consoles, but this too won't be a concern for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The Nintendo Switch 2 has plenty of RAM, so it shouldn't be affected. It's true that it will struggle with the Xbox Series S, but that's been addressed by fine-tuning each platform to the utmost. So, RAM issues won't restrict other platforms,"</em> Hamaguchi-san explained.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-npc-density-will-be-critical-for-cpu-optimization">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 NPC Density Will Be Critical For CPU Optimization</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-part-3-NPCs-Density.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3's world may feel a little less lively on lower-end platforms</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The differences in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU</strong> between the systems are unlikely to be a cause for concern. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The way we currently make games is that if a game runs at 30fps on PS4, Nintendo Switch 2, or Xbox Series S, then it should be able to run at 60fps on a high-end platform. In other words, we don't design games with the assumption that it will run at 30fps on a high-end CPU and use all of its available capacity,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"For hardware with CPU power to spare, we use a method of scaling only the density of NPCs in towns, such as the number of NPCs. This means that towns may feel more lively on high-spec hardware, while the number of NPCs may be lower on other hardware."</em> As such, the director of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 believes the team is unlikely to encounter <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU-related issues</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gpu-optimization-and-asset-reduction-from-leading-pc-platform">GPU Optimization and Asset Reduction From Leading PC Platform</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-PC-leading-platform.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Those with high-end PCs will be able to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 at their best, according to Hamaguchi-san.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The final concern fans have, and the one Hamaguchi-san recognizes is the biggest, is related to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">GPU</strong>. Even in this case, however, the Final Fantasy VII Remake series director believes there won't be issues, thanks to <span>the team's development approach, which&nbsp;<strong>scales down from the leading PC version</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>focuses on&nbsp;</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">optimization</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The FFVII Remake series has been purchased by a huge number of customers on Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we are also conscious of creating assets for the wider PC market during development. That's why we create 3D asset data with the highest asset quality based on PC,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em>"As a basic data design, we don't conform to low standards, but create assets for even higher-end use. We call this reduction, and the design involves adjusting and tuning the asset level to suit each platform. In that sense, it's a design philosophy that basically doesn't affect high-spec platforms. This isn't just something we do, but is a relatively common way of thinking in game development environments these days."</em> As such, those with high-end platforms will be able to enjoy the game at its best, while console players will still have a <strong>great experience tailored to their hardware</strong> of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-is-now-playable">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 Is "Now Playable"</h2>



<p>After the end of this exhausting explanation, Naoki Hamaguchi provided a small <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">update on the yet-to-be-revealed Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Development is proceeding almost exactly on time, according to the schedule and milestones set at the beginning of development, and the game is now playable. As a team, we are in the final push to continue developing the game, so the quality is improving day by day, and as a repeat player, the scenery changes every day, making it exciting. So, I think that in the not-too-distant future, we will have an opportunity to share some information with you all."</em> </p>



<p>Hopefully, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/">it really won't take much longer</a></strong> to finally see this highly anticipated game in action.</p>

			<p>If you have been following tech news <span>over the past few months, you are well aware of how the&nbsp;<strong>widespread adoption of AI</strong>&nbsp;is causing many</span> issues for consumers, with <strong>prices of components</strong> such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ram-prices-are-flattening-out-over-the-past-few-days-but-dont-be-fooled/"><strong>RAM</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sandisk-wd-black-sn7100-sn8100-1-tb-ssds-have-risen-to-246-366/">SSDs</a></strong> <strong>skyrocketing</strong> in a matter of days. </p>



<p>These price increases and the limited availability of components for anything that is not supposed to be used in an AI data center is making things difficult even for console manufacturers, so much so that <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Sony is reportedly actively considering a delay of its PlayStation 6 system.</strong></p>



<p>In a new report posted today on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a></strong>, according to people "<em>familiar</em>" with the company's thinking, <em>"Sony Group Corp. is now considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029."</em></p>



<p> While this isn't the first time we have heard of a possible <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/">delay for the PlayStation 6</a></strong> beyond the expected 2027 release window, the number of reports in the past few weeks suggests <strong>this is no longer a last-case scenario but a concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Things are not any easier for the manufacturers who managed to release their hardware before this <strong>chip crisis</strong> showed its ugly head. According to people familiar with the company's plan who spoke with Bloomberg, Nintendo is also <strong>contemplating raising the price of the Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in 2026. </p>



<p>Again, this isn't very surprising. Back in November, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 price</strong></a> was expected to remain stable in the immediate future unless "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected event</em>." Still, this is an unfortunate turn of events that will eventually <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">price many gamers out of current-generation systems.</strong></p>



<p>The PlayStation 6 may not be the only next-generation console to see a consistent delay over its expected release window. The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">next-generation Xbox may launch in 2027</strong></a>, but that is reportedly a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">best-case scenario</strong></a>, and with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">Magnus APU being more expensive</a></strong> than the chip powering Sony's systems, the system would be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">commercially</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">doomed</strong> if it launched at a very high price that would be in complete contrast to the concept of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">affordability</strong> that makes <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">consoles enticing to consumers.</strong></p>
