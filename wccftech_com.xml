			<p>IO Interactive is quickly approaching the launch date for what has been described as the peanut butter and chocolate of video games: IO Interactive behind a new James Bond game. 007 First Light will <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27, 2026</a>, and leading up to that launch, IO Interactive has kicked off a new series of videos on the game's YouTube channel called Beyond the Light, going behind the scenes of the game's development.</p>



<p>The first episode of the series includes reactions and insights from the developers regarding gameplay, with IO Interactive's gameplay director on 007 First Light, Andreas Krogh, and senior level designer Thomas Pulluello featured in the episode.</p>

<p>A little over a week ago, as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox's Partner Preview event</a>, IO Interactive confirmed that 007 First Light will <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/">feature Bond with his iconic silver Aston Martin Valhalla</a>, decked out to the nines with spy gear, courtesy of Q. </p>



<p>Now with the release of this first Beyond the Light series, it's clear that the studio is ramping up towards the launch of its first brand-new major release since 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hitman-3-steady-hand-trigger/">when Hitman 3 first launched</a>. As far as what comes after 007 First Light, just yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-devleoper-confirms-new-game-is-coming-007-only-external-ip-studio-would-work-on/">the studio confirmed that it does have another new game in the works</a>.</p>



<p>Not an external IP, but a new internal property it's working on. This is another new title in addition <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-confirms-long-rumored-online-fantasy-rpg/">to the fantasy role-playing game</a> that the studio is working on, for which we don't yet have a title. There will also be more Hitman coming, which means that, including 007 First Light, the studio currently has three projects in the works.</p>



<p>Hopefully, by this time next year, we'll start to hear more about what the studio is working on, since by that point it'll have First Light out the door and can start looking towards what's next.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Skyblivion Is Officially Delayed to 2026; It Will Be a ‘Living Project’ with Features Like Spellcrafting Possibly Coming Post-Launch]]></title>

			<p>It was January 2023 when the Skyblivion team originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its targeted 2025 launch window. Throughout the past couple of years, the modders have <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuck to their schedule</a>, maintaining that they would be able to bring the ambitious total conversion project to fruition by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Today, though, Project Lead Rebelzize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a video update</a> to confirm that won't happen, as there are simply too many things left to do. The complete fan-made recreation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will, therefore, be released at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>The good news is that the game is in a great state, and many aspects are complete or nearly complete. The world map, for example, was troublesome to implement but is now 100% finished, including all unique regions, realms, and the Oblivion Deadlands. Skyblivion fans can now get a glimpse of it through an interactive satellite-style map, <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now live on the project's website</a>.</p>



<p>All quest dungeons are also complete, rebuilt with new layouts, bespoke boss encounters, and unique quest rewards; only a handful of random dungeons remain unfinished. Most interiors, such as houses, shops, castles, stables, chapels, and inns, are ready. However, many Imperial City interiors are blocked until the city's 3D asset set is finalized, with the expectation to complete all locations by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Indeed, the Skyblivion team outlines the Imperial City as the single largest remaining content challenge. Quest implementation is progressing somewhat smoothly, but is still partially blocked by the remaining work needed in the Imperial City. The goal is to finish quests by Q1 2026, leaving time for playtesting and iteration before launch. Once the Imperial City, navmesh, quests, and core systems like alchemy, spells, perks, and crafting (which should be feature complete by the end of 2025) are wrapped and polished, the modders believe the project will finally be ready for its targeted 2026 release. All other major cities, like Anvil, Bravil, Bruma, Cheydinhal, Chorrol, Leyawiin, Skingrad, and the ruined Kvatch, have been implemented.</p>



<p>The User Interface (UI) is still under development. The team has moved toward a more Skyrim-like interface, with function and consistency taking precedence over aesthetics, although a custom reskin may be implemented later. Core UI work is expected to be done by the first quarter of 2026.</p>

<p>The Skyblivion team is even developing a large final fight cinematic between Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon, handled by professional animators, but production is bottlenecked by manpower in rendering, set dressing, VFX, and destruction simulation. Rebelzize calls out for volunteer specialists in those areas to apply so the cinematic can reach the desired quality. If you have such expertise and are willing to help, contact the team <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through this form</a>.</p>



<p>Not all features will be included in version 1.0. For example, underwater combat has been cut due to major conflicts with animation mods, although it may be reintroduced at a later date. Indeed, Rebelzize described this as a living project, which will continue to be refined with bug fixes, but also expanded with the original Oblivion DLC (Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine), and with additional features like spell crafting, dynamic dungeons, grave-robbing, more creature variety, followers, weapons, armor sets, and more. </p>



<p>Overall, it's sad news for those who still wished to play Skyblivion during the Holidays. However, even professional games are always prone to delays, let alone volunteer projects like this one. Moreover, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did release the official Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</a>, so those who really want to explore a modern version of the classic roleplaying game already have a way to do so.</p>
