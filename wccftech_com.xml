			<p>10 years ago today, on May 19, 2015, CD Projekt RED released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, and the studio's trajectory was forever changed. The team is celebrating that 10-year anniversary today with celebratory livestreams, showcases of new artworks, and more to come, according to the studio.</p>
<p>CD Projekt RED also released a new trailer to celebrate the anniversary, showcasing key moments from the game's campaign that has kept players coming back to it for 10-straight years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — 10th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWOkT7l0yWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On social media, CD Projekt RED developers who worked on The Witcher 3 are sharing their own thoughts and memories on the anniversary. Associate game director at CD Projekt RED,<a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1924127082151371015"> Pawel Sasko wrote in a post on X</a> "<em>I had such high hopes regarding this game, but never really though any of it is really possible. Feeling really blessed and thankful.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I was there from the first day, saw it develop from the first pitch, have been so lucky to impact it's shape to some small degree, and never thought you will love it this much. Art does not exist without the audience and you all are an important part of this story,</em>" he continued.</p>
<p>Sasko also briefly spoke about what's to come for the studio, namely The Witcher 4, saying "<em>I want to make you proud of us and excited again. Capture lightning in the bottle, give you lifetime of memories, make you laugh and break down crying. So we can have another anniversary like this, one day again</em>."</p>
<p>Chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michal Nowakowski <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1924158300393791942">wrote</a> about his recollection of The Witcher 3, "<em>10 years ago, I remember being exhausted, anxious (to see the scores and players' reactions), buzzing with excitement. I think no one on the team had a decent sleep that night and we were all refreshing websites of media sites. The first 10/10 I saw was that from GameSpot. The rest was one crazy (and happy!) blur</em>."</p>
<p>"...<em>Cheers to the fantastic CDPR Team and to all the fans that have been with us through all the good and bad. Cannot wait for what is yet to come</em>."</p>
<p>The Witcher 3, and all of its expansions, are on sale as part of the celebrations on all platforms. There will also be a concert for fans to attend in Boston and <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Poznań, the first coming at the end of this month on May 31, and the latter on June 15, celebrating the game's score, visuals, and anniversary.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Kakao Games announced that the upcoming fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-ue5-mmorpg-gets-striking-gameplay-trailer-confirmed-for-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a> will soon be playable in a limited-time PC Closed Beta Test available next month <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873440/Chrono_Odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>. You can simply request access from the store page for a chance to be invited.</p>
<p>We hadn't heard from South Korean developer Chrono Studio in some time. The latest trailer was released during the Game Developers Conference 2024, which took place in March of that year. Afterward, we only got information about the release window from the publisher's schedule, which pointed <a href="https://wccftech.com/ue5-action-mmorpgs-archeage-chronicles-and-chrono-odyssey-dated-for-q4-2025-and-fy-2026-respectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a late 2025 debut of the game</a> (while ArcheAge Chronicles was moved to 2026). Still, that was around six months ago. It may well be that things have changed, and in any case, the CBT's feedback will be crucial to determine when the game will be released.</p>
<p>Sangtae Yoon, executive producer of Chrono Odyssey, stated:</p>
<p><em>Chrono Odyssey represents years of passion and innovation. This closed beta is our invitation to players worldwide to help shape the future of this ambitious project. We cannot wait to play alongside you, experience the story, and see what each and every one of you think of our game.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Chrono Odyssey | CBT Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6qozCE0gKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As hinted by the game's title, Chrono Odyssey allows players to wield time-manipulation powers. That includes combat, which will feature powers like Time Rewind and Dodge. In the beta, players can select three of the six classes featured in the final game: Swordsman, Ranger, and Berserker. Each has its own unique skill tree.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game also promises near-instantaneous world transitions, a seamless and detailed world, dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and ever-shifting terrain shaped by temporal rifts.</p>
<p>The full game will also include standard MMORPG content such as dungeons, raids, and PvP, as well as activities like harvesting, logging, mining, and skinning.</p>
<p>Despite having been made with UE5, the system requirements listed on Steam are fairly low:</p>

			<p>New early Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 comparison videos were shared online over the weekend, highlighting how the upcoming new version of the game holds up surprisingly well compared to other versions.</p>
<p>The new comparison videos, which were put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BluntyTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blunty</a>, compare the latest high-quality footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version which was shared by developer CD Projekt Red itself after providing it for a round of<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-footage-underestimated/"> Japanese previews</a>, featuring the same sequences seen in the footage recreated on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and on an ROG Ally that simulates the Steam Deck specs. While the new version of the game clearly loses to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions in terms of graphics and performance, it holds up extremely well to them, considering we are talking about handheld hardware. In the comparison with the simulated Steam Deck specs, the Nintendo Switch 2 version fares better, although that is to be expected, considering the game is presumably running in docked mode in the footage, so handheld mode footage will be needed for a proper comparison, which may not be made available in high-quality before launch.</p>

<p>Despite being available for five years now, Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 has quickly become one of the most anticipated launch games for the system. It will likely set a pretty high bar in terms of multiplatform ports on it. CD Projekt Red has put <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">incredible care</a> into this new version of the game, not wanting a repeat of the launch fiasco on previous generation consoles, and it definitely shows.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most of the world.</p>
