			<p>Last month, it was widely reported that a stapler ruined the Nintendo Switch 2 launch for some unlucky players who ordered a unit by a GameStop New York store. Now, you can own this involuntary piece of memorabilia and help a charity in the process.</p>



<p>On X, GameStop has confirmed that the infamous stapler used by an employee to staple a receipt directly to a customer's Nintendo Switch 2 box, puncturing both the box and the screen, has been put up for auction on eBay. The stapler comes with a certificae of authenticity and the first unit that has been damaged by it, complete with damaged packaging, although GameStop assured the system has been repaired and is in full working conditions. The stapler and the repaired system are currently going for almost $109,000, but the price is likely going to get higher by the time the auction ends next week. All proceeds will be going to the <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/#:~:text=Children's%20Miracle%20Network%20Hospitals%20raises,most%20urgent%20needs%20are%20met.">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals charity.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though the Nintendo Switch 2 launch was marred by this incident for some unlucky players, the release of the next-generation Nintendo console was a smashing success, which is throughly deserved, as the new console is a considerable step up from its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the console by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Chris's review.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to be remembered for a very long time as a great technical achievement, given what the console manages to achieve using so little power in both docked and handheld modes compared to other versions of the game.</p>



<p>In a new video comparing the Nintendo Switch 2 version and the PC version running on Steam Deck, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> also provided an in-depth look at how the graphics settings of the Switch 2 version compare to the different options available on PC. The comparison is favorable for the new generation Nintendo system, as many settings, like crowd density and volumetric fog, are closer to the medium settings, rather than the expected low settings, while others are closer to the high settings, like ambient occlusion and mirror quality in docked mode. Other settings are difficult to match on the PC version of the game due to the ample customization made for the Switch 2 version, but even then, there are many instances where the port impresses, such as with screen space reflections, which are close to the high PC setting in some scenarios, and distant shadow resolution, which are similarly closer to the high settings on PC in several istances.</p>



<p>Even comparing the Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 settings to those of the PlayStation 5 version, the port looks impressive, as some options are set higher on the Nintendo system, although that is easily explained by the fact that the Switch 2 version renders at a much lower resolution. In terms of what's been actually rendered, the Switch 2 version, on the other hand, is in the same ballpark as the PS5 version, and superior to the PS4 and PS4 Pro versions, which was expected given the much better CPU and storage of the new Nintendo system.  The comparison between the two systems, much like the comparison with the PC settings, is quite favorable to the Nintendo system, as it shows how CDPR did not have to deal with extreme cutbacks for the new version of their open-world RPG.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-blade-game-only-entered-in-production-in-late-2024-according-to-a-financial-document.1240110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a while since we heard anything about Marvel's Blade. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-announced-arkane-lyon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at the 2023 The Game Awards event, when we learned that Arkane Lyon, the studio behind Dishonored and Deathloop, would be behind it. </p>



<p>The only other thing we know about it is that Marvel's Blade <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkanes-blade-game-to-run-in-deathloops-and-dishonored-2s-void-engine-senior-lighting-artist-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be powered by Arkane's own Void Engine</a>, previously seen in the aforementioned games, thus making Arkane Lyon one of the few studios that still sticks to proprietary technology instead of switching to Epic's Unreal Engine 5, as so many big studios have done (CD Projekt RED and Crystal Dynamics, to name two).</p>



<p>But what is the development status of the game? Well, it seems like it just entered full production. The information was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timur222.bsky.social/post/3ltlhwfmlac2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by eagle-eyed videogame enthusiast and 'Internet explorer' Timur222, who discovered it in Arkane Lyon's 2024 financial document (written in French), where the studio wrote:</p>



<p><em>Game development activities exclusively for the ZeniMax/Microsoft group are continuing. The production phase of the AAA game project was able to begin at the end of 2024, following prototype validation.</em></p>



<p>Marvel's Blade is the only triple-A game in development at Arkane. There can be no confusion there, especially after Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed the Austin-based sister studio last year</a>. Given the average triple-A game development time and the fact that Deathloop launched in September 2021, the game's release window will likely occur between 2026 and 2027, probably in the latter year. </p>



<p>Needless to say, we'll report any other leaks or rumors ahead of the official unveiling. Stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/minecraft-creator-buying-game-purchase-pirating-not-theft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-creator-says-that-if-buying-a-game-is-not-a-purchase-then-pirating-it-is-not-theft.1240092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Minecraft creator Markus Persson (also known simply as Notch) was never known to be of the diplomatic sort. Throughout the last thirteen years, he has made several controversial comments via social media, both on the games industry and various social issues. Sticking to the former, back in 2012, he famously gave his permission to a Minecraft fan to pirate the game if he could not afford it at the moment:</p>



<p><em>Just pirate it. If you still like it when you can afford it in the future, buy it then. Also, don’t forget to feel bad. 😉</em></p>



<p>At the 2011 Game Developers Conference, Persson was even more direct when telling his peers that piracy was not theft. He argued that if people stole a car, there would be one less in the world, whereas pirating a game simply means there is another copy in the world and possibly a new fan.</p>



<p>Now, the Minecraft creator has renewed his thoughts in light of the Stop Killing Games initiative. For context, the online petition is seeking to gather enough signatures to propose a bill to the UK and European parliaments to block game developers and publishers from making games that can eventually be 'killed' by permanently taking down servers. Last week, we covered one such example when Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that all services for BioWare's Anthem would cease on January 12, 2026. From that date onward, the game will be effectively unplayable.</p>



<p>The Stop Killing Games initiative has gained considerable momentum lately and is now nearing 1.3 million signatures, as you can see on the official website. Unsurprisingly, publishers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that if this were ever to pass, it would be 'prohibitively expensive' for them, which sounds like a hidden threat of even further price increases.</p>



<p>It is in this context that Markus Persson said: </p>



<p><em>If buying a game is not a purchase, then pirating them is not theft.</em></p>



<p>When asked what game developers and publishers should do instead of shutting games down, the Minecraft creator pointed out that old games used to allow players to host their own servers, which effectively kept those games alive even after the actual developer turned off their official servers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Persson <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gauged the interest of his followers</a> in him getting back to work on a spiritual successor to Minecraft. The response seemed positive, although it remains unclear whether this game will actually be made and, if so, when it could launch.</p>



<p>Besides that, do you agree with Persson's opinion on the subject?</p>

			<p>Bethesda has <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new patch for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered to the Steam Beta ring. If you wish to download it, just switch to the beta tab in your Steam library.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 introduces a series of fixes to performance, quests, and gameplay. Arguably, the most interesting could be the allegedly reduced frequency of stutters when traversing the open world, which were really dreadful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at launch</a>. Here's the performance and visual related changelog:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drops in Black Rock Caverns</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drop south of Bravil Castle courtyard</li>



<li>Reduced the frequency of hitches in the open world.</li>



<li>General improvements to frame time in many locations.</li>

<li>Optimize the weather system.</li>



<li>Optimize the character animation system.</li>



<li>Fixed flickering shadows when using XeSS Upscaling</li>



<li>Fixed title properly restarting after purchasing the Deluxe Upgrade on PC</li>



<li>Fixed settings properly migrating between PC and XBOX</li>



<li>Fixed water disappearing after fast travel</li>

<li>Fixed shaders not preloading due to cloud save replication</li>



<li>Fixed long blackout during loading screens</li>



<li>Fixed weather VFX flashing while outside</li>



<li>Fixed motion blur artifacts while in the Oblivion Plane</li>



<li>Fixed NPCs not obeying the Wait action from the player</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, Bethesda Game Studios has introduced new difficulty options to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, specifically for Player Combat Damage and Enemy Combat Damage. Players can now select from “Novice”, “Apprentice”, “Adept”, “Journeyman”, “Expert”, and “Master” options in the Gameplay menu. The developers expressed the hope that the “Journeyman” setting would act as a better bridge between “Adept” and “Expert” for players.</p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered is currently still 20% off on Steam due <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the Summer Sale</a>, but the discount is only available for less than ten hours, so hurry up if you are interested.</p>
