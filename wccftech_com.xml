			<p>It's been announced that there is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-crew-grants-all-fortnite-passes-and-more-from-december-1/">new update</a> coming to LEGO Fortnite, expanding the universe with the launch of a new game called LEGO Fortnite Brick Life. In addition, there will also be a major content update to LEGO Fortnite Odyssey, which is the new name given to the original LEGO experience. The new game will be launching on December 12, and it is set to be a new social roleplay game where you can hang out with friends, complete jobs and quests, and decorate your own house.</p>
<p>LEGO Fortnite Brick Life is a new social roleplay game where up to 32 players can live in a bustling city in Fortnite. While playing this brand-new experience, players will be able to explore the built-up city and enjoy its vibrancy while getting to customize their own house to look however they like. In this game, you'll also be able to take on jobs and spend time with friends or other players by using text chat. LEGO Fortnite Brick Life will be an "ever-evolving experience" and will receive new content updates as time progresses, which will add new jobs, resources, and events to the game. If you find that you don't like the job you currently have in the game, you will be given the option to swap out and try something new if you want a change of pace.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Randy Pitchford's social tease that the Borderlands 4 reveal would be coming soon, the official franchise page on X has now <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1866166006353449188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1866166006353449188%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game will be shown at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2024 show. The tweet also boasts how it will be the franchise's most ambitious installment to date.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom this year for a generic 2025 release window. Other than the confirmation that it will take place on a brand new planet, not much has been shared so far. The studio did provide fans with a few concept art <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-concept-art-revealed-at-pax-west-202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during a panel at PAX West 2024</a>, but those were mere tidbits.</p>
<p>The series certainly needs a bit of pick-me-up following the disastrous launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live action adaptation.</a> Despite the presence of actors like Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Édgar Ramírez, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart, the film was a massive box office bomb (making only about a quarter of its $120 million budget back), receiving equally devastating reviews from critics and fans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the previous game in the series sold extremely well, surpassing 18 million units last year. Undoubtedly, Gearbox owner Take Two (following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-buys-gearbox-for-460-million-confirms-new-borderlands-game-among-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$460 million acquisition from Embracer Group</a>) will try to match or even exceed those financial results with Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It seems like they're going all-in with The Game Awards 2024, anyway, as another heavy hitter of their 2025 lineup <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will also show a new trailer at the show. We're referring to Mafia: The Old Country, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. Developed by Hangar 13, it will function as a prequel, delving into the origins of the Mafia in the fictional Sicilian city of San Celeste.</p>
<p>Those rumors about a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2024-will-have-big-news-says-vgcs-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big The Game Awards 2024 show</a> are taking shape. As a reminder, the show will go live on Thursday, December 12, at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>
