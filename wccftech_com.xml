			<p>Split Fiction has had a "<em>hugely successful launch</em>" according to <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">EA</a>, as the latest co-op adventure from Hazelight Studios nears&nbsp;<strong>4 million copies sold</strong>. The game was highlighted by EA in its wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year, and counted as a key part of what led to a "<em>strong finish</em>" for the year alongside EA Sports FC 25.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios followed up the news from the financial report with a post on its official <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892">X</a> account, saying "<em>4 million sold! So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it's amazing...Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight. And so many hot dogs made...</em>"</p>
<p>Hazelight's previous title and game of the year winner in 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two,</a> surpassed <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies sold in March 2025</a>. Split Fiction has a long way to go to reach that milestone, but it certainly seems like it's on its way there.</p>
<p>Just last week, we learned that the previously announced Split Fiction movie will star Sydney Sweeney as one of the two female leads. It's not yet known which of the two she will play or who will join her as a co-star. Wicked director Jon M. Chu has signed on to direct the adaptation, with Deadpool &amp; Wolverine writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese penning the script.</p>
<p>Along with confirming the sales milestone for Split Fiction, EA's wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year confirmed that the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">Battlefield</a> game will be revealed this summer and that it will release sometime before April 2026. The next Skate game is also set to release during that same period.</p>

			<p>EA announced in its latest <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">financial report</a> for Q4 of its 2025 fiscal year that the next Battlefield game will be fully revealed sometime this summer and will launch before the end of its 2026 fiscal year, ending April 2026. It also confirmed that the highly anticipated return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-skate-game-wont-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-multiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox/">Skate</a> will arrive sometime in this fiscal year ending April 2026.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Andrew Wilson highlighted the release and reveal of Battlefield, calling it "<em>a pivotal step</em>" as the company moves forward in this fiscal year.</p>
<p>"<em>As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline</em>," Wilson said. "<em>Beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment</em>."</p>
<p>Later in the report, EA states that it expects its revenue for its 2026 fiscal year to be driven by "<em>the EA Sports portfolio, The Sims, and the launches of Battlefield and Skate.</em>" Previously, EA announced that the new Skate game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">released in early access sometime this year</a>. We've yet to see an official release date.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-will-add-more-players-to-battlefield-labs-playtesting-this-month-across-europe-north-america-and-asia/">EA provided a development update</a> for the new Battlefield game and its Battlefield Labs playtesting, where it confirmed that players in Asia will begin to be invited, and that the playtest will grow in scale over May to invite more players to participate and introduce new content.</p>
