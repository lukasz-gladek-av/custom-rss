			<p>It's been exactly a year since Frogwares <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-goes-to-kickstarter-soon-as-frogwares-needs-a-safety-net-from-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> its fans that The Sinking City 2 would get a Kickstarter funding campaign. Back then, the Ukrainian studio aimed to launch it shortly, but clearly, there were some hiccups.</p>
<p>The campaign is finally <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=discovery_category&amp;total_hits=21544&amp;category_id=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live</a>, though, and its minimum goal of €100K has already been nearly doubled as of this writing. So far, Frogwares has not shared any info on the stretch goals, but they're sure to come with 29 days left in the campaign.</p>

<p>Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.</em></p>
<p>Frogwares Publishing Director Sergiy Oganesyan also spoke about the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> slight genre change, moving away from adventure to a full-fledged horror title:</p>
<p><em>When we announced The Sinking City 2 back in 2024, we stated this is going to be our chance to shift our studio into creating games that are more “horror first” focused and the results we’re all seeing internally are extremely promising. We’re not ditching our investigation roots entirely, but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow. We’ve placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional.</em></p>

<p>The Sinking City 2 is being made with Unreal Engine 5 and will launch on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>AMD FSR 4, the latest version of the upscaling technology made by AMD, was co-developed with Sony. The news came <a href="https://x.com/amdradeon/status/1897741520200962308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a tweet</a> pushed by AMD itself, where it was added that this is just the beginning:</p>
<p><em>Happy Radeon Day! We’re proud to collaborate with PlayStation on Project Amethyst!</em></p>
<p><em>FSR 4 is looking fantastic! Excited for the co-development with Sony Interactive Entertainment on the models used for the AMD FSR 4 upscaler. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for what’s next!</em></p>
<p>For those who may not remember, the joint machine learning project Amethyst was announced in late 2024 by Sony. In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Wccftech interview with Mark Cerny</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect explained:</p>
<p><em>Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</em></p>
<p><em>We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud. For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</em></p>
<p>The collaboration is specifically on the AI models, then. It's the big AMD FSR 4 change, after all. FSR 1 was just a spatial upscaler, whereas FSR 2 switched to a temporal upscaler. Neither could possibly perform as well as an AI model, though, which has now been proven with the launch of FSR 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a massive improvement over FSR 3</a>. Of course, the trade off is that AMD had to restrict it to the new Radeon RX 9000 Series, just like NVIDIA has been doing with DLSS and its GeForce RTX Series.</p>
<p>Still, AMD should definitely be commended for its efforts to catch up with NVIDIA. While the DLSS 4 transformer model remains the gold standard for upscaling, AMD FSR 4 has reduced that gap considerably, a far from easy feat to accomplish given NVIDIA's headstart. The increased competition in the space will no doubt spur NVIDIA to further improvements and so on, eventually benefiting all users.</p>
