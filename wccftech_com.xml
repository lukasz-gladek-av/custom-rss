			<p>Sonic Rumble is a new party game from Sega inspired by the highly popular party game Fall Guys. The title was originally meant to launch at the end of 2024, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. This news was announced in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> by Sega, where they went on to tease some of the features that people can expect to see in the game. Sega also went on to say:</p>
<p><em>We would like to extend a huge thank you to our players and Sonic fans for their patience in waiting for the global launch of Sonic Rumble. The team is committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans with even more new game mechanics, new features, and more exciting content to look forward</em> to.</p>

<p>While the game doesn't have a set release date yet, Sega has confirmed that the game will be coming in Spring, and even included a roadmap for the game within the blog post.</p>
<p>Sonic Rumble was already available to some degree in a pre-launch early-access period, where players would get to experiment with a limited amount of features. With the game's full global launch coming in Spring 2025, this will take the game to 1.2.0, where a competitive game mode will be added, as well as a feature called "Crew," which will allow players to team up together and play Sonic rumble.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to dedicate a significant amount of time to the game, a game mode named Quick Rumble will also be available for players at launch. Instead of a full-scale match, this instead provides matches that last one round and is perfect for those players out there who may not like long play sessions or those who don't have much time to spare.</p>
<p>In addition to the three features, Sega also spoke about how it is making Sonic Rumble "truly unique."</p>
<p><em>We're making Sonic Rumble truly unique by embracing the abilities of your favorite characters from across Sonic's universe. Ever wanted to stun rivals with Amy's Piko Piko Hammer? Now you can!</em></p>
<p>Selected characters will have a certain set of unique abilities that will give those who play them the potential to get an advantage by utilizing the abilities and help keep the gameplay fresh.</p>
<p>When Sonic Rumble does release, it will be available on iOS and Android, as well as on PC via Steam. It's not certain yet whether there are plans to bring this game to console or whether the next big release on console will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a> first, which is set to release later this year on console and PC.</p>

			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 dock has arrived today, thanks to some new pictures shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2dH7Za0#n35dYx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new pictures</a>, which have been shared online by the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4119">Famiiboards forums</a>, provide a new look at the console's dock, highlighting some of the changes over the current dock, including what looks like a grid on the base of the dock, which suggests a change in the cooling and air intake over the current model.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-awaited reveal last month, Nintendo has kept pretty silent about its new system and will likely continue to do so until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>. According to a former Nintendo employee, the event won't only go over the Nintendo Switch 2 features that were briefly teased in the reveal trailer, but will also likely confirm the console's release date, which is speculated to be sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">June</a> for a few reasons, so there's the chance that we won't have to wait much longer to learn when it will finally launch worldwide.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches this year. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>A new Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition trailer was shared online today, providing a new look at the game's mechanics and features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioWlTKzw2VM">The new overview trailer</a>, which can be watched below, is an excellent introduction to the game, as it goes over its most important features, like exploration and traversal, the combat system, the armored vehicles Skells, online features, and more. The trailer also has something for those who played the game on Wii U, as it provides a new look at the additional story content of the Definitive Edition, which includes a new location to explore, new characters, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Everything you need to know about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioWlTKzw2VM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is setting out to be the best way to enjoy the game developed by Monolith Soft, thanks to its visual improvements and updated interface that make it easier to get into what can be a very overwhelming game, even for veterans of the series. You can learn more about what the game offers in its first ten or so hours by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-hands-on-impressions/">preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition doesn’t feel like a particularly radical upgrade through its first 10-or-so hours, but some UI updates and a limited visual makeover ought to make the game more approachable for the large majority of Switch owners who missed out on it the first time around. I still have a lot more to try out, including the game’s teased new content, but so far, it feels like X still marks the spot.</em></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches on Nintendo Switch on March 20th worldwide.</p>
