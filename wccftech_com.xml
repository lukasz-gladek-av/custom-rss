			<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q4 fiscal year 2025 results</a> show that Xbox content and services revenue grew 13% this quarter (12% when considering constant currency). Hardware revenue continues to decline (-22%), but overall gaming revenue is still up 10%. According to Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, the result was driven by 'better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass.'</p>



<p>During the subsequent investor call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared some new milestones, such as the fact that the Game Pass subscription service has nearly reached $5 billion of yearly revenue for the first time since its launch in 2017. Nadella also referenced the fact that Microsoft was the top publisher not only on Xbox but <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on PlayStation</a> this quarter. Lastly, the chief executive officer noted that Xbox has nearly 40 games in development.</p>



<p><em>When it comes to gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. And we are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter, with the successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger: 50 million people have played Black Ops 6. Total hours surpassed 2 billion.</em></p>



<p><em>Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of game play streamed via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.</em></p>



<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted, however, that Xbox revenue will likely decline in the first quarter of the next fiscal year due to a tough comparison with the previous year: </p>



<p><em>In Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid single digits.</em></p>



<p>Xbox Game Studios is about to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced</a> on PlayStation 5, no doubt hoping to repeat the excellent results of ports like Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The remaining release schedule for the publisher's calendar year includes Gears of War: Reloaded on August 26, Double Fine's new game Keeper on October 17, Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden 4 on October 21, and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 on October 29. There's also Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, although that one is technically published by Activision, which is nevertheless owned by Xbox.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has delved into the changes coming in the Season 3.5 update, showcasing the latest addition to the game's roster, Blade, changes to character team-ups, a new map, a new game mode, new features to help catch and penalize toxic players, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the new features, like Blade and NetEase's new monitoring of voice chat in matches and reviews of muted words, will arrive with the update on August 8, 2025. The new game mode, Resource Rumble, and the new map that it's introducing, Throne of Knull, won't arrive until a later update on August 22, 2025.</p>

<p>Regarding the team-up changes, two are being removed from play entirely: Guardian Revival and Atlas Bond. Loki is the only character who is being removed from a team-up, as Ragnarok Rebirth will now be a Hela/Thor team-up. Two new team-ups are being introduced, Duality Dance, which includes Adam Warlock and Luna Snow, and Vibrant Vitality, which includes Mantis and Groot/Loki.</p>



<p>Iron Fist will join the Chilling Assault team-up, and Star-Lord will join the Rocket Network team-up. Blade, as the new kid on the block, will join the Lunar Force team-up with Moon Knight and Cloak &amp; Dagger.</p>

<p>Beyond NetEase monitoring voice chat more closely and a custom filter for text chat to filter out muted words, the studio is also introducing harsher penalties for players who leave competitive matches. Players who quit competitive matches early will receive longer bans and larger point deductions, while the players who have to stick it out with a handicap thanks to their former teammate quitting will be offered point compensation when the match is over. </p>



<p>If you get booted from the match through no fault of your own, like losing a connection or your system crashing, NetEase promises to review mistaken bans and appeals faster, so players aren't wrongly sidelined. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals was one of the biggest games at the top of the year, and while its active player base (on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#max">Steam</a>, at least) has declined from the heights it was hitting in January, it still has tens of thousands of players each day. As NetEase continues to update and add to the game, it'll be interesting to see if it is able to repeat, or even surpass its launch numbers, with future changes and updates.</p>



<p>After all, a strong launch for a free-to-play live service game is a great thing, but the sign of a healthy live-service game is being able to leapfrog those launch numbers with a new update, something Marvel Rivals has not yet done.</p>
