			<p><strong>Circana</strong> executive director and video game industry analyst <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> has published the final report for video game software and hardware sales in the US for 2025, and all of the work that <strong>EA</strong> and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> put in last year seemingly paid off, because <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> was the <strong>best-selling game in the US in 2025.</strong></p>



<p>It officially beat <strong>Call of Duty</strong> on the sales front, a feat that many doubted Battlefield could accomplish. Everyone thought it would give Call of Duty a good deal of competition, but hardly anyone (<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">save for <strong>Mike Ybarra</strong>, who, to his credit, called this outcome back in August 2025</a>) thought that Battlefield 6 would have the juice to really squeeze out Call of Duty on the sales charts.</p>



<p>Even with <strong>Black Ops 7</strong> coming out on top for the monthly sales for December 2025, it was still only able to reach fifth place overall for 2025 premium sales. <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/">despite its performance struggles on PC</a>, had a strong enough launch that it was able to hold onto fourth place for the year. <strong>Borderlands 4</strong>, another game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-boss-borderlands-4-sales-softer-than-expected-poor-pc-release/">had performance issues at launch,</a> came in at third place, and <strong>NBA 2K26</strong> fell behind Battlefield 6 at second place.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the software charts for the year are <strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong>, which is the only other non-shooter or annual sports game to make the top-10 alongside Monster Hunter Wilds. <strong>Ghost of Yotei</strong> just missed joining them as it fell to eleventh place on the year, but even that still shows how well <strong>Sucker Punch's</strong> latest was received. Lastly, we'd be remiss to not point out that, once again, <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> was one of the best-selling games of the year, barely making the top charts in the number 20 spot.  </p>







<p>Strong as these software sales were, they were not what drove the US video game market to grow <strong>1.4%</strong> compared to 2024, with the market reaching <strong>$60.7 billion in 2025.</strong> That growth, according to Piscatella, came from <strong>mobile games</strong> and spending on<strong> hardware</strong>, namely the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, and <strong>subscription services</strong>.</p>



<p>But, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mczexudooc2v">as Piscatella notes in a separate post</a>, the increased spending wasn't necessarily driven by the number of people spending money on video games going up, but rather the price of everything, including subscription services, going up.</p>



<p>On the hardware side, the Nintendo Switch 2 was unsurprisingly the best-selling console in the US for 2025, reaching <strong>4.4 million units sold</strong> in the US for the year. <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> came behind the Switch 2 in second place for the year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Greedfall 2: The Dying World Will Launch Out of Early Access In March 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-release-date-march-2026/</link>

			<p>Publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Spiders</strong> have announced that <strong>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</strong> will launch out of early access and into its definitive <strong>1.0 version</strong> this coming <strong>March 10, 2026,</strong> on PC, and two days later, on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> it'll arrive on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes alongside a new gameplay overview trailer that digs into the different core aspects of Greedfall 2: The Dying World, including the game's story, the companions you'll meet along the way that fill out your adventures, combat, crafting, and more.</p>



<p>Greedfall 2: The Dying World launched in early access on PC on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-releases-september-24-in-early-access/">September 24, 2024</a></strong>, and has seen some major updates in that time, namely its largest one yet back in <strong>November 2025</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-gets-largest-early-access-update/">added a new region to explore, a new companion, and an overhaul to combat</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even though major updates like the aforementioned November 2025 update brought some much-needed overhaul, the game continues to struggle to gain any traction. An issue not helped by <a href="https://wccftech.com/spiders-management-respond-to-allegations-made-by-stjv/">allegations of internal issues at Spiders</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-developer-lays-off-most-animation-team/"><strong>layoffs</strong> that hit the studio</a> months ahead of the one-year mark for The Dying World's early access release.</p>



<p>Wccftech checked out Greedfall right when it launched in early access in September 2024, and while there was a core to the game that was fun to play, so much of it was an unfinished and janky mess. <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/">At the time, we even went so far as to say that it <strong>wasn't ready for an early access release</strong></a>. A feeling that was clearly shared by players, as noted by its negative reviews on Steam at its early access launch, and unfortunately, even recent reviews still cite major issues.</p>



<p>So far, Spiders has proclaimed that the early access version is only the first third of the game. Hopefully, with the other two-thirds and another major update that comes along with its 1.0 version, it can gain some forward momentum. We'll find out when it arrives on <strong>March 10, 2026</strong>, on PC and on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
