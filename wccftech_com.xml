			<p>Liquid Swords, a Swedish studio established by former <a href="https://wccftech.com/avalanche-studio-founder-opens-up-on-2015s-mad-max-development-blames-warner-bros-for-canceled-dlc-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg</a>, has <a href="https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1849727432904872311" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the first in-game screenshots of its GTA-like open-world game, and they look stunning. When asked whether these were actual images, the official X account confirmed they were real.</p>
<p>The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, whereas Avalanche has historically used its own Apex engine for Just Cause, Mad Max, and Rage 2. Tech Director Fredrik Lönn explained the engine choice with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Custom engines were historically the way forward, and that's what my former team at Avalanche did over 18 years ago when development started on Just Cause 1. The landscape has changed since then, and now it's quite the opposite. </em><em>We decided to go with Unreal Engine 5. Unreal has been proven for high-quality AAA games, both by Epic themselves in the case of Fortnite and by other game studios worldwide shipping amazing games on Unreal. With Epic making improvements toward open-world development, we get full access to the source code, and the integrations with other software and pipelines are excellent.</em></p>

<p>Liquid Swords was founded in December 2020. Sundberg recalled why he created this new studio:</p>
<p><em>In December 2020, I set out on a journey to make a difference in the world of game development– which has been my professional and entertainment world since the early 90s. I want to make a difference to how games are made, how the teams work, and how the creative process evolves. Liquid Swords is the realization of an ambition to refocus the game-development process.</em></p>
<p>Around two years later, the studio announced it had received an investment from NetEase Games. Sundberg said at the time:</p>
<p><em>NetEase Games has been exceptionally supportive from the very get-go, believing in our high ambitions and quality-focused approach to game development. We are very pleased to have them as our partners on this adventure and with their support, we can begin to realize the vision for our studio.</em></p>
<p>While those screenshots are indeed very reminiscent of a photorealistic version of Rockstar's GTA series, Liquid Swords is making a single player open world, narrative driven action RPG. We still don't know anything else, but hopefully that will change soon following these first screenshots.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be a very accessible game for newcomers, thanks to the implementation of some new features.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a>, producer Ryozo Tsujimoto commented on some of the new game mechanics, including those that are meant to ease newcomers into the experience, such as tutorials. These tutorials, which teach the basics of the experience, come with some options that allow players to tweak them to show as little or as much as they want. These tweaking options are certainly quite welcome, as they will not only help newcomers but will also allow more experienced players to hide them so that they can play without any hindrance right from the start. Tsujimoto-san also mentioned that players can get some help from Alma the handler to pick the weapon best suited for their play styles by replying to some questions. This feature was also available in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom demo</a> I had the chance to try out earlier this year, so it is likely it will be in next week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta/">open beta</a>, which seems to be based on the public demos, and in the final game as well.</p>
<p>Not every new feature in Monster Hunter Wilds was implemented just to help newcomers, however. The introduction of weapon switching, for example, is meant to provide players with more options and not break the gameplay action loop too much. As for why players can only bring two weapons, Tsujimoto-san confirmed it was to make things realistic, as being able to switch between all 14 types wouldn't have been so. Palicoes now being able to talk was also a change that was made to help the flow of action, as auditory cues are just better than visual ones in this regard. If players want, however, they can revert the Palicoes' voices to the meows of the previous entries in the series. Speaking of characters talking, Tsujimoto-san also confirmed that the hunter talking was a change made to help immersion, but players shouldn't expect them to speak a lot, as the team wanted to keep the tone of the series intact in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Thanks to feedback from Monster Hunter World, traversal has been improved considerably in the new entry in the series. The introduction of bigger, seamless maps proved to be somewhat of an issue for some players in the 2018 game, and with the bigger maps of Monster Hunter Wilds, Scoutflies wouldn't have been enough. With the technological advancements made in the past few years, the development team not only was able to implement the Seikret, but also to improve their AI so much that they can bring the player to the target monster by pressing a single button.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. Thanks to the aforementioned open beta, players on all formats will be able to try out the game next week.</p>
