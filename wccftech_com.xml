			<p>There's rather "interesting" news around Nintendo this weekend, as the firm is said to have sued a streamer who allegedly showed "unreleased and pirated" Nintendo Switch titles on public forums. In another development, Palword's developer Pocketpair has given insight into the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo, disclosing the amount they have been sued for.</p>
<p>Nintendo's track record of suing individuals and organizations and bringing them to court is pretty lengthy, and the firm has now decided to add another entry. In a new report by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-emulator-gamer-who-streamed-pirated-games-before-release-241108/">TorrentFreak</a>, Nintendo has filed a lawsuit against Jesse Keighin, or EveryGameGuru, saying that the individual is involved in leaking Nintendo's unreleased titles on multiple occasions. Keighin is accused of streaming on platforms such as YouTube, Discord, Twitch, TikTok, Trovo, Kick, Vaughn, Dlive, Picarto, Nimo, Facebook, and Loco. Here's what the lawsuit says:</p>
<p><em>Defendant is a recidivist pirate who has obtained and streamed Nintendo’s leaked games on multiple occasions. Leaked games (sometimes referred to as ‘prerelease games’) are copyrighted video games which Nintendo has not yet publicly released.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo says that they have rolled out multiple DMCA notices at Keighin's streams, but the streamer continued to show unauthorized gameplay, which ultimately forced Nintendo to adopt the legal approach. Interestingly, the pre-released in-game content shown wasn't simply of the title itself; rather, Keighin had access to pirated copies, which were played on an illegal emulator.</p>
<p><em>The use of emulators, which circumvent these technological measures, allow people such as Defendant to play pirated Nintendo Switch games — including leaked games — on PCs, Macs, and Android devices.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo claims that Keighin&nbsp;is responsible for pre-release streaming of titles such as Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and Super Mario RPG. Apart from this, Keighin is alleged to have encouraged infringement to its viewers as well, saying that he supplied "links" to pirated titles, ultimately being involved in extensive violation of Nintendo's copyright laws. Nintendo is seeking maximum statutory damages of $150,000 for the infringement by EveryGameGuru, which is indeed a hefty amount for an individual.</p>
<p>Nintendo isn't just after individuals like Keighin. Since the company is pretty committed to its copyright laws, we recently reported on how Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">filed a lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, the creators of Palworld, claiming that the developers allegedly infringed multiple patents on the title. Now, in a <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">follow-up post</a>, Pocketpair has revealed that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are now seeking compensation for damages incurred in the filing process, equaling five million yen ($32,846), to both parties.</p>
<p>The lawsuit comes at a pretty questionable time, especially since Palword has been out there for quite some time now, yet Nintendo has been quiet after the actual launch. It is uncertain how the lawsuit will turn out for the parties involved, but it is clear that Nintendo was surely influenced by the massive success of Palword.</p>

			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1854993555745362400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has officially gone gold. This means the game is done, and a master copy has been sent for mass production (the game will be released on physical discs for Xbox, in addition to digital).</p>
<p>In theory, this means no more delays are in order, although there's a famous precedent: CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-officially-gold-night-city-opens-november-19th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to have gone gold on October 5, 2020, ahead of its planned November 19, 2020 launch date. However, on October 27, the Polish developer was forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a short delay to December 10. The reasons would later become obvious, as even the delay was not enough to prevent a rough launch, especially on consoles.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 fans certainly hope this won't be the case, both regarding the delay and the rough debut. After all, this game already had to suffer through a long and tough road to get here. It's been over fifteen years since the last franchise entry, 2009's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat. The first attempt at a proper STALKER 2 project was immediately started by GSC Game World, which <a href="http://wccftech.com/stalker-2-set-release-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game in August 2010 for a tentative 2012 release window.</p>
<p>However, the Ukrainian studio was dissolved in December 2011, inevitably leading to the cancellation of that project. Luckily, that wasn't the end of the story. Evgeniy Grygorovych, brother of GSC Game World's original founder Sergiy Grygorovych, successfully resurrected the studio in late 2014. After making the real-time strategy game Cossacks 3, GSC Game World returned to what it really wanted to do: make STALKER 2. The new announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-in-development-targeting-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> in May 2018 with a targeted release window of 2021.</p>
<p>As time passed, the release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-debut-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved</a> to April 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-delayed-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a> to December 2022. But the disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced work on the game to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop</a> altogether for some time. GSC Game World subsequently went silent for a long while, and fans couldn't help but wonder whether their long-awaited sequel would ever materialize.</p>
<p>Finally, a playable demo was brought to Gamescom 2023, and the developers used it to gather feedback and further improve STALKER 2. In early 2024, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delay-final-release-date-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the game would launch on September 9, though we later discovered one final delay to the current date: November 20, when the game will be available on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
