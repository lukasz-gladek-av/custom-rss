			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a more challenging game than its predecessor, but a few mods released online in the past few days can make the experience more manageable and fun without breaking the difficulty and making the entire experience a walk in the park.</p>



<p>An essential mod to download, even for those who aren't finding the game too difficult, is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/21?">Always Have Compass Effect mod</a>, which always shows Hornet's position on the map without equipping the Compass, freeing up a charm slot for more beneficial effects. Unfortunately, this mod isn't compatible with the Game Pass version of the game.</p>



<p>Another Hollow Knight: Silksong mod that can make the experience more balanced without breaking difficulty is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/57">No More 2 Damage Plus mod</a>, which reduces every damage Hornet takes to just one point per hit. While this sounds like a small tweak, it's actually a rather big one against certain enemies with rapid-hitting attacks that can destroy Hornet quickly, making the game somewhat more fair.</p>



<p>The third and final Hollow Knight: Silksong mod, which can improve the experience considerably, is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/55?tab=description">All Enemies Drop Rosary Beads</a>, which does exactly what its name suggests, making every enemy in the game drop Rosary Beads when defeated, instead of just the few enemies in the vanilla game. The formula used to calculate how many Beads an enemy drops is based on the extra bead = floor(max health / 5), which some are finding to be a little too much, but if you don't care about breaking the in-game's economy, this is a very useful mod to install.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlaYStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is not precisely a puzzle-heavy survival horror game, but that doesn't mean that you won't have to collect and place items correctly or <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-whats-the-passcode-for-the-storeroom-lock/">discover passcodes</a> to open up locked doors. In most cases, doors locked with passcodes are not mandatory to unlock to proceed in the main mission, but they should still be opened to obtain always-needed resources and additional items that can be used to solve puzzles, which unlock new weapons when completed.</p>



<p>This is the case of the <strong>locked door found in the Hospital Director's room</strong>. The first time you encounter this room will be while The Traveler has to explore Unity Hospital to obtain three samples to synthesize the Biomass Dissolving Toxin. No sample is hidden inside this room, but you will still want to open it to <strong>get an item required to complete the Chapel's puzzle located near the main save point on the first floor of the Hospital.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shooting gas cans in Cronos: The New Dawn is often the solution to puzzles</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>To discover the passcode</strong>, you must proceed in the same wing as the Director's Room until you reach a massive room with a lot of Biomass. From this room's entrance, head to the left until you reach <strong>a blocked door on your left, and a crouching point in front of you</strong>. Press the X or B button to enter a new area and then turn to the left where you will find a window with a broken window looking into the locked room. Shoot the gas can to burn the Biomass blocking the door to be able to enter the room, grab every item, and check the document, which will tell you the locked room passcode: <strong>9509</strong>. You can also input the passcode directly without discovering the document first, in case you are not in the mood for some exploration.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Chalice found inside the locked room in Cronos: The New Dawn Hospital Director's room</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Inside the room, you will find some resources as well as the Chalice, which can be used to complete the aforementioned Chapel puzzle and, in turn, obtain the Mace JER-5120 shotgun, a modified variant of the regular Hammer shotgun which trades charged shots with a powerful double shot.</p>

			<p>Like many modern games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> hardly ends when the main campaign is completed. After experiencing one of the two endings and seeing the credits roll, a couple of new play modes are unlocked - <strong>New Game Plus and Hard Mode.</strong> While at a glance, Hard Mode may have more to offer to those who mastered the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">core mechanics</a>, <strong>New Game Plus may be more worthwhile to go through</strong>, as it provides something to those who have enjoyed the game's story.</p>



<p>Regarding gameplay differences, New Game Plus mode in Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't offer much. <strong>Item and enemy placement will be the same as in the first playthrough</strong>, so you should be able to breeze through this mode with relative ease, considering you will<strong> keep every upgrade unlocked during your first playthrough</strong>. As such, playing the game again in New Game Plus mode is the only way to <strong>unlock some of the Trophies and Achievements</strong>, including the May It Serve You Fault-Free achievement for fully upgrading a single weapon, The Praetorian for fully upgrading every weapon, and Forged In Fire for fully upgrading the Temporal Shell.</p>



<p><em><strong>SPOILER ALERT - Avoid reading below the screenshot if you haven't completed the game, as there are plenty of spoilers ahead regarding late-game beats and endings.</strong></em></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn New Game Plus mode has a lot to offer to those who enjoyed the game's storyu</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, even if you aren't a Trophy or Achievement hunter, you will have a very good reason to complete Cronos: The New Dawn's New Game Plus mode if you have loved the game's story. After defeating The Pathfinder on the Clocktower at the end of the game, you will be presented with<strong> three choices</strong> instead of two, and by picking the <strong>Begin Anew</strong> choice, you will unlock <strong>Ending C</strong>, which is, possibly, the most hopeful ending of the three, and one that all those who liked the story will surely appreciate.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-requirements-accessible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-official-vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-pc-requirements-are-quite-accessible.1291221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With only about a month and a half before the game's launch, developer The Chinese Room and publisher Paradox Interactive have shared the official PC requirements for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-qa-lot-subtleties-to-movement-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> on the store pages where players can pre-order the game.</p>



<p>Bloodlines 2 is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5. However, the game does not boast any particularly advanced technology like ray tracing, and indeed, the stated minimum and recommended requirements won't be a problem for most gamers, and the game doesn't require much hard drive space, either.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)<br>Processor: Intel Core i3-8350K | AMD Ryzen 3 3300X<br>Memory: 8 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) | AMD Radeon RX 480 (8GB) | Intel Arc A580 (8GB, Resizable BAR enabled) | AMD Radeon 780M<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 30 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 11<br>Processor: Intel Core i5-12600K | AMD Ryzen 5 5600X<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (8GB) | AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT (12GB)<br>DirectX: Version 12<br>Storage: 30 GB available space</p>



<p>Still, we do not know the intended target resolution, frame rate, and graphics preset for the minimum and recommended specs. Moreover, during <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pre-gamescom-2025-hands-on-a-tasty-morsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my recent test of a preview build</a>, I could not help but notice that the dreadful Unreal Engine traversal stuttering was indeed present.</p>



<p>I said as much to the developers of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 when I met them at Gamescom 2025. Hopefully, they can do something to alleviate those issues, making the experience smoother on PC. It is not impossible - a few Unreal Engine games do not suffer as much stuttering as the others, Silent Hill f being one example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-smooth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Digital Foundry pre-release test</a>.</p>



<p>In other Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 news, the Community Manager revealed a small update regarding the promised <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-publisher-promises-fix-clans-locked-day-one-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweaks for the Premium Edition and day-one Silk &amp; Song paid DLC</a>. The news will be shared on Wednesday, September 17; meanwhile, PlayStation users who had pre-ordered the Premium Edition through the PlayStation Store have been refunded. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subscription-services-aren%E2%80%99t-properly-rewarding-content-makers-says-ex-bethesda-executive-and-former-xbox-executive-agrees.1291197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Bethesda Head of Publishing and Communication Pete Hines was recently featured <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines">in an interview with Dbltap</a>, which included a rather harsh criticism of subscription services like Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Hines opined that, at least as far as he knew before <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesdas-pete-hines-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving Bethesda in October 2023</a>, content makers weren't being properly rewarded when their games were added to these subscription services. </p>



<p><em>I'm not working in any of these companies anymore, and so I don't assume that everything I knew while I was in the industry still holds true today. At the same time, I'm involved enough to know I saw what I considered to be some short sighted decision making several years ago, and it seems to be bearing out the way I said. Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore. When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content – without which your subscription is worth jack shit – then you have a real problem. You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product. That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.</em></p>



<p>Hines, who obviously had experience with Game Pass (Bethesda was bought by Xbox a couple of years before he left the company and immediately started putting games on Microsoft's gaming subscription service), was backed in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brief LinkedIn message</a> by former Xbox executive Shannon Loftis, who spent nearly 30 years at Microsoft and was most recently VP of Xbox Game Studios before leaving the company in June 2022. Here's what she said:</p>



<p><em>As a longtime first-party Xbox developer, I can attest that Pete is correct. While Game Pass can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves (Human Fall Flat, e.g.), the majority of game adoption on Game Pass comes at the expense of retail revenue unless the game is engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization. I could (and may someday) write pages on the weird inner tensions this creates.</em></p>



<p>After some stagnation, though, subscription services spending grew significantly in June 2025 in the US, registering a record month with $562 million, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37olha22k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Circana's Senior Director Mat Piscatella</a>. Of course, that doesn't mean that the game developers and publishers who provided the games have been adequately rewarded. Still, it does mean that the likes of Microsoft and Sony will continue seeking to invest in the business model.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the aforementioned interview, Pete Hines revealed that his biggest regret while at Bethesda was the Fallout 76 Collector's Edition snafu. As you might recall, it was supposed to include a canvas bag, but it was replaced at the last minute with a cheaper nylon bag, leading to fans' outrage. At first, users <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-millions-playing-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were only given 500 Atoms for compensation</a>, and Hines himself did not push to replace the nylon bag with the promised canvas bag as soon as possible. Eventually, though, he realized the mistake, and the canvas bag was sent to those who had ordered that edition.</p>
