			<p>While heavy hitters like <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/"><strong>Tekken 8</strong></a></em>, and <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> will continue to be updated with new characters and balance changes, which should be even more interesting for the <strong>Bandai Namco</strong> game following series creator Katsuhiro Harada's departure, 2026 will also see the release of some major fighting games. This is set to make it a landmark year for the fighting game community, particularly for those interested in <strong>tag fighting games</strong>.</p>



<p>Luckily, <strong>2026 will also offer plenty to those who prefer traditional 1-versus-1 fighting games</strong> with the launch of a new game based on a successful franchise and a massive overhaul of one of the best fighting games of the current console generation.</p>



<p>Here are our <strong>five most anticipated fighting games</strong> launching in 2026.</p>

<h2 id="h-invincible-vs-april-30-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"><strong>Invincible VS</strong> (April 30, 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<p>Combining the <strong>technicality of Japanese fighting games</strong> with the <strong>visceral impact of Western fighting games</strong>, <em>Invincible VS</em> is sure to leave a mark on the scene when it launches later this year.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Avatar-Legends-The-Fighting-Game.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>In Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game</em>, you will<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> master the four elements in a hand-drawn 2D fighter that looks exactly like the original series.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After cutting their teeth with <em>Them's Fighting Herds</em>, Gameplay Group is ready to leave a more lasting impact on the fighting game genre with <em>Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game.</em></p>



<p>A 1v1 fighter featuring a support characters system, the game focuses on a unique <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Flow System"</strong> that rewards movement-based element bending to deliver a unique fighting game experience  Launching with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">12 playable characters</strong>, including popular characters like <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Aang</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Korra</strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zuko</strong>, rendered with hand-drawn 2D visuals, playing the game will feel like watching an episode of the successful show. </p>



<p><span>With&nbsp;<strong>rollback netcode</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>cross-play</strong>&nbsp;confirmed for its Summer 2026 launch, <em>Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game</em> </span>is a serious contender for both casual fans and the competitive FGC.</p>



<h2 id="h-2xko-january-20-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s"><strong>2XKO</strong> (January 20, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2XKO.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>2XKO officially launches on PC and consoles this year</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you checked out our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">best fighting games of 2025 list</a></strong>, you may find the inclusion of 2XKO in this list weird. However, there's a good reason why the tag fighter set in the world of League of Legends is also one of the most anticipated fighting games launching in 2026.</p>



<p>After years in development as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Project L</em> and its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC early access release</strong></a>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">2XKO</em> officially launches <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/">its console versions and full Season 1 this January</a></strong>. This free-to-play 2v2 tag-team fighter is built from the ground up to be accessible yet competitive, featuring some deep tag mechanics that provide players with a lot of options and a "Duo Play" mode that allows four players to compete at once. </p>



<p>Launching alongside a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2026 Competitive Series</strong> featuring 20 sanctioned tournaments, Riot is positioning <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2XKO</em></strong> to be the next big pillar of the fighting game community. And with the developer knowing more than a few things about supporting a competitive game for years, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">2XKO</em> is likely here to stay for a very long time.</p>

<p>While not a "new" game in the traditional sense, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Arc System Works</strong> has confirmed that 2026 will see the launch of<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/"><strong>Guilty Gear -Strive-</strong></a> Version 2.0</em>, a massive overhaul that will reportedly be rather big.</p>



<p>This substantial shift in gameplay philosophy, as described by producer Ken Miyauchi, will coincide with the start of&nbsp;Season 5,&nbsp;which is expected to introduce additional characters following the addition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners'</em></strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lucy</strong> to the roster in late 2025.</p>



<p>With new universal mechanics, reworked move sets for the base roster, and a significant graphical improvement to enhance what are some of the best visuals seen in fighting games, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Guilty Gear -Strive- Version 2.0</em> has every right to be among the most anticipated fighting games of the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although the <strong>PC market</strong> has significantly gotten bigger over the years, consoles like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/">PlayStation 5</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/">Nintendo Switch</a></strong>, and its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">successor</a></strong> released last year continue to dominate the video games market as a whole in many regions of the world.</p>



<p>However, the increased number of releases on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC storefronts</strong> of the past few years indicates that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">something is shifting</strong>. So much so that some celebrated game creators believe that the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC market has become dominant</strong> at this point.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19255-the-hundred-line-interview-kodaka-dlc-new-characters-routes-uchikoshi-switch-2">RPG Site</a></em></strong> focused on his latest game, <strong><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></strong>, <strong><em>Danganronpa</em></strong> series creator <strong>Kazutaka Kodaka</strong> was asked about the game's excellent PC port. His reply leaves no room for interpretation: <strong><em>"The market is dominated by PC now,"</em></strong> he said. <strong><em>"Releasing worldwide on Steam is essential."</em></strong></p>



<p>While <strong>Kodaka-san</strong> didn't add more about the matter, his confirmation that the team is <strong>not considering PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports</strong> of <strong><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></strong> makes it clear how much the market seems to be leaving traditional home consoles behind, <strong>shifting towards PC</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pc-become-the-unified-gaming-platform">Will PC Become the Unified Gaming Platform?</h2>



<p>Following the heights of the early 2020s, when people spent more time at home playing video games due to the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, the video game market has been experiencing some <strong>turbulent times</strong>, putting the traditional business model that has held so far in question.</p>



<p>A few days ago, former Chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios <strong>Shawn Layden</strong> highlighted in an interview how the <strong>total install base of console users hasn't changed much</strong> in the past few generations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-trapped-in-this-containment-field-former-sony-exec-proposes-single-gaming-format-to-expand-console-market/"><strong>proposing the creation of a consortium</strong></a> in the vein of those which pushed for unified formats like the <strong>VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray</strong> to make the video games industry move towards a <strong>single gaming format</strong> that could be licensed out.</p>



<p>With releasing games on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Steam for PC</strong> seemingly having become <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">essential</strong>, and both <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Microsoft and Sony</strong> increasing their focus on this market, it definitely feels like the industry may already be moving towards a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unified gaming format centered on the platform</strong>, whose appeal has further increased with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">handheld gaming systems</strong> like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck</a></strong> and <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbo</a></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">x</a></strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/"> Ally</a></strong>.</p>



<p>With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rising-ram-prices-could-be-the-next-big-problem-for-pc-gamers/">massive price spike for RAM</a></strong> due to the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-cost-increase-allegedly-behind-microsofts-rumored-new-massive-round-of-job-cuts/">AI craze</a></strong>, which is set to increase the price of almost every electronic device significantly, however, this move could be <strong>considerably delayed</strong>, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-industry-as-a-whole-is-concerned-about-ram-availability-heres-why-the-playstation-6-and-xbox-next-could-be-delayed-past-2027-2028/">current console generation could be extended</a></strong> until the situation normalizes.</p>

<p>A new comparison video <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">created by&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmarkPC</strong>&nbsp;showcases the game running with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5,</strong>&nbsp;featuring the second-generation transformer model, side by side at&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1440p and 4K resolutions</strong>, with&nbsp;</span>ultra settings in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Quality, Balanced, and Performance</strong> modes on an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 5080</strong> GPU.</p>



<p>The considerable image quality improvements over <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4</strong> are evident in the side-by-side comparison at <strong>1440p resolution</strong> in <strong>Quality mode</strong>, but even more impressive is how the new transformer model delivers <strong>better image quality than native resolution</strong>. This is easily noticeable with the <strong>terrain and grass</strong>, which look considerably sharper with <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Super Resolution transformer model</strong> isn't perfect, as it seems to have some trouble <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">rendering leaves on trees</strong> correctly. In almost every instance, the trees look <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">noticeably worse</strong>. Still, considering the overall image quality, what <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong> is capable of <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">achieving is truly impressive, even with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-dlss-4-5-testing-reveals-drastically-crisper-details-but-older-gen-rtx-gpus-take-nearly-20-performance-hit/"><strong>widely reported&nbsp;performance impact</strong></a></span> over the previous Super Resolution models in every game tested so far. This performance impact, however, remains small on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RTX 50 and 40 series</strong> thanks to the use of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">FP8</strong> in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blackwell and Ada GPUs</strong>.</p>

This is to be expected, considering this is the new model's first release, which is only going to get improved in the future.</p>
