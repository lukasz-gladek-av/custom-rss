			<p>This coming November 7, 2025, will mark the first anniversary of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-unboxing/">PS5 Pro's launch</a>, a console that, in a physical sense, marked the halfway point of the PlayStation 5 generation, and the deeper we get into the PS5's life cycle, the closer we get to PlayStation 6. While pretty much everything we've heard about the next generation of PlayStation is rumors and speculation, a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/">Insider-Gaming</a> does make a good deal of sense, that the coming PS6 will launch with a detachable disc drive.</p>



<p>The reality of PlayStation consoles having <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-slim-drive-multiple-consoles/">a detachable disc drive is already here</a>, and has been the case since 2023, so it's not in the least surprising that Sony and PlayStation would look to make the next console generation compatible with its current manufacturing process, which, according to Insider-Gaming's report, is one of the reasons behind the decision. According to its sources, PlayStation will sell the PS6 the same way it currently sells the PS5.</p>



<p>You'll be able to buy a PlayStation 6 with a disc drive pre-attached and bundled in, or buy it without the disc drive, with the option to add it later if you wish, by buying the disc drive on its own.</p>



<p>Besides the manufacturing reasons, it's also been previously pointed out that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-discless/">PlayStation isn't ready to release a digital-only console</a>. That said, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">rumored handheld PlayStation</a> won't have a disc drive, and the fact that the drives are already an option shows how PlayStation is inching towards a digital-only future. At least for now, players who still care about buying physical discs still have that option.</p>
