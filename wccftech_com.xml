			<p>When buying Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games at retail, customers won't need any further downloads, at least if the games have been published by Nintendo. The same may not necessarily be true for third-party publishers, though. The lingering question was finally answered by a company spokesperson in a statement <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Vooks.net</a>:</p>
<p><em>The physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e., they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.</em></p>
<p>So far, the following games will allow customers to upgrade:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ($69.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (currently unknown price)</li>
<li>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Switch 2 + Star-Crossed World ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV ($79.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma (third-party; $69.99 or $9.99 if you already own the original)</li>
<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A (currently unknown price)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as many had assumed, Nintendo also confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will not include that game's Expansion Pass. Following the launch, Nintendo released two DLCs: The Master Trials and The Champions' Ballad. It is presently unclear, although likely, if players will be able to purchase them separately on the new console.</p>

			<p>There are a lot of fantastic sights and sounds to take in on Hazel's journey to the small town of Prospero. But there's also plenty to read as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> shines brightest with its storytelling, and that includes all the little notes you can find along your journey. Each of them adds a bit of context to the events you're experiencing and learning about.</p>
<p>They can also add a welcomed dose of historical context at times, digging into some of the tragedies that people in this fictional town faced that pull from real-life horrors. That's why it's well worth your time to seek out all 103 notes you can read in South of Midnight.</p>
<p>Starting with Chapter 1, we'll take you through where to find every single note.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 1</h2>
<p>There are only 3 notes to find in the first chapter of the game, and they're all in Bunny's house. So don't worry about looking around for anything until Hazel wakes up in Bunny's house after the night of the storm.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny's note to Lily on tea</strong> - You can find this note in the room where Hazel wakes up. Look to your right, where you'll see a desk and a mirror. On that desk is the first note and the first layer of Bunny's character beginning to unravel.</p>

<p><strong>Bunny's journal entry, 1982&nbsp;</strong>- This note and the next are both in the same room, Bunny's office. You'll climb into this room by climbing the ledges around the house, and you'll find this note on the desk to your left when you enter the room.</p>
<p><strong>Bunny's journal entry, 1989 &amp; 2003</strong> - You'll find these two journal entries as one note on the red chair, immediately in front of you when you enter Bunny's office.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>And that's all the notes for Chapter 1 in South of Midnight. Only 100 more to go!</p>
