            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the years and with plenty of solid work, developer Cyanide established the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-shards-darkness-review-crafty/">Styx </a>series as one of the most important stealth series still running today, combining a dark fantasy medieval world with a personable main character and some advanced gameplay mechanics to provide experiences like few others. The hardcore approach of the franchise will be turned up to eleven by Styx: Blades of Greed, which is setting out to become the biggest and most complex entry in the series to date.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month, I had the chance to try out Styx: Blades of Greed in one of the longest session I had booked for this year's show, and, after a brief presentation, it was clear why I was given one hour and half to try out the game. Not counting the sheer size of the open map, which was really massive, featuring a focus on verticality that only opens a lot of possibilities, but also made it feel even bigger, Styx: Blades of Greed is a game that doesn't pull any punches. Though there was a bit of clunkiness to the experience, with some rather complex controls that required a little time to get used to, and enemies sometimes failing to spot Styx even though he was in plain view ahead of them, the experience was as hardcore as it could have been.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Styx: Blades of Greed is as hardcore as a stealth game can get.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not counting the above issues, which will likely get ironed out by the time the game comes out, enemies are highly attentive to their surroundings, forcing the player to take advantage of every hiding point or shadow in the environment, and are relentless in their pursuit of Styx if he is discovered, giving up the search only when the goblin is properly concealed, and out of the way. As Styx is not very good at direct combat, a stealthy approach is always the winning one in Styx: Blades of Greed, forcing players to think hard and proceed even more carefully, and to make them take full advantage of the environment by snuffing out candles to create shadows, where he is more difficult to spot, by making noise to distract enemies, or by simply choosing a safer route with fewer enemies. Thanks to a waypoint system, the general area where the main objective is located is easily highlighted, making it easier for players to focus on sneaking around without having to worry about getting lost.</p>



<p>Besides Styx's excellent agility, which allows him to climb pretty much anywhere to take advantage of the aforementioned improved verticality of the maps, the goblin also has many different abilities that can be learned via skill trees. These abilities were extremely varied in the Gamescom demo, ranging from creating clones to fight and distract enemies, setting down a coccoon to be used as a respawn and teleportation point, mind control, and more. These abilities further highlighted how this sandbox approach to level design is a great direction to take the series to, as the massive freedom left to players makes it very involving and engaging. With other tools added to the mix, like a grappling hook and a glider, it will really be interesting to see how stealth game experts will put everything at Styx's disposal to use.</p>



<p>Though a little complex at times, the Styx: Blades of Greed Gamescom demo did an excellent job showcasing how the third entry in the series will elevate the franchise to new heights. With the abilities and tools on show being so diverse and versatile, I'm really interested to see what else the game will offer when it launches this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-is-us-director-calls-silksong%E2%80%99s-two-week-heads-up-%E2%80%9Ca-little-callous%E2%80%9D.1298118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Excitement and hype have been building around Hollow Knight Silksong's release <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">for years</a>, so it was no surprise when its launch, which occurred 11 days ago at the time of this writing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">was a big deal</a>. Several <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">indie games delayed their launches to get out of Silksong's way</a> to try to avoid every ounce of attention being swallowed by Silksong, but others, like Hell is Us, stuck it out, proudly launching alongside Silksong on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Now that both games are out, and developer Rogue Factor survived the first week and a half of launching alongside Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel, Hell is Us director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête had a few thoughts on how Team Cherry handled launching the most wishlisted game on Steam.</p>



<p>"<em>I mean, they're allowed to do what they did,</em>" began Jacques-Belletête when answering what it was like finding out they'd be releasing the same day as Silksong on an episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y">Friends Per Second</a> podcast per <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/">TWIV</a>. "<em>There's no laws or rules against that. And I don't want to get into, 'Oh they caused this to us or somebody else.' I don't really care about that, and I don't want to get into that type of debate. But I do, it's hard for me not to say, like, when you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like wow. You know what I mean? As the GTA VI of indie, right? And I know now this term gets thrown around left and right, but people in the industry, that's how we were</em> <em>calling such a game. To shadow drop something like this is a little callous.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="'Hell is Us' Game Director on what worked (and didn't) | Friends Per Second Ep #78" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/opeNl55y-0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jacques-Belletête also confirmed that there were conversations between Rogue Factor and its publisher, Nacon, regarding whether Hell is Us should be delayed, and that while it wasn't the deciding factor, at least one point of friction against that decision would be having to refund pre-orders, and hope those players purchase them again for the new date.</p>



<p>"<em>The real pain in the ass is that you have to refund your pre-orders when you do that, right? That's the real, 'How you gonna do this?' now you need to rebuild them. We didn't say 'Oh my god, we have to do it but we can't because of that.' We were like, 'No, I think we can get through the storm.'"</em></p>



<p>Obviously, Hell is Us kept its date, which Jacques-Belletête says he was "<em>happy</em>" about, and noted that Rogue Factor is still a larger studio than several of the other indies that delayed their games, which went into the team believing they could weather the storm of Silksong.</p>



<p>But while he doesn't have any hard numbers, it's his belief that Silksong did impact the launch sales of Hell is Us. "<em>I don't have any specific numbers, at least not at this time. But for sure it did</em>." He continued to say that it's not just about Hollow Knight, but about how it's practically impossible to find a release window where you aren't going up against a big upcoming title.</p>



<p>"<em>That's the thing nowadays, getting a window where you're pretty much alone</em> <em>is almost impossible. 15 years ago, the mid-end of the summer was always a dead period. But there's no such thing anymore. It's just constant madness</em>."</p>



<p>When we start looking at sales reports for September, it'll be interesting to see where Hell is Us lands on the charts, especially if it lands within a few places of Silksong. As Jacques-Belletête pointed out, there are no laws against what Team Cherry did, and it's difficult for everyone in the industry, no matter who you are, to draw the ever-shrinking attention spans of modern players away from the hundreds of other options they have to any one game. But it seems odd to even suggest that Team Cherry, or any other studio in its place, owes other studios the courtesy of a long lead time. </p>



<p>Team Cherry launched Hollow Knight Silksong in the way that it did with the intention of getting as many eyes as possible on it for September 4. Rogue Factor did the same with its own strategy. Is that callousness, or competitiveness?</p>



<p>For more on Hell is Us,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/"> you can check out my review</a>, in which I noted that despite a few flaws, Rogue Factor is largely able to succeed at what it is trying to do with Hell is Us, and that it is overall "<em>one of the 2025's best games</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-xbox-series-s-technical-limitations-made-battlefield-6-a-better-more-stable-game.1298040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-series-s/">Xbox Series S </a>version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> was challenging due to the console's technical limitations, but optimizing the game for the system ultimately made the game better and more stable.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">Kotaku</a>, Technical Director Christian Buhl commented on the challenges of developing the sixth entry in the series launching next month on the Microsoft system, saying that the biggest challenge was dealing with the console's limited memory, which was less than that of the studio's mid-spec PCs, and that caused crashing issues in a lot of the levels. Due to these issues, the team focused on optimizing memory usage in Battlefield 6, and these improvements were also applied to the other versions of the game, resulting in a better and more stable game. The specific optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version also didn't take a very long time, as the memory issues were reportedly fixed in one month or two, according to Buhl.</p>



<p>Although the Battlefield 6 developer managed to find an opportunity in the development challenges the Xbox Series S poses with its technical limitations compared to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S, many more developers have found these challenges to be a serious issue not easily solved. One of these developers is Saber Interactive, which hasn't managed to make the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-cant-run-turok-origins-60-fps/">Turok: Origins</a> run at 60 FPS on the system. Memory limitations were one of the reasons why <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-split-screen-xbox-series-s-challenge/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> took a long time to release on Xbox systems. For the latter to launch on Xbox systems, Microsoft had to amend its parity clause and let Larian launch their games without split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S, which was later added to this version of the game with a patch.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-nitendo-switch-2-held-back-cpu/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unreal-engine-5-games-on-nintendo-switch-2-are-likely-held-back-by-the-system%E2%80%99s-cpu.1298019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Games powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are likely held back by the system's CPU, and some engine updates, taking the system's specifications into account, will be required to implement some of the engine's trademark features on the console.</p>



<p>In a new analysis shared on YouTube, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tPvLuU_JxQ">Digital Foundry</a> take a look at the Unreal Engine 5-powered games now available on Nintendo Switch 2, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Fortnite, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a>, highlighting how all three games do not sport the engine's headline features like Lumen and Nanite. The fact that they are missing in Fortnite, in particular,  is rather telling, as it heavily suggests how the engine doesn't yet have a good preset to make an already released game run with these features at acceptable performance on Nintendo's new system. Having a high lower-level barrier to running high-level features like Lumen, Naninte and Virtual Shadow Maps, Cronos: The New Dawn and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/">Borderlands 4</a>, which will only launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next month, struggle to run smoohtly on a CPU like the Ryzen 5 3600, leading to a variety of issues, including traversal stuttering, which would be a lot worse on a slower CPU like the Switch 2's.</p>



<p>How the Nintendo Switch 2 CPU holds back Unreal Engine 5 games is made clearer by how Fortnite runs on the system. As highlighted in the Digital Foundry analysis, there are some sort of "transition zones" used to load new elements into the game, which show some frametime issues that would be significantly worse if the most demanding UE5 features were in. As such, at the current stage, there's likely no way to scale down these features to a level the Nintendo Switch 2 could handle them, having been developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S specs in mind, especially their CPUs, which are much faster than the Switch 2's. Like in the other consoles' case, it will take some dedicated work and some updates to create a good profile to run games with Lumen and Nanite on Nintendo Switch 2 at acceptable performance.</p>

<iframe title="Switch 2 vs Unreal Engine - Fortnite, Cronos + Split Fiction Tested - The Full-Fat UE5 Experience?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tPvLuU_JxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although it was suggested before release that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/">Nintendo Switch 2 CPU shouldn't have been a problem for games</a>, it looks like it is the most challenging aspect of the system, and not only in Unreal Engine 5 games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">The state of the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Gamescom demo</a> also suggested how the system's CPU is impacting performance significantly, requiring more optimization work to make games run at acceptable, playable framerates.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gearbox-boss-tells-%E2%80%984k-stubborn%E2%80%99-players-to-switch-to-1440p-or-use-dlss-in-borderlands-4-in-place-of-native-rendering.1297989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox is probably happy overall about the Borderlands 4 launch, which quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke series records</a> for concurrent players active on the Steam platform and did it again this weekend, topping 304K players sixteen hours ago. However, it also has to deal with performance complaints for the PC version, which have been voiced loudly in over 16 thousand and a half Steam reviews, which are currently 'Mixed' (67% rating).</p>



<p>Gearbox Software co-founder and president Randy Pitchford tried to address the performance <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966952362293273013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a lengthy X thread</a>, alleging that there are some '4K stubborn' PC players who either don't have the hardware to run the game at Ultra HD resolution and should switch to 1440P, or perhaps do not want to use upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS even if they have access to them.</p>



<p><em>I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4K with ultra max settings and using 2-3 year old hardware. You do you, but Borderlands 4 and UE5 are doing a lot, and for me, that trade-off for frames isn’t worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade-off - the game looks amazing at 1440p. If you’re not 4K stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you’ve got a beast of a video card, you’re probably fine at 4K. But if you’re in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade.</em></p>



<p><em>If you have a DLSS option, use it! Especially if you’re trying to run at resolutions higher than 1080p. This is a campaign game - you’re not competing in high-stakes esports here. The input latency is so insanely negligible that less than .01% of the population could reliably detect it without tools in a blind test. Take the W on frame rate and use this incredible tech with DLSS on.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, many comments that can be read not only on Steam but also on Reddit, X, and other social channels are from users who insist on using native rendering only. As seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-benchmarks-best-looking-borderlands-to-date-but-also-the-most-heaviest-to-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's benchmarks</a>, even the most powerful graphics card available on the market, NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 5090, stops at around 48 frames per second with maxed settings and 4K native resolution. But games are not designed anymore to be running at native resolution, and to be honest, they haven't been for a long time on either PC or consoles. Besides, with the latest NVIDIA DLSS transformer model and AMD FSR 4 (which can be enabled at a driver level by 9000 series users), the visual quality is excellent and the performance gains are massive.</p>



<p>The Gearbox executive eventually <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered</a> one such comment that invited the studio to make their game 'look good without AI upscale'. As usual, Pitchford did not mince words:</p>



<p><em>Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please. We will be your customer when you pull it off. The people doing it now are clearly dumb and don’t know what they’re doing and all the support and recommendations and code and architecture from the world’s greatest hardware companies and tech companies working with the world’s greatest real time graphics engine coders don’t know what you seem to know.</em></p>



<p>While there is an argument to be made that Borderlands 4 perhaps doesn't look as good as it should for how taxing it is on hardware, and Gearbox absolutely has work to do to improve performance through patches, deliberately choosing to keep AI upscaling disabled when both current hardware and software are designed with that in mind feels like living in the past.</p>



<p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the studio <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/discussions/1/596285654384685820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> there is no spyware in the game. The first PC mods have already been uploaded to Nexus, and we've listed a few useful ones <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-borderlands-4-mods-remove-outlines-bloom-fog-tweak-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this article</a>.</p>
