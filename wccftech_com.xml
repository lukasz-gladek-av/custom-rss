			<p>Developer and publisher Exor Studios has just released the latest update for The Riftbreaker, which includes a few significant features for the game. Update 2.0 introduces four-player online co-op to The Riftbreaker, along with an expanded campaign, an overhaul to the loot system, new Omega-Strain creatures, and more.</p>



<p>The update is available right now for PC players through Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG, though Windows Store players and players on console will have to wait, as the update will be available there "<em>at a later date</em>," according to the studio in a press release.</p>



<p>Exor Studios also debuted a new trailer for the update, which showcases co-op gameplay, some of the new creatures you'll face, and shots of the expanded campaign for veterans looking for more to do in the endgame.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the expanded campaign, this update introduces a new story arc centering around Megastructures, and is fully voiced with Francesca Meaux and Ryan Laughton returning to their roles as Ashley and Mr. Riggs, respectively. </p>



<p>The Omega-Strain creatures are more powerful versions of existing creatures and enemies you've already faced, though thanks to their added punch, taking them down will score you an even bigger reward. They also feature various elemental types that will encourage you to switch up your approach depending on the situation.</p>



<p>Exor Studios has also overhauled the loot system with Update 2.0, and crafting is no longer the only way to obtain new gear. You'll now see new gear appear as loot from enemy creatures, Biocaches, and Bioanomalies. There's also a number of balance adjustments in the update, including tweaks to weapons, research, quality-of-life improvements, and even a few optimization improvements to help the game perform better on your device.</p>



<p>The Riftbreaker is a base-building action-RPG that<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-riftbreaker-an-ephemeral-paradise/"> first launched in 2021</a>, and has been updated several times since launch, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-riftbreaker-metal-terror-dlc-more-of-the-same/">new expansions</a> and balancing updates. </p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> Dune Awakening Game Director Joel Bylos to discuss the game's launch on PC and the upcoming updates planned for the survival sandbox MMO. Among the various topics, we also inquired about the status of the console versions, which have long been scheduled for release. According to Bylos, the game will debut next year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, with an internal estimate that it should take around a year.</p>



<p><em>We're working towards a launch on console sometime next year. We've just begun after launch, and started really digging into it. I've seen it running on a PlayStation 5, but there were a lot of texture issues, still a lot of work to do, and then we have to do all the different requirements for the different consoles and optimize the game shaders to work properly with the different console hardware, so there's work to do. We usually assume that it's going to take us about a year to get it up and running properly on a console. So yeah, sometime next year, now, probably we will have one launch at the same time as GTA VI laughs.</em></p>



<p>If so, Dune Awakening could be available on those platforms sometime in the Summer of 2026. Funcom is still unclear whether it will be able to support cross-play, though it would like to:  </p>



<p><em>It's still on the conversations we're having with Microsoft and PlayStation to decide that, so we haven't actually made a decision, but from our technical standpoint, it's no problem for us because we run these servers and the games will connect to our service. So it's not a problem, but it depends on what the platform holders have to say; we need to have those conversations. We haven't had them yet.</em></p>



<p>It should be noted that Microsoft and Sony (PlayStation) haven't really had a problem with cross-play for at least a couple of years. Nowadays, it has become the standard for new online multiplayer games, so if that's the only obstacle, chances are Dune Awakening players will indeed be able to play in the same version of Arrakis.</p>
