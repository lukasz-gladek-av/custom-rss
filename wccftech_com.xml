			<p>Today, Microsoft did what has become something of a habit for the company: raised the price of playing games on Xbox. This time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">instead of the consoles getting a price hike</a>, it was Xbox Game Pass this time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">with a 50% price jump for Game Pass and the overhauling of its three tiers</a>, which are now called Essential, Premium, and Ultimate.</p>



<p>Well, shortly after the news broke, <a href="https://x.com/_sunday_rain_/status/1973396317838684668">Pocket Tactics writer Sam Comrie</a> shared to X (formerly Twitter) that, perhaps somewhat unsurprisingly, the page to cancel your Xbox Game Pass subscription had essentially broken, likely thanks to an influx of users who decided they did not want to be paying $30/month for Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Users in the comments shared they were also having trouble accessing the cancel page, though for many more, the issues seem to have now been resolved, and you should have no problem cancelling your subscription.</p>



<p>Not everyone will move to cancel their subscriptions from this price hike; in fact it could be the case that many simply adjust their subscriptions from the top Ultimate tier and bump down to Premium or Essential based on their needs. </p>



<p>But this response to the latest price increases is just a sample size of what will continue to happen as playing games on Xbox gets more expensive. We know that Xbox won't be getting a return on its investments through hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/">especially with major retailers dropping the consoles entirely</a>.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">growth Microsoft previously reported for Game Pass</a> continues through its next fiscal year. Especially when considering that the company is apparently making its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">"<em>largest investment to date</em>" in the service</a>. </p>

			<p>Marvel Rivals' next update, Season 4.5, launches next week on October 10, 2025, adding Daredevil to the roster as a new duelist. Beyond a new character, next week's update will add the beginnings of a highly requested feature: cross-platform progression support. The catch, unfortunately, is that it'll only be live for players invited to try it out, while everyone else will have to wait for cross-progression support to be available to all players with Season 5's launch.</p>



<p>As is routine with every major Marvel Rivals season update, developer NetEase has debuted two new videos. The first is a gameplay trailer showing off Daredevil gameplay and each of his skill and abilities in action. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The second is a Dev Vision video featuring the game's creative director, Guangguang, going over the key changes in the coming season, including being able to customize the background of your home screen, and how cross-platform progression will work once it's live for all users.</p>



<p>You'll be able to access a main character across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, though your statistics and rankings will be separate for each platform. </p>

<p>Guangguang also teased that a new mode is going to be added to the game, with details set to premiere on October 17, and that the team is preparing a Halloween event with new cosmetics for various characters on the Marvel Rivals roster.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals' fourth season has seen some major changes, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/">the addition of a PlayStation 4 version of the game</a> and the introduction of cross-platform progression. However, a bigger, and likely more controversial change is still to come, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/loot-boxes-might-be-coming-to-marvel-rivals/">rumours still loom that loot boxes will be added to the game</a>.</p>
