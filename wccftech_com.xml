After months of updates, the popular <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">FromSoftware</strong> hardcore action RPG is now <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fully playable</strong> thanks to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ShadPS4 emulator</strong>, even on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dated hardware</strong></a> and handheld systems like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-version-0-12-6-massive-performance-boost-bloodborne/">Steam Deck</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Emulation, however, still isn't perfect, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">online features</strong> are not accessible - but that may be about to change. A new video shared on YouTube by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gmoralistube">George Moralis</a></strong>, one of the emulator's lead developers, shows <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloodborne</em> running on PC with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">online features enabled</strong>.</p>

<p>As for how <em>Bloodborne's</em> online features will function in future versions of <strong>ShadPS4</strong>, it is too early to say. According to George Moralis, the development team is <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oqkDeWhV5g&amp;lc=Ugx0oiPx3VLoeDEw0VB4AaABAg.ARJJ8ekVjhrARJN3dkWPbQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examining several options</a></strong>, including <strong>dedicated community servers</strong> or <strong>local servers</strong>. One thing, however, is certain: users playing on the emulated version will <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oqkDeWhV5g&amp;lc=UgzvNpnDQCtzxPeQ-fd4AaABAg.ARJM4Pn3JqpARJMu_zF1QS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never be able to connect to Sony's official servers</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Besides perfecting <em>Bloodborne's</em> emulation, the <strong>ShadPS4 development team</strong> is continuing to expand the list of <strong>PlayStation 4 exclusives</strong> playable on PC. More information on the emulator's progress can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/"><strong>official website</strong>.</a></p>

		<ul>

		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-remaster-early-2026/">Back in October, a rumour popped up</a> claiming that Warhorse Studios was working on a remaster of the first <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong> game. There wasn't a lot to go off, since the rumour came from a lone source on Reddit, and while this source, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxp5od/kingdom_come_1_upgrade_info/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">bertik11</a>, has previously been reliable about unreleased information from Warhorse Studios, it was still worth taking the news with a huge grain of salt.</p>



<p>That's still true, of course, though bertik11 has now added to his previous claim. They now specify that the remaster will arrive in February 2026, and that while players might've been hopeful for what a remaster of a game that is now seven years old (soon to be eight) at the time of this writing will look like, we shouldn't expect too much.</p>



<p>"<em>Two months ago I wrote about the upgrade of the first Kingdom Come and new game. Today I wanna share info about upcoming upgrade for next gen consoles</em>," bertik11 began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxp5od/kingdom_come_1_upgrade_info/">in a post on the GamingLeaksandRumors Reddit</a>. "<em>From what I’ve heard, a remaster of the original Kingdom Come is supposedly coming in February. Don’t expect too much, because as far as I’ve heard, it’s just going to be a port from PC. It won’t bring anything groundbreaking or entirely new — it’ll mostly just be a port for the new consoles</em>."</p>



<p>Again, this is all still just stemming from one unknown source who has previously been right when it comes to information on Warhorse Studios. Warhorse has not officially announced that it is making a remaster of the first Kingdom Come game, nor has it acknowledged its future plans now that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">is out, and all of its DLCs are available</a>.</p>



<p>That said, it would make perfect sense for Warhorse to work on an update like this, something to bolster the first game for current-gen consoles, and to capitalize on the success its sequel has enjoyed all year. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">was one of the top-selling new games on Steam for 2025</a> and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">nominees for multiple awards, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025</a>. </p>



<p>It's also high on end-of-year lists for several publications, including Wccftech, as we have it on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">Best Games of 2025</a> list,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"> Best Role-Playing Games</a> list, and even its DLC Mysteria Ecclesiae on our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2025-expanding-the-fun/">Best DLC/Expansions</a> list. All this to say that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been one of 2025's defining titles, so it makes perfect sense for Warhorse to try and keep the series in players' minds by inviting them to return to the original.</p>



<p>Though if bertik11 is correct that the remaster will be closer to a port of the PC version to current-gen platforms instead of a deeper remaster, then how Warhorse handles it will be a huge element to how it is received. If it is just a port of the PC version, but there's no upgrade path for current owners, and they have to buy the full game all over again, or even worse, it's released as an entirely new game that everyone - PC players included - will have to buy again if they want all of the new graphical features, then that likely won't go over well with players who played and loved the game back in 2018. Nor will those who got into the series through the sequel be too enthused.</p>



<p>Of course, it's Warhorse's right to make those decisions if it likes, but it may go against capitalizing on the success of the sequel. Regardless, this whole rumor might not even be accurate, so we'll have to wait and see what happens in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“We’ll Cross the Oceans of Time to Make This” – Simu Liu’s Sleeping Dogs Movie Taps Timo Tjahjanto to Direct]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/simu-liu-sleeping-dogs-movie-taps-timo-tjahjanto-to-direct/</link>
            <guid>1394380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a decade since we started to hear about <strong>Sleeping Dogs</strong>, the award-winning action-adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/sleeping-dogs-united-front-games-closed/">from the now-defunct United Front Games</a>, getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/donnie-yen-star-movie-adaptation-sleeping-dogs/">a film adaptation</a>. While for years, it seemed like the project, like the studio that made the original game, was dead in the water, Shang-Chi star <strong>Simu Liu</strong> has made it his personal mission to revive the film. Now, Liu has achieved a crucial step in that revival journey: by signing <strong>Timo Tjahjanto</strong> to be the film's director.</p>



<p>Liu and Tjahjanto both confirmed the news on <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/2005248175159050363">X (formerly Twitter)</a> with an exchange that began with a user asking Liu for an update on how the film is progressing. Liu pointed the user to Tjahjanto, who followed up with a gif from the game and the caption "<em>We'll cross the oceans of time to make this</em>."</p>



<p>Liu then responded with, "<em>Ladies and gents, the director of Sleeping Dogs</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's still unclear who will be penning the script, but it's good to see the film adaptation getting some momentum with Liu seemingly being the driving force behind any movement the film has. Liu is working on the film as a producer and will also ultimately star in it as Wei Shen, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sleeping-dogs-movie-still-on-donnie-yen/">essentially taking over the roles that the legendary Donnie Yen had all those years ago when we first heard of the adaptation</a>.</p>



<p>For his own part, <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/2005605017731178792">Tjahjanto added</a>, "<em>I’m excited to be developing SLEEPING DOGS with</em> <em>Simu Liu. We both are hungry and passionate about the material &amp; have plenty to prove. It's no secret that both TNCFU &amp; The Shadow Strays took inspiration from Sleeping Dogs, heck, I even based a character in TSS straight outta SD down to his name. This will take time, but we’ll make the best version out of it, Cleaver, chopsticks n' all.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, the film still has a long way to go before we can look forward to seeing it in theatres, but it's clear that Liu is not giving up on it any time soon. The more he puts the pieces of it together, the closer we are to seeing the film in theatres, and then hopefully, the closer we are to getting another Sleeping Dogs game.</p>



<p>After all, that's always been Liu's plan. "<em>First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone...that's always been the dream</em>," he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) at the beginning of 2025. </p>

			<p><strong>Shawn Layden</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-worldwide-studios-chairman-shawn-layden-to-depart-the-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retired</a> from his <span>position as Chairman of&nbsp;<strong>Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios</strong>, Sony's gaming division responsible for creating PlayStation exclusives, in 2019, after spending 32 years&nbsp;</span>at the company in various roles.</p>



<p>Since then, the former executive has often commented on industry-related topics. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-discless/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the <strong>PlayStation 6</strong>, Sony's next console, is unlikely to be completely discless as the physical market is still a sizable one for the company.</p>



<p>A few days ago, Layden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwH_otOCDmQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a video interview</a> with YouTubers Naomi Kyle and Pause for Thought. During the 47-minute conversation, the executive admitted that the total install base of console users hasn't changed all that much in the past few generations, and proposed the creation of a 'consortium', like those used for the VHS, DVD, or Blu-ray, to create a <strong>unified gaming format</strong> that can then be licensed out.</p>



<p><em>We talk about gaming as being this $250 billion industry, which it is, and have hundreds of millions of users, which it does. But of course, that includes, if you're playing Wordle, you're a gamer. If you're playing Candy Crush, you're a gamer in that number. But the number of discrete consoles sold over any particular generation caps out at about 250 million. </em></p>



<p><em>If you line up all the PS1s, Sega Saturns, and N64s, and you go by generations, it's all about 250. The one time it popped to almost 300 was the generation that had the Wii, and people thought you could buy Wii Fit and lose weight. So, we got some non-traditional gaming audience to buy into the gaming industry at that time, but that was an anomaly and we've still flattened out. We need to crack that cap, that barrier. The only way we can do that is if, and I know people call me crazy and throw stones at me when I say this, but you know, Sony's Betamax format lost to VHS for one reason only: VHS licensed its format across many different manufacturers. </em></p>



<p><em>Sony held the unique Betamax patent trademark and everything. There was a license we did with Toshiba towards the end of the life cycle, but it never went wide like VHS and people didn't understand the need of having the same machine as your neighbor. You could have an RCA TV and you have a Sony TV and that's all fine. But once your neighbor has picked VHS and you want to watch that tape of that movie, but you have Betamax all of a sudden… So the industry coalesced around VHS. Then, later on, Sony and Philips created the compact disc consortium. They created the patent and then they licensed it out to all the other manufacturers. The same thing happened with DVD. The same thing happened with Blu-ray. They said that we'll compete on the device. So if you get a Bang &amp; Olufsen Blu-ray player, it's going to cost you more than the Sano version. Even though they'll both support the platform, but they'll have different bells and whistles. </em></p>



<p><em>I think we need to get in a world where we have a gaming format, and maybe it just comes from PC. Maybe we find a way just to do it all, you know, in a Linux kernel or something. And then we have a consortium around that. We have licensing programs which allow other manufacturers to build into that space and then you can talk about real numbers moving. That's how you get to the ubiquity of the toaster. But right now, I think we're kind of trapped in this containment field.</em></p>



<p>This is exactly the same problem that Microsoft has been shouting to the four winds for several years now, as it desperately reaches for the billions of potential gamers who could, in theory, be interested in games but have no intention of buying a specific console system. </p>



<p>Layden's vision also sounds pretty close to the single gaming platform ecosystem, which, personally, I've been advocating for several years. And yes, if it ever happened, it would have to be based on the PC. For Microsoft, it wouldn't be a big stretch, as they have already admitted they want to be everywhere the user is. Sony itself is also bringing its games to PC (albeit a bit late) and even to Xbox, as shown with Helldivers 2. The only major player in the console space that exclusively develops games for its own platform is Nintendo. </p>



<p>Their policy appears unlikely to change any time soon. Still, Layden's proposition is worth considering. Would you embrace such a change? Let us know below.</p>
