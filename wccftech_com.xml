			<p>The recently released Half-Life 2 RTX demo is not only a great showcase of the potential of NVIDIA RTX Remix but also of the DirectX 12 Ultimate Sampler Feedback feature, which has the potential to be quite a game-changer in terms of VRAM usage.</p>
<p>A new video shared earlier this week on YouTube by Compusemble shows Sampler Feedback streaming in action in the demo, showing how the technology can significantly reduce VRAM usage in pretty much every scenario. While the reduced VRAM usage doesn't lead to any significant performance improvement, the technology is definitely impressive and could definitely help improve image quality and performance in games running on GPUs with low VRAM capacity.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Half-Life 2 RTX is an amazing showcase of what can be achieved using NVIDIA's RTX Remix, although the quality of the transformative upgrade is impacted by the change in the atmosphere of the original game. You can learn more about the demo by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/">piece.</a></p>
<p><em>Half-Life 2 RTX boasts amazingly remade assets that show outstanding fidelity even when zoomed upon. In this regard, the team at Orbifold has done incredible work so far. And then, of course, there's the path tracing, boosted by RTXDI and Neural Radiance Cache. The game is completely transformed with them, almost entirely for the better, with bounce lights and indirect lighting illuminating everything they should and bringing the environments to life.</em></p>
<p>The Half-Life 2 RTX demo is now available for download for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam.</a></p>

			<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition has a hidden 60 FPS mode, which suggests the recent game may have been future-proofed ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>As confirmed by known modder MasaGrator, this 60 FPS mode is hidden in the game's executable but doesn't function properly, as enabling it causes some unspecified issues. While this mode could be some development leftover, it would definitely make more sense if its faulty implementation could be the basis upon which a Nintendo Switch 2 patch for the game could be built to allow the game to take advantage of the console's additional power and deliver a 60 FPS experience.</p>

- Dynamic resolution ranges: 504p-720p handheld, 760p-1080p docked<br>
- Game's executable has hidden 60 FPS mode. It seems to be implemented only partially since enabling it causes weird issues. As a proof screen from function that sets UI speed, 1.0.1 <a href="https://t.co/Ag09YVQ7g1">pic.twitter.com/Ag09YVQ7g1</a></p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is the best way to experience one of the most unique entries in the series developed by Monolith Soft, thanks to the improved UI, streamlined mechanics and new content, though the presentation could have been polished a little more. You can learn more about the game in Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition brings one of Nintendo’s best open worlds to a new audience with confidence, offering up much-improved UI, smartly-streamlined mechanics, and some intriguing new content. While the game’s presentation could perhaps use a touch more polish, the game is an out-of-this-world Switch RPG worth experiencing before Nintendo launches its next hardware.</em></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is now available on Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>
