			<p>Now that we are mere days from 2025, GTA 6 is starting to materialize as the proverbial elephant in the room, something that nobody in the gaming industry will be able to ignore one way or the other when <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it ships next Fall</a>.</p>
<p>Rockstar owner Take-Two is certainly eager to repeat the success of Grand Theft Auto 5, which became the second best-selling game of all time after Minecraft with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 200 million units sold</a>. CEO Strauss Zelnick recently spoke a bit about the next Grand Theft Auto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09uNAeQNdg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a video interview with Conner Mather</a>, hyping it up with a single sentence:</p>
<p><em>I would say I think it'll be extraordinary and worth waiting for.</em></p>
<p>Later in the chat, Zelnick spoke in more general terms about the GTA community's feedback, and he seemed to hint that Rockstar has prepared features and content the fans might not even have dreamed of for GTA 6.</p>
<p><em>We definitely listen to feedback from our fans, absolutely. You need to, in our business, and you're able to. But remember, the biggest hits are always the ones that are unexpected. Everything that we do has to be new and different, not derivative. So, by definition when people are commenting on something that is in the market, that means they're looking at something that was done before. Our teams are focused on what's new that you haven't even thought about, like, you thought you were anticipating this thing, but this is way bigger and way better and more exciting and more beautiful than you could have possibly thought of.</em></p>
<p>Looking back at GTA 5 and GTA Online (which just got <a href="https://wccftech.com/festive-events-make-a-return-to-gta-online-through-january-1-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update for the Holidays</a>), Zelnick revealed that Take-Two never thought the game would sell this much or that the Online mode would get more popular. In fact, it wasn't even going to have a virtual currency in the original plans.</p>
<p><em>I don't think any of us did. I think that we saw it as a really interesting add-on to the title. We actually originally had not planned to have virtual currency in the game, so it wasn't going to be an economic driver. It was relatively late in the day when we decided to pursue virtual currency because it was so long ago - we're looking back to 2013. And it wasn't an immediate success. You may recall it was pretty buggy at first. We had some trouble coming out of the gate because it was all new, and we were innovating; we were doing it all in real-time.&nbsp;It was like building a plane while you're taking off and then flying. It is an incredible, durable success and it continues to to perform many, many years later. It's astonishing and no, I don't think any of us expected that, but we also didn't expect to sell 205 million units. We never expected that. That was way outside of the realm of anything we contemplated.</em></p>

			<p>2024 saw the release of some absolutely fantastic indie games spanning a variety of genres. Indie games are where unique ideas flourish and bring something new and exciting to the table. This year saw some amazing indie games that even went on to win awards across a multitude of categories, speaking plainly for their excellence.</p>
<p>Here are all of the titles we've picked for Wccftech's best indie games of 2024. Truly, we were spoiled for choice. As usual, make sure to check out the other lists as they are released on the website to see what games came out on top this year.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a></em></p>

<h2>UFO 50</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ufo-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFO 50</a> is the third title to be made by Mossmouth, the creator of Spelunky. This game was released in September of this year and even received a 91 on Metacritic, with a User Score of 7.7. When it comes to scores, this is pretty darn fantastic. For those who haven't yet played the game, UFO 50 is a collection of fun and vibrant games that can be played single-player or multiplayer. They span a variety of genres, from shoot-em-ups, puzzlers and platformers. The goal with this game was to replicate the nostalgic feeling of an 8-bit aesthetic, and they did just that.</p>

<h2>Animal Well (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-well-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.6/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Animal Well was a surprising release this year, but a widely successful one at that. This title was made by a single developer and was published by Bigmode, a YouTuber videogamedunkey's publishing company, with his wife, Leah. This wacky game went on to perform incredibly well, with vibrant and surreal aesthetics as you explore an interconnected labyrinth, collect items and platforms, and do your best to survive. Below is an excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's review.</p>
<p><em>For such a tiny pixelated world, Animal Well is overflowing with secrets. Merely acquiring a new upgrade tool opens the floodgates of possibilities for exploration. As players explore the depths of the well, one of the recurring collectibles to discover comes by way of eggs, of which there are 64 in total to collect. Collecting certain thresholds of eggs rewards the player with various new tools, including the ability to leave hint stamps or draw lines on the in-game map. If it weren’t for these tools, I probably would have been at a loss for some of these eggs where I could see something clearly amiss in the room that I didn’t have the correct tool for at the time.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2>Balatro</h2>
<p>Balatro has taken the world by storm. Even for people who have never played a game of poker in their lives, this has become a favorite for many people across the globe. It's widely accessible on every platform and serves as a great time sink. This game has been so successful that it even went on to win multiple awards at The Game Awards this year, with a nomination for Game of the Year, which is a huge achievement for an indie game.</p>
<p>Balatro was released in February this year, and it doesn't seem that there is any sign of it slowing down any time soon. People continue to play it, and the developer continues to add fun aesthetic updates to the game, with plans for other add-ons in the future. Looking at <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Metacritic scores</a>, Balatro received a score of 90, with a User Score of 8.2.</p>

<h2>Hades II</h2>
<p>Hades was a huge success when it was released, and saw a lot of people fall in love with Greek Mythology via a video game. Hades II is no different. This highly anticipated sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on Early Access in May and has been widely successful since its release. The game has already seen a ton of updates and content added to the game to help flesh it out, and it's well on its way to being a fully-fledged product. Instead of playing as Zagreus in this title, players get to experience the life and story of Melinoe, Zag's sister. It features a cast of different Gods and Goddesses to interact with, different weaponry, and much more.</p>
<p>Hades II was also on our highly anticipated indie games of 2024 list released last year, and it certainly hasn't disappointed thus far.</p>

<h2>Thank Goodness You're Here!</h2>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here is such a peculiar game and is perfect for those who are looking for a comedic experience in their game. Released in August this year, Thank Goodness You're Here is a comedic slapformer, set in Northern England. The game is fully voiced, and features some iconic voice actors in the game to help set the tone.</p>
<p>This title received a 90 on Metacritic from critic reviews and a 7.6 User Score. While the game may not be for everyone, it's a pretty surreal experience and provides some great laughs when you need them.</p>
