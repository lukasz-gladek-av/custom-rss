			<p>Arguably, the biggest surprise at The Game Awards 2025 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-a-single-player-rpg-spiritual-successor-to-knights-of-the-old-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the announcement of Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>. Leaker Kurakasis had mentioned that there would be a Star Wars game whose title ended with 'Old Republic', but everyone thought it would be a new look at the Knights of the Old Republic remake.</p>



<p>Instead, viewers were treated to the unveiling of a brand new project, spearheaded by Casey Hudson, the Game Director and Producer of the original KOTOR (as well as Game Director of the Mass Effect trilogy). Hudson founded a new developer called Arcanaut Studios, headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, with additional offices in Kelowna, British Columbia.</p>



<p>The fact is, the studio's foundation was relatively recent, having been officially dated to July 2025. This makes sense, given that Hudson had previously been busy with another studio, Humanoid Origin, which he <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-trilogy-directors-aaa-sci-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded years ago</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to shut down in late 2024 due to a lack of funding</a>.</p>



<p>This realization chilled a bit of the excitement surrounding Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic as players realized it would take a long time before they could play it. It didn't help that other <span>major Star Wars game projects, such as the KOTOR remake and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-announced-by-quantic-dream-and-lucasfilm-games/" target="_blank">Quantic Dream's Star</a></span> Wars: Eclipse, suffered a similar fate: being announced way too early. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier compounded those fears in a message <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on the social network Bluesky</a>:</p>



<p><em>Last night's biggest surprise was Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, led by Casey Hudson, who directed KOTOR (and Anthem). Exciting news for lots of people… but Lucasfilm says the studio was founded this year, which means that 2030 is an optimistic guess. Maybe it'll be a PlayStation 7 game.</em></p>



<p>Schreier's guess was indeed solid on the surface, since the average development timeframe for a triple-A game is five years at the least. However, Casey Hudson himself later <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimed in on the release window</a>, telling fans to discard the 2030 rumors as the game would launch before that year.</p>



<p>Given the source, we have to trust that there is indeed a plan to get the game out in four years at the most. Is that even possible, though? Sure, depending on a couple of factors. The first is the game's scope. While the details are scant at this point (other than the project's status as a spiritual successor to KOTOR rather than a direct sequel), Arcanaut and Lucasfilm explicitly said this will be a 'narrative-driven' action RPG. </p>



<p>In current developer lingo, this definition usually suggests a tight, story-focused experience that won't feature expansive open worlds with plenty of side content and activities. In short, don't expect to be roaming vast regions of Tattooine or Coruscant or Hoth or what have you as you solve problems for fairly inconsequential citizens of the galaxy. Instead, as Hudson noted <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his interview with the official Star Wars website</a>, the developers will focus on delivering a 'powerful, cinematic adventure driven by player agency, narrative depth, and immersive world-building'.</p>



<p>This isn't so different from the original Knights of the Old Republic game, which was relatively linear and only included around seven and a half hours of side content, according to the average playthroughs listed <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/9111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by HowLongToBeat.com</a>. With this in mind, it would not be impossible to see Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic launch at some point in 2029. Another potential accelerator could be the use of AI during development, which might certainly cut down development times if used effectively. However, it may not be well-received by some fans.</p>



<p>Even so, we have at least a few years to wait before we can play this title. Thankfully, a recent report <a href="https://wccftech.com/kotor-remake-developer-revealed-full-kotor-ii-remake-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the KOTOR remake is still alive and being worked on at Mad Head Games. Fingers crossed, but it should certainly launch before 2029, if all goes well. The same goes for Eclipse.</p>



<p>To round up the slate of upcoming games set in the faraway galaxy created by George Lucas, Respawn is <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making the third and final entry in the Star Wars: Jedi series</a>. The second game launched in April 2023, so we might be looking at late 2027 or early 2028 for the next installment.</p>



<p>Star Wars fans will have two new games to play next year, anyway: the newly announced arcade racing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galactic Racer</a> and the turn-based tactics game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-clone-wars-and-due-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Company</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> have come and gone and Half-Life 3 was still nowhere to be seen, despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors of an imminent official announcement</a>. That was more than enough to send some of the fans who had truly believed into utter despair, but all is not lost.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/x7GRLcaZtgA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest episode of the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a>, journalist Mike Straw provided an update on the Half-Life 3 situation. According to his sources, Valve is holding back the announcement due to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/within-three-months-samsung-ddr5-5600-16-gb-module-price-rose-by-3x-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing RAM pricing issues</a> affecting the PC industry, which will inevitably impact the price of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Since the game is supposed to be the big launch title of the new hardware, it doesn't make sense to reveal it until they are ready to go forward with the Steam Machine. The original launch window was <strong>Spring 2026</strong> for both. </p>



<p><em>I wanted to just give an update on things. People have asked. I have been told a date. I wasn't going to report that date because they weren't 100% confident in that date. That date has sailed past. So, there's a reason I didn't report it. Every date from every journalist I've spoken with, every creator who follows it and has dug, every single date that they were told has passed. [...] Now, everything I have, everybody I talked to, is still adamant that Half-Life 3 will be a launch title for the Steam Machine. </em></p>



<p><em>There is a concern, however, that they haven't made a decision on price, which is holding back the announcement of anything else. The reason is because of PC RAM prices. They're up 200%, 300%, 500% of what they were in October, and it's only getting worse. The window that I was told was Spring 2026, for the Steam Machine, for the Steam Frame, for the Steam Controller, for Half-Life 3. [...] At the end of the day, the game is real. There's no denying it. It's just a when and not if at this point. All the signs pointed to it being announced in December. Then everything hit the fan, and I think it was a case of that concern. The Steam Machine was supposed to be Q1, like the end of Q1 2026, but I'm starting to wonder if that hardware's going to be pushed out. </em></p>



<p><em>I can tell you the people I spoke to about this game, they're not these run-of-the-mill sources that haven't gotten me information before. They're the same sources that have given me details on Madden. A couple of them are the same sources that have given me details on <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-in-development-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings game that is in development that I reported on</a>. They're not random, like, one-off people, and they're still adamant that Half-Life 3 is coming in the Spring.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the pricing of the Steam Machine has already been a somewhat controversial topic, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following Valve's confirmation that it won't be subsidized like consoles</a>. That is to say, Valve isn't willing to lose money on unit sales to recoup with game sales via Steam and accessory sales, as Microsoft and Sony have done in the past with Xbox and PlayStation consoles. With the aforementioned RAM pricing issue, Valve may be forced to put a hefty price tag on the hardware, potentially hampering its sales from the start. It makes sense that they would rather wait and even delay its launch a bit if necessary.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, if you'd like to get a sense of how Half-Life 3 might play once it is finally released, <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our dedicated article</a>, which includes all datamined information from Source 2 engine updates and more. </p>
