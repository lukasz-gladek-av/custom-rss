			<p>The biggest announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025</a> is definitely Darksiders 4. After Chronos: Before the Ashes and the two Remnant games, Gunfire Games returns to its historical franchise (the studio was founded by David Adams after the closure of Vigil Games, which developed the first two Darksiders titles). </p>



<p>The previous chapter was released in 2018 to relatively mixed reviews. However, 2019's spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/darksiders-genesis-top-down-or-third-person-hell-is-still-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darksiders Genesis</a> (developed by Airship Syndicate) fared better and also introduced the final horseman of the apocalypse, Strife (the previous games allowed players to control the others: War, Death, and Fury).</p>



<p>Admittedly, Gunfire and THQ Nordic had teased a new Darkiders title during last year's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase. However, now we have a teaser trailer, and it shows us that the Four Horsemen will all work together for the first time in the franchise. As confirmed by the Steam page, this indeed means that online co-op will be available for the first time in Darksiders.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Your Horseman<br></strong>Take up one of the legendary Horsemenâ€”each with their own unique weapons and combat styles</li>



<li><strong>Cinematic Combat<br></strong>Experience fast-paced, visceral action blending melee, fluid traversal, and supernatural abilities.</li>



<li><strong>Expansive Realms to Explore<br></strong>Journey through apocalyptic landscapes - each teeming with secrets, enemies, and mythic bosses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not much else is known at this point, but it's certainly enough to get fans salivating about the series' culmination. Are you eager to end the Eternal War between the forces of Heaven and Hell? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
