			<p>A new Black Myth: Wukong patch was deployed today on PC and PlayStation 5, introducing a highly requested feature, new content, PC-specific fixes, improved ray tracing performance, and more.</p>
<p>Patch 1.0.12.16581, which started rolling out on the Epic Games Store version and will gradually become available on other versions of the game, introduces a highly requested in-game map feature, the Journeyer's Chart. The first map will be unlocked when the Destined One first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper, while the others can be purchased at the Keeper's Shrine every time a new region is reached.</p>
<p>The new Black Myth: Wukong also introduces new Challenges called Return of the Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends. In the first one, which features three different difficulty settings, the Destined One will be able to challenge defeated opponents again; in the second, the Destined One will fight against opponents in quick succession using customized curses to tailor the difficulty and completing each gauntlet will reward players with new rare treasures. The patch also introduces a new armor set, the Armor Set of Opulence, to celebrate an early Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Together with a variety of gameplay fixes, the new Black Myth: Wukong also brings some PC-specific fixes that should improve the experience considerably, such as crashing fixes for NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, flickering fixes when using Intel XeSS, a memory leak fix, and more. The new patch also optimizes performance for numerous scenes and boss fights on medium and low-end configurations and enhances the performance of Full Ray Tracing on NVIDIA RTX GPUs. You can head over <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">here</a> to check out the full patch notes.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Today, GFA Games has finally provided a meaty update on their upcoming open world massively multiplayer first person shooter game PIONER. As you might recall, we interviewed the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-new-details-on-the-upcoming-stalker-inspired-mmofps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2021</a> and then a second time <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2023</a>, when the game was supposed to launch a beta testing phase. That never happened, but now GFA Games has confirmed that PIONER will launch next year on Steam<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, where the game is available for wishlisting.</p>
<p>There's a new trailer, too, along with an updated overview of the game's features, mechanics, and content. As previously reported, PIONER is set in an alternate reality inspired by the Soviet era and filled with atmospheric landscapes and unique architecture. The narrative is reportedly influenced by classic science fiction (specifically, we might add, GSC Game World's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER franchise</a>), featuring deep characters, powerful artifacts, and mysterious anomalies shaping the story. It will unfold over the course of a story-driven campaign through several quests that will delve into the setting's lore. Players will be able to align with charismatic factions, each offering distinct characters, viewpoints, and special rewards.</p>
<p>In PIONER, players will increase their influence by completing missions, defeating monsters, and exploring the world. More significant influence makes merchants more inclined to sell you better items, allow higher quality materials to drop, and even allow you to improve your non-combat abilities.</p>
<p>There will be various activities for the players to engage with, such as PvE missions, PvP arenas, events, and even mini-games like fishing and casino games. Moreover, the game includes an extraction shooter experience within the so-called Shadowlands. These are high-reward zones open to unrestricted PvP, where players can attack others freely, except for faction or clan members. The upside is that you'll find plenty of great loot here.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Wish" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hq3Y2uxXHGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>PIONER offers the opportunity to create clans. Members may communicate through chat and/or emotes, as well as competing on clan leaderboards. On the PvE side, there will be six raids at launch that reportedly mix open world and structured missions, providing a challenge that requires teamwork to overcome.</p>
<p>At its core, the game has some survival elements, too. Players must take care to keep hunger and fatigue at bay. There's also a crafting system where players use artifacts, anomalous energy, and scavenged materials to create new equipment. Lastly, there's extensive weapon customization with lots of unique designs and modules.</p>
<p>PIONER remains firmly on our radar. There aren't many upcoming MMOFPS games, and this one definitely looks worth checking out.</p>
