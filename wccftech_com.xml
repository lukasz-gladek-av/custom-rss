			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-no-playstation-network-account-pc/">Bungie's</a> first new game in over a decade finally got its full reveal today. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/">Marathon</a>, a new extraction shooter that is actually a reboot of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398450/Classic_Marathon/">very first game</a> Bungie released by the same name, had a big showcase featuring our first honest look at gameplay for the new shooter, and we also got the announcement for the release date.</p>
<p>Marathon will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on<strong> September 23, 2025</strong>, but if you're especially keen to try it out for yourself, you can sign up for a closed alpha test later this month by joining the game's <a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame">official Discord server.</a></p>
<p>The livestream showcase for Marathon included a panel of the game's lead developers, including game director Joe Zeigler, art director Joseph Cross, gameplay director Andrew Witts, and senior design lead Lars Bakken. Each talked about their experiences with Marathon, talking the game up between the short gameplay trailers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Trailers that do show off some Marathon gameplay, but none of them are as effective in showing what the game actually looks like in motion than a 20 minute video that shows highlights from Bungie inviting content creators and press to play the game. In that video you're watching a select few creator's direct gameplay feed, and we get a much better sense of what Marathon looks like when you're on stick.</p>
<p>We also got a bit more information on some of the core details of Marathon, like the four Runners that players can choose from: Void, Glitch, Blackbird, and Locus. Each runner comes with their own set of abilities that inform the playstyle you can go for with them, but you're not limited to what kinds of weapons and load-outs you can craft, so you're free to play how you like.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Creator Alpha Gameplay Highlights" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BlC31D_Rr-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The livestream showcase ended with a bit more information on Marathon's narrative, which will be told over seasonal updates as Marathon is a multiplayer-only game, with no dedicated single-player mode. That said, we also got confirmation that you can solo-queue in Marathon if you don't have two other people to play with to make a full squad of three or don't want to play with randoms.</p>
<p>Overall, Marathon doesn't look like it's doing much to distinguish itself from the already overcrowded genre of modern-day first-person shooters. Bungie's signature brand of first-person shooting and the game's art style certainly have a chance at making yet another extraction shooter feel fresh, but we'll have to wait until we actually get to play it to see if it has a chance at surviving. And that's without even mentioning the other elephant in the room, which is the fact that we still don't know what the final price of the game will be.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is about to become an even better-looking game with the NaturalVision Enhanced mod, which promises to bring the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>The new version of the popular mood now available for the original version of the game has been showcased this week with some brand new screenshots that highlight the stunning visual improvements it will bring. In addition to the brand new improvements, the developer behind the mod, Razed, confirmed on <a href="https://discord.gg/gtav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> that they have been able to enable an unused feature in Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition which casts additional shadows from all light resources, resulting in more depth and detail in the vast majority of scenarios, as highlighted in some <a href="https://content.razedmods.com/enhanced">comparison screenshots</a>. A release date for the mod, which will be launched for free, has yet to be confirmed, but a trailer is already in the works, so it shouldn't be long until we see more of this mod in actual action.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is, without a doubt, the best way to experience the fifth entry in the series ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI release later this year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. In addition to providing a great experience that looks better than ever, the new version of the game is likely also a<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/"> preview of some of the tech</a> players should expect to see in the upcoming new entry in the series, although it will be only until the PC version until the game's gorgeous visuals will run at anything beyond 30 FPS if how the Enhanced Edition runs on CPUs on par with those powering current generation consoles is of any indication.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about this version of the game in Alessio's<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/"> analysis.</a></p>
