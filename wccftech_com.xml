			<p>A new entry in the Fire Emblem series may be in the works for Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a recent online discovery.</p>



<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAPgmb2p7L8">Doctre81</a>, a veteran Japanese 3D character modeler who has worked with Square Enix, SEGA, and Cygames, among other publishers, revealed on LinkedIn that they have worked from January 2025 until April 2025 on the "sequel of Nintendo's SRPG (tactical role-playing game) on Switch 2". While the 3D character modeler hasn't mentioned the name of the game, or the series it belongs to, there's a very good chance this sequel is a new entry in the Fire Emblem series, as the other notable tactical role-playing series by the Japanese company, Advance Wars, hasn't seen a new entry in a very long time, and it may not be as popular nowadays as to warrant a sequel, considering how Advance Wars 1+2: Re‑Boot Camp did not set the sales charts on fire. The fact that the 3D character modeler only worked for a few months in the game may also suggest this isn't a new entry in the series, but possibly a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for one of the Fire Emblem games released on the original Switch.</p>

<p>It has been some time since we saw a new entry in the Fire Emblem series, so a new game launching on Nintendo Switch 2 would make many fans quite happy, especially those who didn't exactly like the latest entry in the franchise, Fire Emblem Engage. The game launched in 2023 features very solid gameplay, bringing back some classic mechanics, but its mixed bag of character designs, disappointing storyline, and trite social elements left something to be desired.

			<p>A second Starfield DLC expansion continues to be in the works, but it may not launch this year, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>A few days back, well-known insider Nate the Hate revealed on the ResetERA forums that Bethesda isn't quite done with its latest role-playing game, as another DLC is in the works, but it doesn't seem like it will release in 2025 at this point. While this may be disappointing for those who are eagerly awaiting a reason to return to Starfield, if the expansion is taking longer to develop than the Shattered Space expansion, which launched only one year after the base game, it could mean that it will be way more substantial than the first expansion.</p>



<p>The Starfield Shattered Space limited scope was hardly the only issue of the expansion. While the introduction of a more focused storyline was very welcome, the expansion left a lot to be desired, as the average map and quest design and the lack of new features turn it into a slog fast, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review</a>. Hopefully, the new expansion, which is rumored to be titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>, will introduce the new features and tweaks Starfield needs to become a much better game.</p>



<p>Starfield and the Shattered Space expansions are now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. A PlayStation 5 port of the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">rumored</a> to be in the works, and despite earlier indications suggesting its announcement would be imminent, has yet to be officially revealed.</p>

			<p>British developer The Chinese Room has gained independence back from Sumo Digital, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports IGN</a>. As you might recall, Sumo Digital <a href="https://wccftech.com/sumo-digital-acquired-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought</a> the development studio nearly seven years ago, in August 2018, for an undisclosed sum.</p>



<p>Now, though, The Chinese Room has sought independence because Sumo Digital had recently switched to a development-for-hire model. Moreover, the studio feared Sumo would sell it to some other company. The team will be headed by current studio director Ed Daly, who received funding help from venture capital firm Hiro Capital. Here's a statement from Daly:</p>



<p><em>This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision. This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein.</em></p>



<p>Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital, added: </p>



<p><em>The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage. From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they've been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British. We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations. That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports.</em></p>



<p>The Chinese Room, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/paradox-confirms-layoffs-at-the-chinese-room-claims-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-development-is-unaffected-by-the-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off some employees</a>, is working on two unannounced IPs. However, by far its most anticipated game is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took over from Hardsuit Labs on behalf of publisher Paradox Interactive</a>. Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now set to launch in October 2025</a>, and we expect to learn a lot more about it next month at Gamescom.</p>
