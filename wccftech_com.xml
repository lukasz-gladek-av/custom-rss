			<p>Ghost of Yotei has been rated in Taiwan today, suggesting that, judging from some precedents, the game may not be too far from release.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu, the second entry in the series developed by Sucker Punch received an R rating for violence, tobacco and alcohol and inappropriate language, which was predictable looking at the first entry in the series. While the rating also highlights how a launch date has not been revealed yet, we are likely going to hear more about it very soon, as not much time usually passes from the first ratings in Asian countries to the release date announcements. For Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, another big PlayStation 5 exclusive launching in 2025, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-june-26-pre-orders-begin-soon/">launch date</a> was confirmed a little over a month after the game was rated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">South Korea.</a></p>

<p>We haven't seen much of Ghost of Yotei since its announcement last year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gets-new-details-from-official-website/">Back in March</a>, the game's official website confirmed some details regarding the new protagonist, Atsu, and some new gameplay mechanics, including new weapons like the odachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas, more varied environments that players will be able to take advantage of, and more.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is scheduled to release in 2025 on PlayStation 5. A PC version has yet to be officially announced, though there's little doubt that a port will be coming at some point.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oblivion Remastered Seems to Be Rather Well-Suited to Mods, and One of Them Adds Ray Reconstruction]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Shortly following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and release</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, the legion of Elder Scrolls modders jumped on it to see what could be done. There seems to be good news: since the game logic still runs on the original Gamebryo engine, several of the mods made for the original game are being ported and appear to be working. The usual Bethesda plugin structure based on .esp files is also intact, so users can simply add new mods (.esps) to the data folder and then make sure to also add the .esp name to the plugins.txt file.</p>
<p>In the span of mere hours, there are already around ninety mods on Nexus. Some of these are simple, run-of-the-mill skip-the-intro mods, but others are far more interesting. For example, modder sammilucia has already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> a version of their Ultra + mod, which was previously released for many PC games (Hogwarts Legacy, RoboCop: Rogue City, Silent Hill 2 Remake, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, Ghostrunner 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Avowed, Runescape: Dragonwilds, Black Myth: Wukong). Interestingly, this mod adds NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction to Oblivion Remastered, which is not supported by default (DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation are natively available, though). The game offers hardware-accelerated ray traced Lumen global illumination, and Ray Reconstruction can boost its quality. Ultra + also makes other tweaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved fog quality</li>
<li>Fix fog ghosting</li>
<li>Fix fog artifacting against the sky</li>
<li>Include fog in Lumen tracing for GI and reflections</li>
<li>Increase lighting quality in general via modifying the game's PostProcessVolumes</li>
<li>Add several lighting quality levels, allowing maximum theoretical lighting quality</li>
<li>Improved reflection quality</li>
<li>Fix screenspace reflection issue when Hardware Lumen is enabled</li>
<li>Performance tuning</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are already many more mods on Nexus. Some attempt to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restore the original game's colors through ReShade presets</a>. Others ensure that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quest rewards are unleveled</a> so that they are always received by the player at their maximum quality.</p>
<p>There are also tweaks to game mechanics, such as equipment degradation, which can either be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> or significantly <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slowed down</a>; carry weight can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosted to infinity</a>; spell restrictions to spellcrafting or enchanting can be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a>; the HUD can be made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sleeker and less intrusive</a>. But, as mentioned earlier, arguably the most promising aspect is that Oblivion Remastered appears to be compatible with some original mods, such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/87" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPCs Catch Fire</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horse Whistle - Summon and Follow</a>. It remains to be seen if the same will hold true for more complex mods, but if that were to be true, the game's modding potential could be enormous. We'll keep a close eye on the modding scene's development, that's for sure.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> has more than 100 notes across all 14 chapters, and it's worth your time to find them all to get the additional story context they provide.</p>
<p>The storytelling in South of Midnight is one of the game's strongest aspects, the notes included. This guide will show you where to find all the notes in Chapter 11.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Chapter 11 is one of the lighter chapters, with only eight notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>An Anguished Cry</strong> - Early on in the chapter as you follow the path, you'll jump to a dock with exploding mushrooms covering the front end of it. Jump over the mushrooms and look to your left to find this note in the form of blue art on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Stowaway's Tin Box</strong> - You can find this note in a room on the second floor of the wrecked ship, after dealing with the Stigma knot with Crouton. Walk into the room where the Stigma knot was, and turn right to find a Floof knot and this note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bill of Fare - </strong>This note can be found on the third floor of the ship, on a table on the left side of the room, where you enter, as Hazel says she remembers the story of the boat disappearing.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Old Pain, New Life</strong> - After viewing the second memory for Ayotunde, you'll find this note as another blue painting on the tree on the left side of the combat arena.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bittersweet Reunion</strong> - After seeing the third memory of Ayotunde's past, this note will appear as blue art on rocks on the left side of the main path as you move to continue the rest of the level.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>False Knowledge</strong> - After avoiding the mud thrown by Altamaha-ha, and Honey helping you back onto the boat, you'll re-enter the boat by blowing through some pieces of wood blocking the path. This note will be on the left side of the room you enter, in the form of blue paint on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Captain's Log</strong> - You'll find this note on the right side of the room you enter after using the elevator, on a desk to the right of the boat's wheel, with a Floof knot in front of the wheel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Final Message</strong> - This last note can be found after the cutscene where Honey and Altamaha-ha meet, once again as a blue painting. It'll be on a large tree on the left side of the main path.</p>
<p>That's where to find all eight notes in Chapter 11. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 82 out of 103 notes. The search is almost over, with only 21 notes left to find.</p>
