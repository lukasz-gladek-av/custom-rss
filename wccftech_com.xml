			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn features a lot of powerful Orphan enemies to defeat, but for the vast majority of them, accurate headshots with any weapon are more than enough to take them down with relative ease. This is not the case for the most powerful Orphans and those who manage to consume multiple bodies, which are easily recognizable by a peculiar trait: <strong>most of their body is covered in tentacles</strong>, making them look as if they are wearing a suit of armor. Besides making them look markedly different from any other Orphan, <strong>this sort of armor made of tentacles makes them more difficult to take down</strong>. If you try shooting at any part covered in tentacles, you will notice that your shots will <strong>bounce off.</strong> As such, you will have either have to <strong>deal with the tentacle armor first, or completely change your combat approach.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Shooting canisters to set enemies on fire and weaken them is one of the core gameplay mechanics in Cronos: The New Dawn.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Lowering the extreme defenses these Cronos: The New Dawn enemies have is not too difficult, if you have the right resources or if you are in the right place, as <strong>setting them on fire will leave them defenseless for a short while</strong>. To do so, you will either have to use the flamethrower, a Pyre bomb, or shoot canisters and the like if any are nearby. If you are in a bind, this is also the easiest way to deal with these armored enemies, as you won't need to do any accurate shooting to damage them once you set them on fire.</p>



<p>If you have no means to set these armored Orphans on fire, you can still take them down with a bit of effort. Although the tentacle armor seems impenetrable,<strong> it always leaves some parts of their bodies exposed</strong>, usually one of their arms, so if you focus your shots on these parts, you can take them down without setting them on fire. As these enemies have a lot of health, you'd better use a weapon with high firepower like any shotgun, otherwise you risk prolonging the fight too much and wasting precious ammo for the handgun, which you should save for weaker enemies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft and Sony performed a rather unusual (especially on Sony's side) shooter game exclusive exchange on August 26, when Helldivers 2 launched on Xbox Series S and X and Gears of War Reloaded brought the series to PlayStation 5 for the first time. Whereas the latter game is certainly not the only Xbox title available on Sony's console following the policy switch to full-on multiplatform, Helldivers 2 is a unicum that is unlikely to be repeated any time soon. There was a lot of demand for it, though, what with the Xbox crowd always having been shooter-friendly, and the fact that a live service always benefits from being on as many platforms as possible.</p>



<p>Now that it's been a little over a week since these launches, game analyst (and Wccftech friend) Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> an overview of how each release has performed so far. Unsurprisingly, Helldivers 2 turned out to be a lot more popular on Xbox than Gears of War Reloaded on PlayStation 5. According to the data gathered by the analytics firm, the remaster of the first title in the Gears of War series only sold around 259K units on PS5, whereas Arrowhead's hectic sci-fi cooperative game about squashing alien bugs is already nearing the million with 926K units. Helldivers 2 even outsold itself on PlayStation 5: back when it launched on Sony's console, the game sold around 633K units in the first six days. </p>



<p>As for Gears of War Reloaded, we know the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has surpassed one million players</a>. Alinea Analytics says it has reached 1.3 million at this point, but a million of those were from Xbox, despite those users knowing the game all too well. Most of those players likely accessed it from Game Pass, too. The PC userbase is really minuscule: around 41K players, per this data.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gears of War Reloaded also performed poorly compared to Forza Horizon 5, which sold nearly six times as many copies on PS5 in the same timeframe. Granted, perhaps it is not entirely fair to compare a remaster of a 19-year-old game to two much more recent games that are still among the hottest titles of the respective genres. </p>



<p>Alinea Analytics also shared more highlights from August 2025's hottest games. Peak remained the most downloaded with 4 million downloads, but Delta Force was close behind it with 3.7 million downloads, owing to the recent console launch and a resurgence on Steam as well. Grounded 2 secured the third place with 2.2 million downloads. </p>



<p>When it comes to premium games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> has sold over 1.2 million units at this point, half of which on PlayStation 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is at 500K units, though it's still early days given that it debuted exactly a week ago.</p>
