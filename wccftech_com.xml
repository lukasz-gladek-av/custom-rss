			<p>There is little doubt that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Monolith Productions</a> by Warner Bros. was one of the worst news of the year in the gaming industry, so it's great to learn that Wizards of the Coast has hired a small team of former developers led by Michael de Plater.</p>



<p>Truth be told, de Plater and his colleagues had been working more recently at Cliffhanger Games on the Black Panther game that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a few months ago by Electronic Arts</a>. Prior to that, though, they had been at Monolith Productions for a long time. de Plater himself worked on both 2014's Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and the sequel, 2017's Middle-earth: Shadow of War. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/part-of-the-team-behind-eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-joins-wizards-of-the-coast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Wizards of the Coast president John Hight said:</p>



<p><em>We're super excited to have him as part of the team. We were actually able to bring him and 14 key people that he's worked with there – and many of them at Monolith – to incubate a new game for us. He'll be starting concept development on something very cool and new – and that part I can't tell you yet. We want to give him time. We'll go through a fairly lengthy concept process where they're going to look at a lot of different ideas.</em></p>



<p>It sounds like it will take quite a lot of time before the public gets any info on the new project, but at least we know it's coming. Hight also said it's going to be a fairly similar process to that seen with Stig Asmussen's Giant Skull, although that team hit the ground running and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already making a D&amp;D  action/adventure game</a>.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast has <span>been investing heavily in video games lately. About a year ago, then-president Chris Cocks (now CEO at parent company Hasbro)&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-goes-all-in-on-videogames-wants-to-ship-1-2-games-per-year-starting-late-2025-early-2026/" target="_blank">revealed</a>&nbsp;a plan to ship one or two video games each year, starting in&nbsp;</span>late 2025 or early 2026.</p>



<p>Its announced projects, be them internal or external, include <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/">a new D&amp;D game from Invoke Studios</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op D&amp;D game from Starbreeze</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>, the digital tabletop adventure <a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEMEO x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: BATTLEMARKED</a>, the aforementioned D&amp;D action/adventure game by Giant Skull, the sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus</a> in development at Archetype Entertainment, and a GI Joe game in the making at Atomic Arcade. Another project made at Skeleton Key was reportedly canceled earlier this year.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, renowned developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed it was forced to perform a round of layoffs. However, the new Tomb Raider game project is unaffected.</p>



<p>Here's the whole message that was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Today, we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.</em></p>



<p><em>To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.</em> <em>To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision.</em></p>



<p>The studio had been collaborating with The Initiative on the Perfect Dark remake that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> last month, so this could still be related to that decision taken by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics, a studio headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been in the industry for over 33 years and is known primarily for Legacy of Kain, Gex, and of course, Tomb Raider. More recently, it released Marvel's Avengers, which largely failed to gain any traction despite the IP.</p>



<p>In April 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the studio was working on a new installment in Lara Croft's franchise, powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Crystal Dynamics' proprietary Foundation Engine. A few months later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Amazon Games would publish the new title. Amazon later acquired the movie and series rights, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">vague goals to create an interconnected universe</a> that would also include the new games. We now know that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been brought on to write and produce the series that will eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air on Prime Video</a>.</p>



<p>As for the new Tomb Raider game, we last <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-shown-in-the-not-too-distant-future-says-amazon-games-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> something official from Amazon Games head Christoph Hartmann, who said it wouldn't be too long before the project was shown to the public. That was in June 2024, though. Hopefully, we will get at least a trailer at the upcoming The Game Awards in December.</p>
