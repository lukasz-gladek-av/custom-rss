			<p>Yellow paint to indicate the way to players is among the controversial features of modern video games, but no matter how heated the debate gets, some developers, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, feel there's definitely a need for it.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/">GamesRadar+</a>, Hamaguchi-san acknowledged the debate among players while also saying that there's definitely a need for yellow paint in games in many ways. The difference, however, is in how it is implemented.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed," </em>Hamaguchi-san explained. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'no, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</em></p>



<p>As there are all sorts of players, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director's stance on the yellow paint discussion is entirely understandable, as it aims to make complex games with sprawling worlds more accessible to all. </p>



<p>Still, having the option to turn these indicators in some way would be welcome. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/92">While PC users can sometimes resort to mods</a>, offering similar toggles on consoles would likely satisfy the concerns of the community. <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">As the third and final entry in the Remake trilogy is expected to be even larger</a>, it will be interesting to see how Hamaguchi and his team manage the balance between guidance and player freedom.</p>

			<p>Last year's Silent Hill 2 remake is finally coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, as this new version of the game has been rated by the ESRB ahead of its official announcement.</p>



<p>As the yet-to-be officially announced new version of the survival horror game developed by Bloober Team, which returned the series to the spotlight after years of absence, will be identical to the PC and PlayStation 5 releases, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/">the Mature 17+ rating and its summary</a> don't reveal anything that wasn't already known about the game. Still, it's great to know that more players will soon be able to play one of the best survival horror games released in recent times.</p>



<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S is hardly a surprise. Earlier this month, known leaker Dusk Golem commented on the matter, saying not only that the game will be coming soon to Xbox consoles, but also that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-dlc-xbox-versions-announcement-rumored-to-be-tied-with-movies-release/">the Born of a Wish DLC campaign is getting remade, and that a new PlayStation 5 Pro patch will also be released</a> to solve some of the remaining issues the game has on the premium Sony console. All this should be announced soon, as the announcements should coincide with the marketing cycle of the Return to Silent Hill movie, which is set to hit theaters on January 23, 2026.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the Silent Hill 2 remake is not only a great remake of a now-classic survival horror game, but a great game in its own right. You can learn more about the game and what makes it such a good experience by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">checking out Chris Wray's review.</a></p>
