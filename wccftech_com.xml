			<p>It's not been a secret that the games market has been struggling for a while now, with there being constant layoffs and studio closures all across the globe, whether it be from people not playing the games, not wanting them, or just simply being unable to afford them. It's becoming increasingly common that games are getting more expensive, meaning people may not be able to find the money to purchase them, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. Despite these factors, it's been said that the games market will grow by 4.6%, in line with the expected inflation. This information comes from <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiDiA Research</a>'s Global Games Forecasts for 2025â€“2031, published earlier today.</p>
<p>One of the key points that is mentioned is that the games market is mature, so it is highly unlikely that it will ever experience double-digit growth again. The industry will only see slight growth during this period. It's also estimated that software revenues will continue to grow thanks to massive premium releases coming out this year. This includes Grand Theft Auto 6, Monster Hunter Wilds, and the games that will be released for the Nintendo Switch 2 when it inevitably releases.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, there are a ton of live-service games, with major developers deciding to try their luck with live-service games and not having the expected outcome. This has happened with multiple titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">MultiVersus</a>. However, it's predicted that instead of developing live-service games, developers will go back to premium games, with in-game spending decreasing to 67% near 2031.</p>
<p>"It is time to say goodbye to "survive 'til 25" and hello to "stick 'til 26" and beyond, but with tempered expectations for future growth in this mature market. The market (again, also including hardware, software, and subscriptions) will grow from $236.9 billion in 2025 to $280.1 billion in 2031," says Rhys Elliott, Games Analyst at MiDiA Research.</p>
<p>While there will always be a debate within the gaming community about whether mobile gaming makes you a gamer, mobile continues to do a significant amount of lifting for software revenue, with 54% of all software revenue coming from mobile games. The significant premium games being released this year will also be a huge boost for revenue, especially with games like Monster Hunter Wilds, Civilization VII, and Assassin's Creed Shadows all being released in Q1.</p>
<p>"Things will continue to be difficult in the games market, and these challenging market conditions mean developers are being forced to think smarter to succeed. Luckily, the industry is teeming with some of the smartest, most creative, and passionate minds in the world," says Elliott.</p>
