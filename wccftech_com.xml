			<p>New Battlefield 6 footage leaked online, providing a new look at the impressive destruction elements of the new entry in the series, ground vehicles, massive maps, and more.</p>
<p>The new footage, recorded during a recent alpha playtest conducted via the new testing environment Battlefield Labs, provides a great look at some of the features and mechanics that will be found in the next entry in the series, which has yet to be officially announced. The destruction mechanics, in particular, look quite impressive, as does the jet gameplay set in a map that looks outright massive.</p>

<p>The destructible elements have always been a very important part of the Battlefield experience, and they will be just as important as in the yet-to-be-officially-announced Battlefield 6. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">Earlier this month</a>, the development team provided an update on them, saying that their goals for destruction are <em>"centered around adding further gameplay depth by allowing you to reshape the environment and transform your surroundings toward a tactical advantage."</em>&nbsp; As highlighted by the new leaked gameplay, destruction is being designed around easily identifiable visual and audio language that will allow players to immediately understand what can be destroyed and altered, creating an intuitive and rewarding environment that players can easily shape.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 is currently in development for unspecified platforms. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>The Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916839982842450100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC system requirements</a> have been revealed today, detailing the system specifications needed to run the game at launch.</p>
<p>As expected for a multiplayer game aiming to get as many players on board as possible, the next game developed by FromSoftware is not going to be particularly demanding, as the developer recommends dated CPUs like the Intel Core i5-11500 and AMD Ryzen 5 5600 and GPUs like the GTX 1070 and Radeon RX Vega 56 to play the game, although it's not specified what resolution and framerate should be expected with the recommended specifications. Elden Ring Nightreign will also not require a lot of free storage space, as the game will only be 30 GB in size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The minimum and recommended PC specifications for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> are now available. <a href="https://t.co/pgfsTZzO1M">pic.twitter.com/pgfsTZzO1M</a></p>
<p>â€” ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1916839982842450100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When Elden Ring Nightreign was announced<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"> last year</a>, I wasn't particularly excited about its multiplayer approach, but the Closed Network Test held earlier this year made me more interested in the game. The experience was extremely easy to get into and fun, especially when all involved players properly worked together, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>The basics of Elden Ring Nightreign are really straightforward. From the iconic Roundtable Hold, players can decide to undertake expeditions with three other players, picking one of four Nightfarers, which will become eight in the launch version, all coming with unique special abilities, before getting thrown into one of the game's maps, where they need to survive for three days. At the end of the third day, the squad will get to fight one of the main bosses and will be rewarded with relics that represent the game's permanent upgrade system, which improves characters with a variety of different perks. Relics can also be obtained if the squad fails to get to the third day and defeat the final boss, so players still get something for taking part in expeditions.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 30th.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yotei%E2%80%99s-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more.1175313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40353">Famitsu</a>, (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-shares-new-ghost-of-yotei-details-as-the-games-non-linear-campaign-is-explained/">VGC</a>) Sucker Punch's Nate Fox and Jason Cornell, both co-creative directors on Ghost Of Yotei, spoke about the Yotei's non-linear campaign, the game's story, and a bit more about the setting, and the research Sucker Punch did while crafting Yotei.</p>
<p>Last week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">release date trailer</a> provided a few quick story details, like how the game centers around new protagonist Atsu's quest for revenge, which Fox reiterates in the interview here.</p>
<p>"<em>The main theme of this game is revenge. The main character, Atsu, has a big trauma in her childhood and goes on a journey to get revenge,</em>" Fox said.</p>
<p>Fox also described the game's map, saying, "<em>Ghost of Yotei has the greatest freedom and biggest map of any open-world game we have ever made</em>."</p>
<p>More interestingly, Fox and Cornell talked about the immense research they did on the studio's second attempt to capture Japan, how the studio collaborated with experts on Japanese history, and, of course, went to the Hokkaido prefecture, where the game is set.</p>
<p>"<em>We have received cooperation from various advisors regarding the depiction of the Ainu people and Ainu culture of the time. Like with the previous game, we have also thoroughly researched Japanese culture and incorporated it into this project,</em>" said Fox.</p>
<p>"<em>I also went to Hokkaido to research Ainu culture,</em>" Cornell added,&nbsp;"<em>and had people knowledgeable about Ainu culture introduce me to museums and folk crafts, which I incorporated into the worldview of this work. By the way, I also went to the mountains with them and had the experience of picking wild vegetables</em>."</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to arrive on PS5 this coming October 2, 2025, and while it'll surely be its own game compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, there are more than a few striking similarities between the two. The plot, for one, sticks out as a considerable similarity as they're both focused on tracking down several people who have wronged the protagonist.</p>
<p>Gameplay will surely be a big differentiating factor, but overall it'll be interesting to see how both games shape up by the time we've played Ghost of Yotei.</p>
