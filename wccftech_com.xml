			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for the launch of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-12-gb-graphics-card-launched-will-549-msrp-models-be-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card</a>. The driver is also optimized for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fragpunk-summer-game-fest-hands-on-impressions-its-in-the-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragpunk</a>. The latter game, a fast-paced 5v5 hero shooter from developer Bad Guitar Studio, will take advantage of the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, when it launches launch tomorrow. The game also supports ray tracing effects.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards can deliver an average 4.6x performance boost at 4K with all settings maxed out. On the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the game can reportedly run at almost 500 frames per second with ray tracing enabled and Super Resolution set to Performance mode with the newest transformer model. I would wager anyone should rather choose DLAA to get better image quality instead. Also, enabling NVIDIA Reflex can reduce your system's latency by up to 60%, which could make all the difference between life and death in a competitive multiplayer shooter like FragPunk.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, Nacon and Eko Software will also launch the fantasy action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished in early access, with day-one support for DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Dragonkin: The Banished is expected to stay in early access for seven to ten months.</p>
<p>Yesterday, two games launched with varying levels of NVIDIA RTX technology support. The first one is, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced</a>, which supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex, with Frame Generation slated to be added later. The other game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2678820/Vector_Strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vector Strike</a>, a free-to-play hybrid of sports game and first-person shooter based on fast-paced, physics-based action. In the title developed by Chamo Games, players face each other in a 4v4 arena. NVIDIA RTX users can enable DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Recently, Valve also introduced support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex (which can improve latency by up to 45% in this instance) in its upcoming game <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deadlock</a>, currently in testing with a selected number of users. The third-person 6v6 MOBA still doesn't have a release date.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Koei Tecmo's PC port of Rise of the Ronin (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched last year on consoles</a>) will support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation when it debuts <a href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-march-11th-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on March 11</a>.</p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kotaku</a>, the San Diego-based PlayStation studio Visual Arts Services has been hit with more layoffs. This week, an unspecified number of employees were notified that their last day with the company would be Friday, March 7. The news was shared publicly by former Visual Arts Project Manager Abby LeMaster (who left three years ago for Riot Games). In a LinkedIn message, she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abbynlemaster_it-was-tough-waking-up-to-messages-that-many-activity-7302431179213807617-xwpO?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that 'many' friends had just lost their jobs, lamenting that Sony had just let go of developers with a lot of experience. Here's a quote:</p>
<p><em>PlayStation Studios: Visual Arts was a playground, and it was also my first job in games. I started as an intern with an Information Systems degree, unsure of where I fit in, and met some of the most incredible people. It was a place where we got to experiment, learn, and contribute to projects that defined eras of gaming. The teams there were filled with artists, engineers, producers, and creatives who poured everything they had into their work. We chased excellence, and we built things we were proud of.</em></p>
<p><em>But also, more than anything, PSVA was about the people. The friendships I made there shaped me, and I carry those relationships with me to this day. The layoffs today hit hard. PSVA let go of developers with decades of subject matter expertise; talent that will be extraordinarily difficult to recoup. This industry can be unpredictable, but the skill, experience, and passion of the people I worked with at PSVA are undeniable.</em></p>
<p>Visual Arts had ambitious plans just a little over three years ago when studio head Michael Mumbauer <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-san-diego-studio-existing-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> to work on existing PlayStation franchises using the studio's own proprietary technology. Mumbauer wanted the studio to lead development on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of The Last of Us</a>, but PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst deemed the budget required too high, and Naughty Dog was once again put at the helm of the remake, with Visual Arts reverting to its usual supporting capacity. The team then also helped Naughty Dog with The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p>
<p>These new Visual Arts layoffs are only the latest to hit Sony teams. Last month, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on new cuts at the Technology Group. Of course, Firewalk Studios, developer of Concord, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down</a>. Overall, it's a widespread disease that runs rampant throughout the whole gaming industry, between rising game development budgets and reduced growth prospects.</p>
