			<p>Announced during QuakeCon 2025, id Software and Nightdive Studios have shadow dropped Heretic+Hexen, a remaster collection of the two magic-based FPS games built off the back of id Software's DOOM Engine originally developed by Raven Software in 1994 (Heretic) and 1995 (Hexen).</p>



<p>The collection is available right now on PC and all major console platforms, meaning you can grab it on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, though there's no specific Nintendo Switch 2 version. For Xbox players, it's also available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles, so Game Pass subscribers can download it to their preferred device and begin reliving the mid-90's shooters.</p>



<p>It'll also soon be playable through <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-mafia-the-old-country-titan-quest-ii-stormgate/">GeForce Now</a>, though a specific date for its inclusion in the GeForce Now roster has not been confirmed.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A nice boon for fans of the games who might've already purchased the digital versions of Heretic and Hexen available on the Xbox Store or Steam is that <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes">a free upgrade is available</a> for owners of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and/or Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel.</p>



<p>And if you're new to both shooters and are picking up the collection to play them for the first time, you'll be able to play through the three titles mentioned above, along with two brand new episodes made by Nightdive and id Software, titled: Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur.</p>



<p>The remasters feature improved performance on the classic titles with both games playable at a 4K resolution and at 120FPS, a wide range of accessibility options and game balancing options, widescreen support, mod support, and a new Vault section that includes early concept art for the development of both games and some unused sprites for fans of the originals to sink their teeth into.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft laying off 9,000+ people</a> across its whole company resulted in a number of projects being cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">a new MMO from ZeniMax Online</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, Rare's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Everwild</a>, and as we just learned earlier today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/">Contraband, from Avalanche Studios</a>. One game that isn't cancelled however, according to a Microsoft spokesperson, is Hideo Kojima's horror game he's making in collaboration with Xbox, OD.</p>



<p>That news comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who in his reporting on Contraband, asked after the status of OD, which is another project from Microsoft that was announced years ago, though we've heard very little of since. He reports that he was told by a Microsoft spokesperson that OD "<em>is still in development</em>."</p>







<p>OD was first announced during <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">The Game Awards 2023 showcase</a>, and was such an exciting announcement at the time, that it was the one game out of everything else announced that year that <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojimas-od-topped-tga-2023-press-coverage-says-fancensus/">dominated press coverage of TGA 2023</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, however, we've heard very little about OD. Kojima has mentioned it and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-provides-update-on-death-stranding-2-and-his-many-other-productions/">work he's doing on it in passing</a>, and has also talked about how his goals with OD is to make something that players have not necessarily seen before. He's called it a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/">"<em>risky</em>" game</a> that will be<a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"> "<em>divisive</em>,"</a> but at the same time it sounds like he's excited to be making something that he knows will push players, something he knows that not everyone will fall head-over-heels for.</p>



<p>Horror-director Jordan Peele is also meant to be working on OD alongside Kojima and Xbox, though what we know about Peele's involvement so far is equal to what we know about OD itself, which is very little.</p>



<p>Perhaps now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has launched and is on store shelves, we'll soon start to hear more about what's happening with OD, and get a more official word/sign on if it's happening at all. </p>
