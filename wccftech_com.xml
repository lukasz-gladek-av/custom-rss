			<p>The action survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forever-skies-apocalyptic-adventure/">Forever Skies</a> from Polish developer Far From Home has launched in 1.0 and is out of early access today, April 14, 2025. It's currently available to download on both PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>Forever Skies originally launched on PC in early access on June 22, 2023, and developer Far From Home has spent the last nearly two years updating and, at times, overhauling it to prepare for today's 1.0 launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies | 1.0 Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaGXUFm7Vtc?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Speaking of new content, today's 1.0 launch includes a bunch of new content, including the addition of biomes, new locations, and new colossal lifeforms, advancements to airship building with new designs for players to dig into, new tools and technologies for players to use, some balance tweaks, performance optimizations, and, of course, the final chapter of the story.</p>
<p>"<em>We’re extremely proud to be launching Forever Skies 1.0 officially today,</em>" chief executive officer of Far From Home Andrzej Blumenfeld said in a <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/uk/bastion-uk/pressreleases/we-have-lift-off-soar-into-the-skies-as-forever-skies-1-dot-0-officially-launches-today-on-pc-and-playstation-r-5-3381096">press release</a> about the launch.</p>
<p>"<em>We spent 21+ months in Early Access, working really closely with our community who helped us to shape the game every step of the way. So to them and everyone who got behind us, we want to say a massive thank you!</em>"</p>
<p>We reviewed Forever Skies in its early access state a few months ahead of this 1.0 launch, and at the time, even in early access, it was already a very impressive title.</p>
<p>"<em>Forever Skies has a great, relaxing core gameplay</em> <em>loop</em>," we wrote in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forever-skies-apocalyptic-adventure/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>"The atmospheres are vibrant, but still provide the feeling of desolation and complete loneliness. It's very easy to dive into, once you get past the laggy and broken cutscene at the beginning of the game. Overall, Forever Skies is a great experience, and significantly less overwhelming than other games in this genre."</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launched on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC three weeks ago, and according to data from Circana, it has been the best-selling game in the US each of those weeks.</p>
<p>Executive director and video game industry analyst at Circana Mat Piscatella took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24">BlueSky</a> on Monday and announced that Shadows has stayed in the top spot for weekly game sales in the United States since it launched on March 20, 2025.</p>
<p>Piscatella also confirmed that Assassin's Creed Shadows is now the second-best-selling game in the United States for 2025, trailing behind Capcom's smash success to start the year, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>"<em>Here's a fun one...Assassin's Creed: Shadows has been the best-selling video game in the US for each of its first 3 weeks in market, according to Circana's Retail Tracking Service (dollar sales, latest data through April 5th)</em>," Piscatella wrote on BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em>Currently ranks #2 year-to-date trailing only Monster Hunter: Wilds</em>."</p>
<p>Just two days after launching, Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed Shadows had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/">surpassed 2 million players worldwide</a>&nbsp;after it broke <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/">one million copies sold</a> on launch day. A week after it launched, Ubisoft confirmed it had gone even further and blown past <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/">3 million players</a>.</p>
<p>These milestones and financial achievements are enormous wins for Ubisoft, a company that desperately needed a win after 2024 was filled with major financial misses. Both of Ubisoft's big-budget games for 2024, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/">Skull &amp; Bones</a>,&nbsp;missed the mark in several ways, including commercially, which made the cloud above the company only grow darker&nbsp;as more and more pressure weighed on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows success.</p>
<p>Ubisoft recently underwent a significant structural change, with its biggest series, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, all being moved to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/"> a new subsidiary</a> in which Tencent is a minority partner.</p>
<p>Plans for this new subsidiary are still unclear, with a<a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/"> recently leaked internal memo</a> including hints that layoffs could still very well be coming as the company adjusts to its new structure. We can only hope that Assassin's Creed Shadows's major success helps alleviate some of the losses, should they still occur.</p>
