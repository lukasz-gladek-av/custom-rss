			<p>Nacon has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/538859942242681786?l=english">announced</a> the Year 2 roadmap for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, detailing the highlights that will be a part of each season, including this week's Season 4, all the way up to Season 8, which will debut in July 2026. </p>



<p>KT Racing and Nacon put together an hour-long developer update that digs into what's to come, along with a short retrospective on how things have gone since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> launched last September.</p>

<p>Starting with what's to come in the short term, Season 4 is launching this coming Wednesday, July 23, 2025, and with it five new cars, new content like Casino, a new currency for players to earn called Diamonds, and other enhancements to the game. </p>



<p>There's also a key community feature that's live from now until August 4, 2025, which is that players will be able to vote on which new mission type will be added to Solar Crown. Detective, Delivery, Photography, and Adrenaline are the four types players can choose from, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdV49jCWe1BvGaZpkgYEpdY0tTJOSYappAnQj0V06ZYg7gEuQ/viewform">you can submit your vote until August 4th at this link</a>.</p>

<p>Season 5 will arrive in October of this year, which is also when Year 2 will officially kick off. That's when taxi missions will be making their return, and when a new online store will be introduced. There will also be re-balances to the in-game economy, new vehicles, and a bevy of performance and graphical boosts that'll be directly from the KT Engine getting its own upgrade. </p>



<p>Season 6 kicks off January 2026, and it's also when the mission players voted for will be added to the game, among the other usual features like new cars and improvements to the game.</p>



<p>Season 7 arrives in April 2026, bringing along with it the introduction of Official Racing Centers, dedicated racing venues for Hong Kong Island and Ibiza City, and a revamping of live events and the premium Solar Pass. Finally, Season 8 arrives as previously mentioned in July 2026, which will be highlighted by the return of Housing and Real Estate, two elements missing from Solar Crown that players loved in the first two Test Drive Unlimited games. It'll also add Extreme missions and Passenger mode, along with the rest of the usual suspects. </p>



<p>Beyond Season 8, Nacon and KT Racing are committed to continuing to update and improve Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, as the team is already considering adding elements like bikes and yachts.</p>
