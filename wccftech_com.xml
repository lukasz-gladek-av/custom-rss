			<p>March is coming up fast, which means it’s nearly time for another <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dose of wrasslin’ game goodness</a>, with 2K officially unveiling WWE 2K26 today. CM Punk is once again gracing the cover this year (a Punk with less gray in his beard appeared on the cover of WWE 2K13) and will be starring in this year’s 2K Showcase mode. Punk is far from the only wrestler in the game, as developer Visual Concepts has apparently packed a whopping 400+ Superstars into WWE 2K26 at launch – a number that will only expand with DLC, etc. You can check out a handful of early screenshots of WWE 2K26, below.</p>

<p>Visual Concepts is also promising four new match types -- I Quit, Inferno, Three Stages of Hell, and Dumpster – as well as some new plunder to use against opponents, such as shopping carts and thumb tacks. Ultimately though, perhaps most exciting for folks like myself who have been playing WWE 2K forever, Visual Concepts have promised a full revamp of the reversal and stamina system, which has long been a glaring weak point for the series. We still don’t know much about <em>how</em> these systems are changing, but apparently the updates will “add a new layer of strategy,” which is exactly the kind of thing I was begging for in last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/">WWE 2K25 review</a>. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of some other new features coming in WWE 2K26…</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Creation Suite</strong> - 2X the CAS and Image Slots, Plus Body Morphing: The best-in-class customization mode now offers 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots, doubling the existing count in response to community demand. Community Creations now features a doubled image capacity of 2,000, deeper body and face morphing tools, and two-tone hair color blending, giving players unprecedented freedom to craft the Superstars, arenas, and other creations of their dreams.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>MyGM</strong> - More Shows, More Superstars Per Match: New Intergender Matches, 5, 6, and 8-manmatches, plus support for more match types than ever before, vastly increase the number of&nbsp; possible matches and outcomes. More shows per season pose new management challenges in2K’s strategic brand management simulation mode.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>MyRise</strong> - New Theme, Increased Replay Value: Players define their MySuperstar’s journey through two new division-based storylines where villainous or heroic decisions impact MyPlayers like never before. Players can now keep playing even after the main stories are complete, with more unlockable content and achievements to earn for increased replayability.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>The Island</strong> - New Storyline and Environment, Available on All Platforms: 2K’s WWE-themed world is now bigger and more social than ever, and available for the first time on PC. Players will choose one of three factions and battle for control with a revamped progression system. The new Scrapyard Brawl environment, fresh Towers, new shops and branded gear, an expanded MySuperstar builder with face-photo importing, plus upgraded quests, complete with Superstar voiceovers, cutscenes and dialogue screens, enhance the immersive experience.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, WWE 2K26 is coming in the usual dizzying array of special editions, and, in fact, 2K is pushing the bar further than ever this year, with the $150 Monday Night War Edition. Here are the different ways you can buy WWE 2K26:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> is $70.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>King of Kings Edition</strong> will be available for $1oo. King of Kings Edition includes the Standard Edition, Joe Hendry Pack, Ringside Pass Premium Season 1, and 32,500 VC, plus the King of Kings Pack which includes playable Superstars Triple H ‘98 and Stephanie McMahon ‘00, and a “Triple H Signature Taunt” Emote for The Island.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Attitude Era Edition</strong> will be available for $130. In addition to all content included in the King of Kings Edition, Attitude Era Edition includes access to Ringside Pass Premium Seasons 1-4,plus the Attitude Era Edition Pack, which features playable Superstars The Rock ‘99, Kane ‘98, and Chyna ‘97, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin “Rattlesnake” and The Rock “People’s Champ” MyFaction EVO cards, the Raw is War ‘98 Arena, and Undertaker “Thumb Across the Neck” and Shawn Michaels “DX Crotch Chop” Emotes for The Island. The Superstar Mega-Boost is also included, which grants 200 MySuperstar attribute points for MyRise plus 100,000 VC.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Monday Night War Edition</strong> will be available for $150. In addition to all content included in the Attitude Era Edition, Monday Night War Edition includes access to Ringside Pass Premium Seasons 1-6, plus the Monday Night War Edition Pack, which features playable Superstars Shawn Michaels DX, Macho Man Randy Savage ‘98, Rowdy Roddy Piper ‘98, the WCW Thunder ‘98 Arena, and a Diamond Dallas Page “Bang!” Emote for The Island. Monday Night War Edition also grants entitlement for the WrestleMania 42 Pack, which includes the WrestleMania42 Arena and three WrestleMania 42 Superstar Persona Cards to be automatically entitled post-launch.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Oh, and yes, there will now be a premium battle pass, er, sorry, “Ringside Pass” offered as well. Here are the details on that.</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ringside Passes</strong> - DLC Gets an Upgrade with More Post-Launch Content Than Ever Before: The all-new Ringside Pass offers players additional incentive to play, earning XP across all game modes, excluding online lobbies. 60 free tiers and 40 premium tiers will be available to reward gameplay, with players who can reach tier 40 of the Ringside Pass Premium Season able to unlock Superstars, cosmetic and customization items, VC, MyFaction and The Island content, and more. The Ringside Pass Premium replaces the previous DLC model, rewarding players with all-new playable characters unavailable on the base game roster, including current Superstars, Legends, Personas, and some unexpected names. Six Ringside Pass Seasons are planned to roll out throughout the year, with Ringside Pass Season 1 available at launch and featuring unlockable Superstars and Legends, previously available in the WWE 2K Supercharger, on the free tier.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>WWE 2K26 hits PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch 2 (yes, “last gen” versions seem to finally be behind us) on March 13, unless you buy the King of Kings Edition or above, in which case, you’ll be able to play a week early on March 6.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amazon-adds-to-god-of-war-tv-cast-with-alastair-duncan-returning-as-mimir-and-two-new-picks-for-brok-and-sindri/</link>
            <guid>1421299</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong> is certainly ramping up, as we've just had another <strong>three casting announcements</strong> after two new cast members were announced just yesterday. A report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-alastair-duncan-mimir-brok-sindri-1236645903/">Variety</a> confirms previous rumours that <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> <strong>will</strong> <strong>reprise his role as Mimir</strong>, while <strong>Danny Woodburn</strong> (Seinfeld, 90210) and <strong>Jeff Gulka</strong> (The X Files, Once Upon a Time) will play the dwarf brothers <strong>Brok</strong> and <strong>Sindri</strong>, respectively.</p>



<p>Duncan, Woodburn, and Gulka are the sixth, seventh, and eighth additions to the cast that we've heard about, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> was cast as <strong>Kratos</strong></a>, followed by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer </strong></a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">getting tapped to play <strong>Sif</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/"><strong>Max Parker</strong> getting cast as <strong>Heimdall</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong> accepting the role of <strong>Thor</strong></a>, and last night's latest addition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong> stepping in to play <strong>Odin</strong>,</a> replacing The West Wing's <strong>Richard Schiff</strong>, who voiced him in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>All of these casting announcements have happened within the month of <strong>January 2026</strong>, with Ryan Hurst being named as Kratos kicking things off just two weeks ago. We may not get the rest of the cast revealed today, but it certainly feels like we have more announcements coming, and that Amazon is trying to get all of these reveals out before the show starts filming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">which is reportedly due sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With Brok, Sindri, and Mimir now settled, other remaining casting choices include <strong>Freya, Baldur</strong>, and, of course, <strong>Atreus</strong>. There are more characters we could see cast for the series, though we can't exactly speculate that we're waiting on casting choices for characters like <strong>Tyr</strong>, <strong>Magni,</strong> <strong>Modi</strong>, <strong>Freyr</strong>, <strong>Thrúd</strong>, and <strong>Angrboda</strong> until we know a bit more about the show's plot direction.</p>



<p>Right now, we know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be pulling from the Norse mythology-based games from 2018 and 2022, but that's about it. The character descriptions included in Variety's report don't include any new information that those who've played the games don't already know, so for now we're left waiting until Amazon, <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong>, and Moore can start talking about the show they're planning.</p>



<p>Even though it is focusing on the Norse-based games, it would be exciting to see callbacks to Kratos' days running around Olympus. It seems unavoidable for the show not to address Kratos' past, which opens up an even bigger can of worms regarding which characters are left to be cast. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-split-fiction-film-with-sydney-sweeney-has-a-script-says-hazelight-boss-josef-fares/</link>
            <guid>1421248</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Split Fiction</strong> is one of the many video game-to-film or TV adaptations that <strong>Amazon</strong> has under its belt, and it appears that the adaptation starring <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/"><strong>Sydney Sweeney</strong> and directed by <strong>Jon M. Chu</strong></a> has hit a major milestone in the course of its production, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hazelight-studio-josef-fares-next-game-better-than-split-fiction/"><strong>Hazelight </strong>boss <strong>Josef Fares</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezone</a> in a red carpet interview at the <strong>Guldbagge Awards</strong> (spotted and translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>), Fares confirmed that he had seen the first finalized version of the script, and confirmed that he's met Sydney Sweeney in a meeting, but he's not holding his breath about anything just yet. </p>



<p>"<em>I got the first version of the script today," </em>Fares told Moviezone<em>, "but you know, there’s so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this ‘I believe it when I see it.'</em>" Regarding Sweeney, Fares didn't have much to add beyond, "<em>I’ve had a meeting with her and she seems super chill</em>."</p>



<p>We first learned that a Split Fiction movie was in the works back in April 2025, but it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/">June 2025 that Amazon MGM won the bidding war</a> to get the film's production rights that it had found a home. Now, it has a script, and while there are plenty of steps to go before we can really start to look forward to the movie, it's better to hear some updates instead of nothing, which is currently the case with <a href="https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-is-coming-to-tv-and-movies-thanks-to-dj2-entertainment-deal/">the <strong>It Takes Two </strong>film that was announced back in 2022,</a> and we haven't heard anything about it since.</p>



<p>Split Fiction isn't the only video game adaptation Sweeney is working on, as she's also signed on to <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">produce an adaptation of <strong>Out Run</strong> alongside <strong>Michael Bay</strong></a>. As for Amazon, it is currently days away from the premiere of the season two finale for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Fallout </strong>TV show adaptation</a>, and lately we've been hearing a lot about the cast for the coming <strong>God of War </strong>TV series, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Mandy Patinkin</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Teresa Palmer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Max Parker</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong> all confirmed to be a part of the cast.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gamestop-ceo-has-a-plan-to-earn-his-35b-bonus-acquire-a-massive-publicly-traded-company-in-a-genius-or-totally-foolish-move/</link>
            <guid>1421209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>GameStop</strong> chief executive officer <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong> has the chance at a major, major payday if he can make good on a goal set for him by GameStop's board of directors. Amidst discovering that GameStop would be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/">shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</a></strong>, we also learned that if Cohen successfully turned the company that's worth a staggering <strong>$100 billion</strong>, then he would earn a <strong>$35 billion bonus</strong>. And now, it seems that Cohen has a plan on how to make that happen.</p>



<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/gamestop-ceo-plans-e8440c4b">Wall Street Journal</a>, the plan is essentially to buy his way to that growth by expanding beyond more than just being a video games retailer. Cohen plans to acquire a publicly traded company in a "<em>big</em>" deal, with the Journal identifying he'll be looking "<em>likely in the consumer or retail industry</em>."</p>



<p>On his plan, Cohen added, "<em>It's ultimately either going to be <strong>genius or totally, totally foolish</strong>."</em></p>



<p>Currently, GameStop is worth about <strong>$11 billion</strong>. To earn the full $35 billion bonus, Cohen would have to turn GameStop into a $100 billion market-cap company and reach a <strong>$10 billion</strong> EBITDA measure. Even when <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/">GameStop had its meteoric meme-stock rise back in 2021</a>, the company's market cap peaked at <strong>$33.7 billion</strong>, which falls more than a few billion short of Cohen's goal.</p>



<p>That said, the Journal's report adds that Cohen could still earn a partial bonus by increasing the company's market cap beyond <strong>$20 billion</strong> and reaching a <strong>$2 billion </strong>EBITDA measure. It won't be the full $35 billion, but if Cohen can manage to recreate some of the success that the company lucked into in 2021, he'll be able to take some sort of bonus home. </p>



<p>"<em>There are a lot of diamonds in the rough…that have sleepy management teams</em>," Cohen said about his plan and the layoffs GameStop has already been through. "<em>I didn’t fix GameStop to stop there</em>." The jury is still out as to whether Cohen did actually fix GameStop, which seems more interested <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">in making meme and troll-centred comments online</a> and closing stores than selling video games, but since Cohen did this interview with the Wall Street Journal, the company's stock was up <strong>3.5%</strong> this morning.</p>

			<p>A <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <strong>Baldur's Gate 3 mod</strong></a> aims to <strong>restore several deleted scenes</strong> from the game's early access version, which ran on PC for nearly three years before the full launch. Aptly titled '<strong>Early Access Scenes Restored</strong>', the mod created by Nexus user HyperspaceTowel has managed to reinject a lot of cut content and even create brand new cutscenes. Here's the overview:</p>



<ul>
<li>More NPC encounters and camp events</li>



<li>More companion reactivity</li>



<li>More approvals (or disapprovals)</li>



<li>Brand new content: some of the cutscenes were made from scratch</li>
</ul>



<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 mod adds back these NPCs and camp events:</p>



<ul>
<li>Visiting the camp for the first time</li>



<li>Enthralled fishermen</li>



<li>Nerela</li>



<li>Rurik</li>



<li>Seashell kid</li>



<li>Gale's deer stew</li>



<li>Gale's loss</li>



<li>Post-Druid civil war</li>



<li>Shadowheart's ultimatum</li>



<li>Ceremorphosis beckons...</li>
</ul>



<p>Several of the companions already available in the game's first Act, like Astarion, Gale, Lae'zel, Shadowheart, Karlach, and Wyll, now react to specific story events once again. The modder also claims to have reworked some scene cinematics to improve the camera work and timing. Some Early Access cut lines were spliced into the full release dialogues, some Origin dialogue options were added here and there, and brand new scenes were created for Wyll and Karlach.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to the modder, there's still more cut Baldur's Gate 3 content to restore, including Thralls on the Nautiloid, even more Wyll and Karlach reactivity, and additional voiced dialogue for Tav.</p>



<p>In other Baldur's Gate 3 news, earlier this month, <strong>Larian</strong> CEO <strong>Swen Vincke</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-would-have-loved-baldurs-gate-3-switch-2-wasnt-our-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented on the lack of a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version</a>. He said the developer would have loved to port the game to the hybrid console, hinting that the reason it doesn't exist is due to the IP owner, <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>.</p>
