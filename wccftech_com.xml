			<p>The second Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 PC patch is now live, introducing various improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.212.1.0 focuses mostly on stability improvements based on the developer's research and player reports. Among these are stability improvements on AMD GPUs introduced by disabling Anti-Lag 2, as the initialization of the tech's SDK caused driver crashes and, thus, instability.</p>
<p>Stability improvements are only some of the enhancements the new Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch brings. According to the full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/576000532521418781?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, game version 1.212.1.0 also featured improved adjustability of Mouse Sensitivity, improved screen-space reflections, and new NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction options that allow users to enable it at native resolution and with the Ultra Performance setting. Rounding up the new additions included in today's patch are a variety of bug fixes and the ability to use Nintendo Switch Pro controllers with Steam Input.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 was released two weeks ago on PC, and its launch was far from the best for PlayStation to PC ports due to stability issues and other visual issues, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">launch report</a>, which have yet to be completely fixed.</p>
<p><em>However, in between the crashes, I also noticed a graphics issue during cutscenes with character hair flickering in a very distracting way. Between this, the crashes, and the fact that NVIDIA said DLSS Multi Frame Generation will be added soon to the game, it's best to take a rain check on the PC version for the time being.</em></p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

			<p>As showcased in the State of Play yesterday, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has an official release date of August 28, 2025. This title will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. For those in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) you are already able to pre-order this title on your chosen platform, with some differences in the editions that are available.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is set to be a faithful remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, an iconic game that was originally released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2. However, with a new generation being introduced to Solid Snake, as well as loyal fans wanting more Metal Gear Solid action, a remake was the perfect way to introduce newcomers to the franchise. The remake will star the original English and Japanese voice actors, with a rich and intense storyline and some<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/"> new expansive features</a> of the combat system with brand-new graphics and immersive sound.</p>
<p>If you are yet to see the trailer, here is what you missed from last night's State of Play.</p>

<p>If you know that you plan on getting this game, pre-orders are already open in EMEA, as stated above. There are multiple editions available, with some of the editions providing you with DLC that can give you some extra cosmetics to play with.</p>

<p><iframe title="METAL EDEN Reveal trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68SmDHGzu3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metal Eden is a sci-fi FPS title where you get to explore a world where humanity's consciousness is no longer being held in captivity in the flesh and now resides within robots. There will be eight missions for you to make your way through, with a handcrafted universe to explore. This game will see you plunged into an artificial world full of cybernetic warfare, where you'll be given the opportunity to take control of a hyper unit while also exploring the world and uncovering the mysteries of the futuristic world before you.</p>
<p>In Metal Eden, you take on the role of ASKA, which is an advanced Hyper Unit android that has been built around a digitized human psyche. The architecture in the world around you is bathed in neon lights, helping to immerse you into the cyber-futuristic world in front of you, which has been named Moebius. As you explore Moebius, you will find yourself participating in the ongoing conflict over the souls of a lost human colony that are stored in cybernetic COREs.</p>
<p>On this journey, you are accompanied by your sentient spaceship named Nexus. As you progress through the story, you will expand and upgrade your arsenal, as well as make your robotic body even stronger and more robust to be able to continue fighting off enemies in a mechanical world. By fighting the diverse roster of enemies, you will have to extract energy cores that will provide you with an advantage on the battlefield. Along with upgrading your weaponry, you'll also get to upgrade and obtain new combat abilities that will make you a force of nature.</p>
<p>If you like parkour in your games, you'll want to keep an eye on Metal Eden, as you are able to dash, grapple, and wall-run your way through Moebius while taking on enemies in intense encounters.</p>
<p>Metal Eden will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on May 6, 2025.</p>
