			<p>In September, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Take-Two tried to save the Perfect Dark reboot that was in development at The Initiative (with the help of Crystal Dynamics), but an agreement could not be reached with IP holder Microsoft about the future of the franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Schreier has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3m7izaecnvc2j?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed up</a>, adding that Take-Two has nonetheless hired two key developers from the Perfect Dark team to found a new 2K studio. They are Darrell Gallagher, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-tomb-raider-david-gallaggher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Studio Head at the Initiative</a> (and formerly Studio Head at Crystal Dynamics), and Brian Horton. The latter worked at Crystal Dynamics with Gallagher on 2013's Tomb Raider and 2015's Rise of the Tomb Raider before moving to Insomniac, where he contributed to many games, including Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and the upcoming Marvel's Wolverine. He had <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-gets-ex-marvels-wolverine-lead-as-new-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined The Initiative in late 2024 as the new Creative Director</a>, but the project, as we all know, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially canceled in July 2025</a> by Microsoft, which also shut down the studio.</p>



<p>It's not the first time Take-Two scoops up an industry veteran to found a new studio within 2K. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-new-studio-michael-condrey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already happened a few years ago with Michael Condrey</a>, the former studio head of Sledgehammer Games and, before that, co-creator of Dead Space (alongside Glen Schofield) at Visceral Games. That team, based in Silicon Valley, is known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/31st-union-michael-condrey-2k-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">31st Union</a>, though Condrey himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-removes-31st-union-president-michael-condrey-insists-project-ethos-is-still-being-worked-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was fired earlier this year</a> following the tepid response to the studio's free-to-play roguelike hero third-person shooter game Project ETHOS, which is, however, reportedly still in development.</p>



<p>Given the average time of triple-A game development in 2025, we may not hear about this new Take-Two studio for another three or four years. Still, we'll keep you updated on any further rumors and leaks.</p>

			<p>Journalist Stephen Totilo has <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the current developer of the Star Wars KOTOR Remake. It's Mad Head Games, the Serbian studio behind defunct hack 'n' slash action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/pagan-online-revealed-debut-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pagan Online</a> and sci-fi action/adventure game Scars Above (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/scars-above-the-definition-of-one-and-done/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we reviewed here</a>). They're also working on Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-gamescom-hands-on-preview-pleasure-and-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which we previewed at Gamescom 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Mad Head Games is a subsidiary of Saber Interactive, following the split from the Embracer Group. We knew that a team at Saber was working on the game. A year and a half ago, their CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the development was progressing well.</p>



<p>Let's rewind the long and problematic development story of the Star Wars KOTOR Remake. The first rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-might-be-getting-a-reimagining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started circulating in January 2020</a>, before the world was even fully aware of COVID-19. The game was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the September 2021 PlayStation Showcase as an exclusive for PC and PlayStation 5. Back then, Aspyr Media was working on it, but their project <a href="https://wccftech.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was paused in mid-2022</a> following an unsuccessful demo presentation to Sony and Lucasfilm. Shortly afterward, we learned that the developer had changed, but we never knew the exact studio until now.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Totilo revealed that Disney and Lucasfilm Games have been planning a Star Wars KOTOR II remake (codenamed Juliet) as well, as recently as March 2025, which would also include the content cut from the original version. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1phogew/comment/nt0ij6e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a Reddit post</a>, he then explained that the info comes from a legal deposition:</p>



<p><em>Yes, this is more than a rumor because the person who talked about it during their legal deposition was Douglas Reilly, the longtime VP of Lucasfilm Games. The reason for the March cut-off on this is because that's when the deposition was. At that time, he said it "is still technically on the road map” and that “we’re starting with the remake of KOTOR I." I don't know about the status of either KOTOR remake since then.</em></p>



<p>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was originally developed by BioWare. Launched in July 2003, it is considered to be one of the best RPGs of all time, although its combat system would feel pretty dated nowadays and must certainly be among the most significant changes in the KOTOR Remake, just like with Final Fantasy VII. Its sequel, KOTOR II: The Sith Lords, was developed by Obsidian and launched in December 2004. It was also well received, although not quite to the extent of the first franchise entry.</p>



<p>As a separate rumor from Totilo's reveal, leaker Kurakasis <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1997385253795590237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that a major Star Wars game announcement, whose title ends with "The Old Republic," is coming soon, presumably hinting at a reveal during The Game Awards 2025. That said, take this piece of info with a grain of salt.</p>
