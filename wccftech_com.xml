			<p>SEGA's latest trailer for the next Sonic game calls out Nintendo, and no, we've not time-travelled back to the 80s/90s. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is due out next week at the time of this writing on September 25, 2025, and ahead of that launch, and the release of a demo this coming Wednesday, September 17, SEGA put out a new trailer showcasing CrossWorlds that included a coy call out to Nintendo's Mario Kart franchise.</p>



<p>The trailer is titled, "<em>Come Race on Our Level</em>," and begins with a blurred image of Mario Kart on one screen with a narrator saying, "<em>We all know that kart racing game. It's great. We don't need to show it to you.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>But what if you can blast through and race on a whole other level?</em>,<em>"</em> the narrator continues, before diving into a showcase of gameplay from Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer goes on to list a few gameplay features in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and before it ends, takes one more shot at Mario Kart, though the second seems more specifically targeted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, by listing a slew of features in CrossWorlds and then saying, "<em>Or, what if you want to roam around on the open road?</em>"</p>



<p>It's all just a bit of fun, of course, but there's a certain tinge of nostalgia the comes from seeing SEGA pull stunts like this.</p>



<p>In any case, players will be able to make up their own minds if Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be worth picking up for their Nintendo Switch 2 consoles or other devices, as a demo will be available on all platforms tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Developer GFA Games has announced today that its upcoming MMOFPS game Pioner will host an Open Beta test at some point in October. The game is still scheduled to launch later this year on PC, with consoles to follow at a later time.</p>



<p>Pioner was actually already available <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-demo-confirmed-for-steam-next-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a limited time as part of June's Steam Next Fest</a>. Following that test, GFA Games shared some adjustments planned for Pioner's PvP mode:</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Current Capture Point Method:</strong> We’re working on making the “Capture the Flag” mode feel more classic. Players will no longer be forced to spend excessive time capturing a flag.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Point Names: </strong>We'll assign point names — A, B, and C — to make it easier for players to navigate the map and communicate with each other.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Enemy visualization in TDM:</strong> We're addressing visibility issues by adding a special type of visualization for enemies (NPCs and players) that makes them stand out against the environment. We're also adjusting lighting components that interfere with visibility.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Player movement:</strong> We’ll work on fixing player movement desynchronization, which can cause noticeable "jitter" in the movement of enemies and allies.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit registration:</strong> The netcode is still being fine-tuned. It’s not fully polished yet, which may cause hits not to register or kills/deaths to happen much faster than intended.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Hit collision:</strong> We’ll improve hitbox accuracy on certain environmental objects. We tried to identify as many of these issues as possible before the test, but some may still remain in certain areas of the map.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Balance: </strong>We’ve gathered all the current feedback on PvP weapon balance and will make additional adjustments in the near future.</em></li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Honestly, though, the game generally felt rough during the Steam Next Fest demo. As someone who has been looking forward to Pioner for a while (you might have guessed it from the two <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviews</a> I previously conducted with GFA Games), I think it could use some additional time in the oven to improve its polish. Still, maybe there was a big improvement in the last four months, so let's check this new build first. Meanwhile, check out the new gameplay trailer embedded above.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher is set to begin its fourth and second-last season this coming October 30, 2025, the streaming company has announced, with Liam Hemsworth in Geralt's boots after Henry Cavill left the show. Alongside the <a href="https://x.com/witchernetflix/status/1967075836911030453">premiere date announcement</a>, Netflix also debuted the first proper clip of Hemsworth in the role.</p>



<p>While Cavill got the show going, and Netflix's adaptation is certainly part of what helped get the momentum going in what can now be called a renaissance for videogame to TV and film adaptations, it'll be up to Hemsworth to close out the show as he helms its final two seasons, which were shot all together so once filming ended, Netflix just had to put it together.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>As a </em><em>Witcher</em> fan, I’m over the moon about the opportunity to play Geralt of Rivia," Hemsworth said, per a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth">a blog post from Netflix's Tudum website</a>.</p>



<p>Like other streamers, Netflix has added other videogame adaptations since it helped kick things off with The Witcher. It currently has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed</a> show in the works, and on the animated front, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-confirmed/">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> is coming back with a second season.</p>



<p>Henry Cavill also isn't done with videogame adaptations, as he's ecstatically working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/">Warhammer adaptation</a>.</p>

			<p>A few attempts have been made in the past few years to turn the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> into a portable console, but few are as impressive as a recent attempt whose creation has been documented in a video shared on YouTube.</p>



<p>User <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TERA_PS345">TERA</a>, who has built plenty of impressive DIY console models in the past, documented their second attempt at creating a PlayStation 5 portable edition in a new video which goes over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THm4TCUNmIw">some areas of improvements over the previous attempt</a>, disassembly, cooling system changes to make the new DIY edition of the system possible, the reasons behind the new enclosure and LCD panel choices, component assembly, and more. The end results are extremely impressive from every point of view: the system is quite silent considering the new cooling system even during gameplay, its size is relatively small, and its weight is quite light, lighter not only than the previous attempt but also than a regular PlayStation 5 mode, definitely helping portability.</p>

<p>Although Sony is likely never releasing a full-fledged PlayStation 5 portable edition, the Japanese company already released different edition of its PlayStation 5 system, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-slimmer-revision/">a slimmer version of both the Standard Edition and the Digital Edition</a> that launched in late 2023 alongside a detachable disc drive, and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5-pro/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> model that allows users to enjoy console games at their best thanks to better specs and support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">next version is set to launch next year</a>.

			<p>Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of 2025's breakout hits. It currently stands as the best-rated game that came out in 2025 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">reached 3.3 million copies sold just 33 days after its launch</a>. Now, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VrnDS-mko0&amp;t=196s">interview</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/clair-obscur-expedition-33-quietly-tops-44-million-in-sales-1601503/">Gamereactor</a>, we know that the game has reached another sales milestone, hitting 4.4 million copies sold.</p>



<p>Speaking to French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ClipsDuLundiV2">Clips du lundi</a>, when technical character artist Amandine Marest, producer Benjamin Dimanche, and senior gameplay programmer Florian Torres were asked about an update on sales, they gave away the goose that, while the public number is "<em>officially</em>" still the previously announced 3.3 million, Marest confirmed that sales had hit 4.4 million.</p>



<p>"<em>Officially, 3.3 million, but it's 4.4 million</em>," Torres then clarified.</p>

<iframe title="L'interview de 3 membres du studio de Clair Obscur par Antoine au ZEVENT ! BO de MK meilleure ?!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VrnDS-mko0?start=196&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's a strong milestone for an indie game that in many respects came out of nowhere, despite being featured in multiple Xbox showcases. Sandfall Interactive's story is not uncommon in the videogame industry. A studio born out of developers leaving the triple-A space, looking to make the kind of game they've always wanted to see, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix/">inspirations drawn from games they loved</a> is old-hat in this industry. </p>



<p>It's less common for studios that share those origins to find the kind of wild success Sandfall has found, especially when considering how much of a game's sales can be eroded by being available through a subscription service, like Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>And by the sounds of it, Sandfall isn't looking to waste the opportunity it has with this first game's success, as it is looking to <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-start-franchise-post-launch-tease/">build out Clair Obscur into a wider franchise</a>. </p>

			<p>Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will be more than simple ports of the original running at a higher resolution, as they will feature some noticeable visual improvements.</p>



<p>In a new video shared online today on YouTube, GVG compared the footage released so far, which includes a five-minute-long uninterrupted gameplay video shared on the official website, detailing some of the unspecified visual improvements confirmed shortly after the collection's <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-launch-on-nintendo-switch-systems-next-month/">announcement.</a> Among these are some significantly improved textures, though not all of them will be enhanced, judging by the footage, improved fonts, and re-rendered cutscenes with a new aspect ratio, which look better even in a comparison based on the compressed footage available. As all the footage has been captured from the Nintendo Switch version running at 1080p resolution, the two games should look even better running at 4K resolution on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides visual improvements, Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will include some new features over the original Wii release and the Super Mario 3D All-Stars port of the first entry in the series. Among these new features will be an Assist Mode to make the games more accessible, the ability to listen to the soundtracks of both games, and more.</p>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will launch ahead of the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">Super Mario Bros. movie</a>, also called Galaxy, on October 2 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
