			<p>PUBG Productions announced that it has launched a new closed beta for its upcoming single-player survival roguelike,<a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/"> Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. This is the fifth playtesting event that PUBG Productions has hosted since the game's reveal in December 2024, with the game due out in early access sometime in summer 2025.</p>
<p>The closed beta will run from today, May 7, to May 14, and is available on Steam and the Epic Games Store. To participate, you need to sign up through the studio's official <a href="https://discord.gg/P3PUCmUV">Discord</a> to receive a code for either storefront. Signing up gets you a code, you don't have to wait to see if you've been accepted into the closed beta. Though, PUBG Productions does stipulate that codes are being given out on a "<em>first-come first-servered basis</em>," so better to be quick if you want to try out Prologue: Go Wayback!.</p>

<p>Even if you do miss this playtest, though, in the PUBG Productions Discord, the team has already confirmed there will be another playtest next month, beginning June 2, 2025. So you'll have another chance, and maybe even another after that, if it ends up releasing in August 2025.</p>
<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/">spoke to PUBG creator Brendan Greene</a> about Prologue: Go Wayback!, Greene outlined his goals for the game as part of a three-game project.</p>
<p>"<em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. it's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a test bed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em>"</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't such a significant update to convince players to return to Starfield. Still, fans of the game are hoping Bethesda can continue improving the sci-fi roleplaying game beyond the Shattered Space expansion that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was released last year</a>. That's what the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> a couple of months ago through social media channels, hinting that 'exciting things' would be added to the game later in 2025. The announcement might come during the Xbox Games Showcase, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set for June 8</a>.</p>

			<p>After a last-minute, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reburn-has-delayed-la-quimera-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight-after-sending-out-review-codes/">quietly confirmed delay</a> on the day of its original intended release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/la-quimera-short-but-not-sweet/">La Quimera</a> has launched on PC in early access a week and a half later.</p>
<p>La Quimera was originally scheduled to release on April 25, 2025, and just days before that release, review keys were sent to members of the press, including Wccftech. When the release day came, shortly after reviews went live, the game was quietly delayed, with developer Reburn releasing a statement just to its Discord server on launch day.</p>
<p>The following day, Reburn posted the same statement to La Quimera's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2282350/discussions/0/597399045152010557/">Steam page</a>, and three days after that, the studio released a longer statement about the delay on the game's Steam page. It was at that point that Reburn confirmed La Quimera would be an early access release after it had originally been marketed as a complete game.</p>
<p>In a press release for today's release, chief executive officer of Reburn, Dmytro Lymar, thanked players who had been keen to play La Quimera for their support after the decision to release La Quimera in early access was announced.</p>
<p>"<em>We truly appreciate the support our community has shown since we made the decision to pivot La Quimera into Early Access. Though this wasn't our original plan, as Ukrainian game developers, we're very familiar with perseverance in the face of tough choices and tougher odds.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Our goal is to deliver a new experience that fans of our past work have come to expect now and through future updates. Thank you again to all of our supporters</em>."</p>
<p>According to the game's Steam page, Reburn intends to work on La Quimera in early access for 18 months, with the full version meant to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeper integration between narrative and gameplay in both solo and co-op modes</li>
<li>Expanded NPC involvement in story-driven gameplay situations</li>
<li>Improved pacing and balance between narrative sequences and gameplay encounters</li>
<li>Enhanced level design for combat, ensuring challenges remain engaging for both solo and cooperative players</li>
<li>A large number of levels that complete the game's major story arcs</li>
</ul>
<p>Reburn also clarified that it intends to raise the game's price from its current early access price of $29.99 USD as it adds more content.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-OBrFTGwWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I was tasked with playing La Quimera for review, and it was apparent from my time with it that it was an unfinished game. I even commented in my review that if it had been marketed as an early access game from the beginning, I would feel better about its current state. But at the time, it was described as a full release, and was simply a broken game that wasn't worth playing.</p>
<p>Now that it has launched in early access, I can't say that I feel better about its chances. I would love to see it improve over the next 18 months and release as the game Reburn first envisioned, but its issues go beyond the numerous technical problems I faced. So many things about La Quimera need not just to improve, but change completely, to come out the other side of early access as a strong, single-player shooter that can stand out in a crowded genre.</p>
<p>It didn't make a good first impression, but La Quimera has the bones of a game that could grow to be a must-play for shooter fans. This is one case where I hope I'm eating my words and the doubts I have now by the time it hits 1.0.</p>
