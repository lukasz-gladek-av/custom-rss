			<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that the first of three story expansions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is out now on all platforms, alongside the game's latest 1.3 update patch, which brings a few quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and a new horse racing feature.</p>
<p>Brushes with Death is the first of three story DLCs that players can jump into if they're looking for more Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and if you bought the Gold Edition of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, or just bought the Expansion Pass separately, then when you update Kingdom Come: Deliverance II on whatever platform you own it on, the Brushes with Death DLC will be a part of that update.</p>
<p>If you just bought the base game, then you'll be able to pick up Brushes with Death individually for $5.99 USD.</p>

<p>Just last week, Warhorse Studios announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/">Kingdom Come series had surpassed 13 million copies sold</a>, with the first game breaking 10 million, and its recently released sequel surpassing 3 million copies sold.&nbsp;It's a massive milestone for Warhorse, who can easily be regarded as one of the best makers of open-world games.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,</a> our reviewer, Chris Wray, didn't have enough nice things to say about the game, saying that it is "<em>a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-officially-announces-stellar-blade-pc-release-date-pc-specs-revealed/">Stellar Blade</a> will be out on PC in a little less than a month at this time of writing, and after it was officially announced today, pre-orders went live on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>However, players who were eager to pre-order it were met with <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-blocked-in-130-countries-devs-apparently-werent-aware.1190337/">disappointment</a> and the message that the game was unavailable in their countries. An issue that no one expected, not even the game's developer, Shift Up, <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923052833101709517">who confirmed in a post on X,</a> responding to an upset fan, that the game does not require a PSN account to play it on PC.</p>
<p>And yet, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1294088/info/">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade is marked as unavailable in <strong>130 countries</strong>, just like every other PlayStation-published game on Steam.</p>
<p>Requiring a PSN account to play PlayStation games on Steam is an issue that blew up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-no-longer-purchasable-steam-refunds/">Helldivers 2</a>, and while <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/">Sony did end up relenting in that case</a>, how it handled that whole saga, and every other PC release for PlayStation games, made it clear that PSN account sign-in is something PlayStation and Sony want in all of its PC releases.</p>
<p>Which is what makes this case all the more upsetting, because PlayStation is seemingly punishing players who live in countries where PSN isn't officially available.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there's been no official word from PlayStation on the issue, and based on the few replies the official Stellar Blade X account has given players bringing the issue to them, it seems like Shift Up has been blindsided by this. Hopefully, we'll learn more soon and will update this article as more on this comes to light.</p>
