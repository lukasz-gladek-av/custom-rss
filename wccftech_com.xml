			<p>Some may not remember it well now, but No Man's Sky had an utterly disastrous launch back in August 2016. After much hype, the released game proved quite disappointing to critics and fans alike. The Metascore average for the PC version is still <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/no-mans-sky/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sitting at just 61/100</a> (which is labeled as 'Mixed or Average' on Metacritic), and fans were also quite critical in their user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>One month after the game's debut, No Man's Sky was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/mans-sky-investigation-uks-advertising-standards-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigated</a> by the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority after many complaints from British customers. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-steam-page-not-mislead-consumers-asa-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared</a> of any wrongdoings on that count a few months later, but the mixed reception lingered.</p>
<p>Still, independent developer Hello Games embarked on a journey to deliver their true vision for the game. Year after year, they delivered dozens of major free updates, adding new features, content, and improvements in all areas, slowly winning back the respect and even admiration of gamers worldwide. In September 2021, five years after that fateful launch, No Man's Sky's overall user review score <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-has-finally-reached-mostly-positive-70-overall-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned</a> from 'Mixed' to 'Mostly Positive'.</p>
<p>Now, the game has reached another milestone, having finally moved from 'Mostly Positive' to 'Very Positive'. Game director Sean Murray, who also manages the official social media channels, <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1861859832187211963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X:</p>
<p><em>Holy shit you guys - it happened ü•≥</em></p>
<p><em>ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive üòç</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you Thank you Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è</em></p>
<p><em>You have no idea what this means to us üôè</em></p>
<p>It must feel good to have come this far after that debut. There is little doubt that it's one of the most epic comebacks in the history of gaming, arguably alongside Square Enix's Final Fantasy XIV and CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>The most important thing, though, is that Hello Games has earned back the love of its fans, who continue to play No Man's Sky in ever greater numbers after every new update. The last one <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> the long-awaited cross-save progression feature and also brought back Mass Effect's Normandy to celebrate N7 Day. The studio's engineers also impressed once again with their PS5 Pro implementation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> a stable 8K resolution mode at 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>While No Man's Sky continues to be updated at an impressive pace, following the incredible recovery of the game, fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-handily-tops-youtube-views-for-tga-2023-trailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also very eager</a> to discover more about the studio's next title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire</a>. This fantasy-themed game promises to be every bit as ambitious as the previous game, given the studio's goal to deliver a true planet-sized multiplayer sandbox roleplaying game.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends as a beginner, you'll see that there are <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five roles</a> to choose from. This includes ADC, Support, Jungler, Top and Mid. This guide will be walking you through some of the easiest Mid laners that you can play in League of Legends as a beginner. Being a Mid laner can be pretty daunting, as you are the most vulnerable lane out of the three. You have the possibility to be attacked from either side, whether it be laners or the jungler.</p>
<p>Check out our other League of Legends guides here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">Best ADCS for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/">Best Supports for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Junglers for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-top-laners-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Top laners for beginners&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Mid Laners for Beginners in League of Legends</h2>
<p><span><strong>Veigar</strong> is, of course, on the list. As long as you stack his Q against minions or even against champions, you'll get stacks and more damage very quickly. He also has great crowd control, as he has the potential to stun enemies with his E. Depending on how well you farm, Veigar has the potential to snowball and be a real threat, allowing him to one-shot enemies with his Ultimate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lux</strong> is another great mage to play and is one of the easiest champions to learn how to play. She is quite versatile and can also be played as a support. Compared to other champions, Lux has a relatively low cooldown on her Ultimate, making her a nightmare for the enemy team. However, she can be a bit difficult as both her Q and her Ultimate are skill shots that have the potential to miss.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Malzahar</strong> is a ton of fun, and once you get the farming technique down pat using his DoT, you have a lot of potential to earn plenty of gold and get the advantage over your opponent. His voidlings are great distractions, and he has some great crowd control. Once his damage has ramped up, his Ultimate can be a real threat, as it stuns the enemy and saps their health.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Annie</strong> is a great mid laner to learn if you're just getting started in League of Legends. Her abilities are easy to use, and her damage is simple and efficient. As long as you make sure to stack your shield properly so that your ability stuns, you have the potential to wipe out many opponents, especially if you use your stun-infused ability to summon Tibbers on top of the enemy.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the easiest Mid laners you can learn to play, and they are a ton of fun to play, too. They have a lot of potential to make you the team carry as long as you learn their kits.</p>
<p>Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wolfire and Dark Catt‚Äôs Antitrust Lawsuit Against Valve Given Class Action Status]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolfire-and-dark-catt%E2%80%99s-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status.1047639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The legal dispute between Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios against Valve first started in 2021 and has since been granted class-action status. This was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-granted-class-action-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, where they stated that they saw a court document that shows the motion for class certification to be granted. United States District Judge Jamal N. Whitehead granted the motion. By doing this, it means that the antitrust lawsuit that was started by Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios now has the potential to become a significantly larger dispute.</p>
<p>Wolfire first <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-founder-gabe-newell-ordered-to-ensure-in-court-presence-amid-steam-anti-trust-lawsuit/">filed the lawsuit in April 2021</a>, claiming that Valve's commission is "an extraordinarily high cut," constituting anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit also argues that Valve uses its dominance to "exploit publishers and consumers." However, this claim was actually dismissed in November 2021. Once that happened, the developer decided to reevaluate, update, and adapt their arguments in May 2022. As this happened, VR game developer Dark Catt Studios also filed its own antitrust lawsuit in June 2021. Some of the claims they made were dismissed, but they were allowed to continue the lawsuit based on some of their claims that were found to have validity.</p>
<p>Since the lawsuits were so similar, a court order was then issued in July 2022 to confirm that both cases would be consolidated into one.</p>
<p>The document says that the class action will apply to any developers, publishers, or individuals who paid a commission to Valve in connection with a game sale. The class action refers to the 30% cut the firm takes from each purchase. The class action will be referring to the people on or after January 28, 2017.</p>
<p>Valve is not the only one who has been involved in a lawsuit for similar problems as of late. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-and-sony-sued-for-establishing-digital-monopolies-with-their-stores/">Sony is also involved in a class action lawsuit</a>, as they removed the ability for retailers like Amazon, GameStop, or Best Buy to directly sell digital codes for PlayStation games. This led to a feeling that Sony was monopolizing the titles, and causing consumers to have to pay higher prices than they could have at an alternative retailer.</p>
<p>In the order, the judge has made the decision to deny Valve's request to exclude the testimony of an expert. This expert is Dr. Steven Schwartz, who has called both studios to argue their case for them. In this case, Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt will both be the class representatives for the action.</p>
<p>At the moment, there's no telling how long this class action will take, as the class action for Sony isn't due to appear in court for a couple of years.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends, you'll find that there are <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five roles</a> to choose from in the game, all of which have different priorities. Top lane may be a little bit daunting, as you are the sole person in the lane and are responsible for everything that happens up there. However, there is a lot of fun to be had and a ton of potential to snowball and end up being the team carry. For those wanting to experiment with the top lane, here are some of the best top laners for beginners.</p>
<p>Check out our other League of Legends guides:</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/">Best Supports</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">Best ADCS</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Junglers</a></p>
<h2>Best Top Laners for Beginners in League of Legends</h2>
<p>There are a ton of top laners out there, with more being added all the time. However, some are significantly easier than others to play and can help you get to grips with the functionality of the lane.</p>
<p>One of the easiest top laners to try out is&nbsp;<strong>Nasus.</strong> He's been a mainstay in the game since its release and has one of the easiest kits to use. You just have to make sure that you are executing minions with your Q, and your damage will start to ramp up very fast. You also have the ability to slow your opponents significantly, making a chase much easier, especially if your jungler is ganking you. On top of that, if you are the one being chased, using your slow can also make it much easier for you to get away in sticky situations. Your Ultimate is excellent, as it makes you much bigger with a bigger health bar and makes it much harder to kill you. This is great if you're in a sticky situation or if you find yourself in a large team fight.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Darius</strong> is another typical top laner that you'll see in lane. He can be a massive pain to deal with, which makes it a great idea to learn him early on. Darius' abilities center around bleed damage, which can allow you to get some great early-game kills on opponents, especially if they are relatively squishy. It can be a bit tricky learning the rotation of his moveset, but once you've gotten the hang of it, Darius can make the opponent's life a misery.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Garen</strong> is another mainstay in League of Legends, and was one of the first champions to be released when the game came out. His moveset is very simple and is one of the easiest top laners to learn in League of Legends if you're a beginner. If you manage to get kills early on, you can snowball quickly and become a carry for the team, especially in team fights.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While&nbsp;<strong>Maokai</strong> isn't typically a top laner, he is currently very viable in the top lane thanks to the current meta. He's very versatile and works in both the mid lane and bot lane as a support. Roaming with Maokai is always a great decision and is a great damage sponge. As a result, he makes a great frontline if you're in a team fight, as he can protect the squishier champions, as well as root enemies using his Ultimate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are many other great top laners out there in League of Legends, all ranging in difficulty. Have fun experimenting, and good luck in the Summoner's Rift.</p>
