			<p>It seems like Hogwarts Legacy 2 won't be a live service game after all. At least, that's what Jason Schreier said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the latest Kinda Funny Gamescast episode</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><em>A lot of people have talked about how in recent years people like Zaslav and JB Perrette are talking all about games as a service, but the games as a service mandate started long before that. This is more executives just saying what shareholders want to hear, because if you look at their current slate of games, they're not games as a service. Hogwarts Legacy 2 is not going to be a game as a service, the new Batman from Rocksteady is not going to be a game as a service, and even Wonder Woman wasn't going to be a game as a service. This is not a company that is going all in on games as a service. They're going all in on those big franchises.</em></p>
<p><em>I think they still believe that there's room for success. I've talked to executives there who envision a world where you would be playing in Hogwarts with your friends and you go hang out with your buddies, you're all wizards together and taking classes together. They have these kind of fantasies in their heads about games as a service that might work. It's just that these particular projects that are currently in development - I'm sure they have a game of service at some point somewhere, but those are not them.</em></p>
<p>That is quite surprising, considering that less than a year ago, JB Perrette (CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games at Warner Bros. Discovery) <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>Rather than just launching a one-and-done console game, how do develop a game around, for example, Hogwarts Legacy that is a live service where people can live and build and play in that world on an ongoing basis?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it is simply the case that this executive vision didn't quite align with what Avalanche Software felt they could deliver with Hogwarts Legacy 2, effectively postponing the publisher's dream of a live service game in Harry Potter's universe.</p>
<p>Anyway, Schreier also doubled down on the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that there is a Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition in the works between Rocksteady and Avalanche Software featuring new 'DLC'. It is unclear whether this DLC will be exclusive to the new edition or separately purchasable for owners of the existing game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you want more Hogwarts Legacy content, there's the new official modding tools and mod support <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-pc-gets-modding-tool-and-built-in-support-on-january-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in late January for PC</a>.</p>

			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monolith Productions' official closure</a>, renowned journalist Jason Schreier shared more details about what the studio had been working on since the 2017 launch of Middle-earth: Shadow of War.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, Schreier revealed that Monolith did not want to make another game in the 'Middle-earth: Shadow of' universe. That is understandable, as by Shadow of War, the formula had become rather stale. The developer attempted to create an original IP codenamed Legacy next, but Warner Bros. Games decided to cancel the project in April 2021. This proved to be a fatal blow for Monolith because most of the leadership team resigned and went on to found <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cliffhanger Games</a>, an Electronic Arts-owned developer that is developing <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Black Panther game</a>. Interestingly, this new game will feature 'new storytelling tech' that will be used across several EA games, sounding a lot like the Nemesis system developed at Monolith. That one is trademarked by Warner Bros. Games, but some of the former developers could have developed a similar concept without incurring legal problems.</p>
<p>Anyway, Monolith tried to make the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman game</a> powered by the Nemesis system. However, the studio had to rebuild its leadership team from scratch in the middle of this new project, and they were also unsure whether to use Unreal Engine or their own LithTech Firebird engine. The latter ultimately won out, but several of the engineers who were experienced with it had left the company by then, causing development problems.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Wonder Woman was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-game-was-rebooted-last-year-rocksteady-is-going-back-to-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> between late 2023 and early 2024. The new version was supposed to be more like God of War and no longer have the Nemesis system. Clearly, though, a lot of work was left to do before the game could ship, and Warner Bros. Games decided to cut their losses and shut down Monolith for good. As is often the case in these situations, the developers only learned about the dire news on the same day as the public.</p>
<p>Regarding the rest of Warner Bros. Games, some executives reportedly wanted to transform WB Games Montreal into a support studio after the release of Gotham Knights, and some of the team was put on helping Monolith with Wonder Woman until recently. However, the developer of Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights is still trying to pitch a Game of Thrones title, and the IP based on George R.R. Martin's world was named among the publisher's priorities going forward. According to Schreier, TT Games is also in the final steps of making a new LEGO game that could launch as early as next year.</p>
