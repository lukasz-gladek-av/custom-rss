			<p>Following the release of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</strong></a>, Owlcat Games will soon return to the universe created by Games Workshop with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</strong></a>, a game that is set to surpass its predecessor in many different ways while improving the player experience with some choice tweaks. Today, the development team has provided a new look at some of the game's standout features ahead of the launch of the Alpha version later this month.</p>



<p>Today's new screenshots, which can be found below, provide a new look at the party members, the detailed environments, combat sequences, and the first look at the mind map powering the detective gameplay, which I found to be among the most interesting additions to the experience when I had the chance of seeing the game in action during this year's Gamescom.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the new batch of Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy precedes the launch of the game's Alpha version, which will debut on December 16 on Steam. This early version of the game allows players to test out some of the game's features, including the tactical turn-based combat system and the investigative features that suit the Inquisitor protagonist well, while helping Owlcat with the game's development.</p>



<p>Although it may not look that much different from its predecessor at a glance, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy packs a lot of improvements and new features that will set the two games apart. Combat, in particular, has been significantly enhanced, with an overhaul of the cover system and a new targeting system that opens up numerous tactical options.

			<p>As far as worst-kept video game industry secrets for 2025 go, the top two would arguably be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/">Leon Kennedy being in Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Ubisoft's upcoming remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>. After the former had a major leak, which practically confirmed what has long been suspected, the latter has matched it with a leak of its own, as a PEGI rating for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted online.</p>



<p>Initially spotted by <a href="https://x.com/CorkbenYT/status/1998396558027440489">X (formerly Twitter) user and YouTuber CorkbenYT</a>, the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced">PEGI 18 rating on the official PEGI website is listed as from Ubisoft EMEA</a>. It appears that the "<em>Resynced</em>" subtitle is Ubisoft's play on 'remake' or 'remastered,' and could likely be the new official title for the upcoming remakes that <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot confirmed the company would be doing back in June 2024</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To be clear, while Guillemot confirmed that players can expect to see remakes of older Assassin's Creed titles from Ubisoft, no individual remake has yet been confirmed, though we've had several rumours that the remakes would start with Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. </p>



<p>Just last month, a new rumour pointed to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Black Flag remake arriving sometime in March 2026</a>, which would put it just ahead of Ubisoft's new fiscal year, and it would also mean that unless Ubisoft is looking to shadow-drop this remake, it would be announcing it fairly soon.</p>



<p>That announcement could come <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">during The Game Awards later this week</a>, or, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/">Ubisoft opted to skip 2025 with its Ubisoft Forward event</a>, we could see that event return in the beginning of 2026 with an event in January or February to announce the remake's arrival in March.</p>



<p>At this point, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/">after this year's rumours</a>, rumours <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">from previous years</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">comments from Edward Kenway's voice actor</a>, the remake is all but confirmed to be coming. All that's left is for Ubisoft to show it off, and hopefully it does so soon.</p>
