			<p><strong>GameStop</strong>, the largest retailer dedicated to videogames, is reportedly <strong>shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</strong>. </p>



<p>The reports started appearing on social media and were quickly conflated into one very long list on the '<a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop Closing List'</a> blog, which reckons there are at least <strong>410 GameStop stores confirmed to be closing</strong> and another 11 reported but as of yet unconfirmed.</p>



<p>This is only the latest round of closures for the retailer headquartered in Grapevine, Texas. In the annual 10-K SEC filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000162828025014731/gme-20250201.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued in February 2025</a>, the company stated:</p>



<p><em>We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.</em></p>



<p>The employees being let go are understandably furious, especially since the latest wave of cuts occurred shortly after another SEC filing was issued this Wednesday, January 7, when GameStop <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638026000004/pressrelease-rclti.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a massive performance-based stock option for its current CEO, <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong>. Cohen, who assumed the role on September 28, 2023, is the largest individual shareholder and stands to gain up to <strong>$35 billion</strong> (yes, you read that right), albeit with a massive caveat: the company’s market capitalization would have to grow to $100 billion and the company would need to achieve $10 billion in Cumulative Performance EBITDA.</p>



<p>Considering that GameStop's current market <span>capitalization as of yesterday's closing was&nbsp;<strong>$9.51 billion</strong>, Cohen would have to somehow stage a 10-fold market capitalization</span> growth to receive his full bonus. Granted, there is a precedent: in January 2021, a short squeeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused the company's stock to </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank">surge significantly</a>, briefly reaching an</span> astounding pre-market value of <strong>$500 per share</strong> on January 28, almost thirty times the share's valuation earlier that month. Even then, though, the market cap only reached $33.7 billion, still quite far from that $100 billion threshold required by Cohen's bonus. And with the constant shift toward digital games, it's hard to imagine how the company could achieve such a high valuation. </p>



<p>There are, however, nine vesting tranches, the first of which is definitely more achievable for the executive.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Tranche</strong></td><td><strong>% of Award</strong></td><td><strong>Market Cap Hurdle</strong></td><td><strong>Cumulative Performance EBITDA Hurdle</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>10%</td><td>$20 Billion</td><td>$2.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10%</td><td>$30 Billion</td><td>$3.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>10%</td><td>$40 Billion</td><td>$4.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>10%</td><td>$50 Billion</td><td>$5.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>10%</td><td>$60 Billion</td><td>$6.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>10%</td><td>$70 Billion</td><td>$7.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>10%</td><td>$80 Billion</td><td>$8.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>15%</td><td>$90 Billion</td><td>$9.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>15%</td><td>$100 Billion</td><td>$10.0 Billion</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By the way, GameStop is also restructuring its operations in other countries. They sold their Italian operations, closed down in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria, and shared their intent to sell the Canadian branch. Now, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to RNZ</a>, they might be looking to close in New Zealand, too, although the proposal is apparently 'not final'. They currently have 38 stores there.</p>
