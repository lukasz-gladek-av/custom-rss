			<p>If you're getting stuck into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard and want to know who you can romance ahead of time, this guide will tell you everything you need to know. In total, there are six characters you can romance, and a lot of the time, being able to bump up your relationship with them involves completing <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/">certain quests</a>, picking specific dialog options, and the like. It functions the same way it does in most games, where you can romance a companion. This guide will tell you about each character you can romance and some of the best ways to win their favor.</p>
<h2>All Romance Options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>As stated above, there are&nbsp;<strong>six characters</strong> that you can romance. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harding</li>
<li>Neve</li>
<li>Bellara</li>
<li>Davrin</li>
<li>Emmrich</li>
<li>Taash</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to romance the characters, you'll want to make sure that you are checking the&nbsp;<strong>Lighthouse</strong> frequently. This is a hub that shows which characters you can interact with, and this will give you an opportunity to have conversations with them, which can also lead to progress in your bond with them. As you progress your relationship with the companion, you'll also be given the option to take on their personal quests. If you complete them, it also has the option to provide additional context and conversations where you are able to flirt with them.</p>
<p>Should you be undecided on who to romance, you are given the option to flirt with all of the companions for a time until you reach a point in a relationship with one of them where they ask for commitment. Then, it's up to you to decide your next move.</p>
<p>In addition to having conversations with the companions, completing any quest will boost your relationship with the companions that are in your party. If you're trying to romance someone specific, it's generally recommended that you keep them in your party throughout the game to be able to boost their relationship as you go. While quests provide approval boosts with your companions, completing faction-specific quests can also grant approval boosts to the companions in those specific factions.</p>
<p>As an example, if you're fighting off Venatori enemies in Dock Town, this will increase your relationship with Neve but will not increase your relationship with the other companions available.</p>
<p>It's also possible for specific companions to romance each other. It's uncertain at the moment whether it's based on who you pick or if it's just guaranteed to end up that way, but there is the possibility of seeing some of your friends romance each other.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about all of the romance options in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Who will you be romancing first?</p>
