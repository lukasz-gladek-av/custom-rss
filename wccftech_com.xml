			<p>If you're looking for some scares to see you into the new year, there are plenty of great ones scattered throughout the next 12 months. Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saw some fantastic horror games</a>, but this year also has a ton of potential if you're looking for multiplayer horror or single-player horror experiences.</p>
<p>Here's our shortlist for the five most anticipated horror games of 2025. All of them will be available on all main platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), and they also share the trait of not having a fixed launch date yet.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a></em></p>

<h2>Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a bit more of a horror game compared to the survival elements of the previous iterations in the franchise. While they, too, had a slight horror vibe, it seems to be more of a focus in this game. You follow the story of Kyle Crane, who returns from the first entry, and the experiments that he underwent, which gave him significant strength and power. However, it comes at a cost. You have to work to keep the remaining survivors of Castor Woods safe while keeping your powers in check. While the signature parkour is still here, the ability to drive vehicles also returns from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Following</a>. Read <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our interview from Gamescom 2024</a> to learn even more about this standalone game.</p>

<h2>Cronos: The New Dawn</h2>
<p>This is the latest game from Bloober Team, a previously controversial developer <span>who became a superstar after the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. According to the Polish developers, it is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by the survival mechanics of Resident Evil and Dead Space</span>. The story will see players traveling between past and future: in the past, they'll experience a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that has changed humanity forever. In the future, which has become a ravaged wasteland, they'll fight for survival against dangerous abominations.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the protagonist is a time traveler, an agent for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of specific time rifts that will transport them back to 1980s Poland. In the past, the mission is to locate key figures who perished in The Change, save them, and bring them into the future to change it.</p>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p>Little Nightmares is a beloved franchise in the horror games community, and it's not hard to see why. On the surface level, it seems like a cutesy little puzzle game with horror sprinkled in, but it often tells a much more horrifying story in character design and environments. <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>, which was originally scheduled to launch in 2024, is the next game in the series and brings optional (you can also play with the AI) co-op multiplayer to the franchise, which is a massive step for the Little Nightmares games. We can only hope it won't be as damaging as it was for Dead Space, which also added co-op with its third installment.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020</h2>
<p>For the most part, you can't go wrong with games in The Dark Pictures Anthology. The last game in The Dark Pictures Anthology was the spin-off VR-exclusive game named <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-dark-pictures-switchback-vr-qa-supermassive-talks-utilizing-ps-vr2s-fantastic-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switchback</a>. However, this is the first game in the second and final season of the horror series created by Supermassive Games.</p>
<p>The game stars actress Lashana Lynch as Brianna Young, an astronaut and pilot of a colony ship called Cassiopeia, which crash-lands on Tau Ceti f, a planet 12 light-years away, after setting out to find a new home to save humanity as Earth is dying. The game's creative director has described it as "The Thing in deep space," which is certainly an intriguing premise as far as horror games go.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Tormented Souls 2</h2>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tormented-souls-replicating-classics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tormented Souls</a> was a rather brilliant survival horror game for a first outing, and it is now getting a sequel. In this game, you reprise the role of Caroline Walker and get to explore brand-new horrifying locations that promise to keep you on edge the entire time. After the events of the first game, Caroline longs for a normal life with her younger sister, Anna. However, Anna suddenly falls ill due to a mysterious affliction against which conventional remedies prove futile. In a desperate attempt to save her sister, Caroline must turn to the supernatural again, heading to the remote and sinister Southern American town of Puerto Miller, where she'll be forced to explore eerie monasteries and other nightmarish locations to discover how to help Anna.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 6 SoC is Design Complete and In Pre-Si Validation Phase; GPU is an Early Fork of Gfx13 – Rumor]]></title>

			<p>Work on the PlayStation 6 seems to be in a much more advanced stage than most people thought, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF Forums, well-known AMD leaker Kepler L2 commented on the next-generation system from Sony, revealing that its SoC is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design complete</a> and is currently in pre-silicon validation already, with A0 tapeout scheduled for late this year. While this may mean little to most, this new information suggests that the console may not be too far from release, as Sony's usual cadence between A0 tapeout and the release of a system is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270023151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 years</a>, meaning that, if this will be the same for the PlayStation 6, we could see the launch of the system in 2027.</p>
<p>The AMD leaker also provided some additional information on the PlayStation 6 GPU, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> it is a fork of AMD gfx13, which was formerly known as RDNA 5 and is now known as UDNA. The leaker couldn't say how big it will be, but the fact that it will belong to the gfx13 will eventually provide some information on some of its features once AMD fully unveils the architecture.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the PlayStation 6 as of now besides the fact that it will once again be powered by AMD. This was revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a> in a report which confirmed that Intel lost the bid to produce the console to AMD due to a dispute over how much profit Intel would make from each chip sold to Sony which prevented the company from settling on a price.</p>
