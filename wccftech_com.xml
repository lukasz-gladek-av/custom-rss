			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro features a major repairability improvement that is usually not found in video game consoles.</p>
<p>Judging from a <a href="https://imgur.com/FvyBYhI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picture</a> of the system that's been making the rounds, the soon-to-be-released console features a slot that grants quick access to the CMOS battery. This battery is an extremely important component of gaming systems, as it powers the CMOS chip that stores important hardware information and may prevent a system from functioning properly, as was the case for the PlayStation 4 before Sony issued an update to fix the issues related to a bad or missing CMOS battery.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't be long before we learn more about the PlayStation 5 Pro, as the system launches next week worldwide and has already reached stores. Earlier this week, the console also got into the hands of the press and influencers, and, not being able to talk about the system just yet, some of them got rather creative and decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-review-box/">review the box</a>, which is a markedly "PlayStation" box. Developers are also ready for the system's release, launching <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-playstation-5-pro-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro patches</a> to allow their games to take advantage of the console's increased power and features, such as PSSR.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

			<p>The PC version of GTA Online will be updated sometime next year with features introduced in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/k4479kk2k9ak2a/gta-online-community-update?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=gtao_announcement_community-update-20241101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> shared online today outlining what's coming to the game in the next few weeks, Rockstar Games confirmed there are plans to bring the much-requested PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X features of the game to the PC version next year. These features include ray tracing support, texture and draw distance upgrades, increased population and traffic variety, increased vegetation density, improved lighting quality across shadows, water reflections, enhanced anti-aliasing and motion blur, improved explosions and fire, and more.</p>
<p>With GTA VI coming next year, it will be very interesting to see how Rockstar Games will handle GTA Online. Still, for the time being, it seems like updates and new content won't stop coming anytime soon, with more coming this December and beyond. The game's continued support is hardly surprising, considering it's still extremely popular, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/">last month</a>, over 400,000 players logged into the game to play the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival Mode.</p>
<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>
