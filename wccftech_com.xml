			<p>Ubisoft wasn't a part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> in the traditional way, with its own<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/"> Ubisoft Forward</a> presentation taking place at some point within the already jam-packed weekend, but it did appear in some SGF 2025 events with a couple of release date announcements and the reveal of a brand new game.</p>
<p>Starting with the release date reveal, we now know that Anno 117: Pax Romana will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 13, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>The new release date trailer for Anno 117 showed off a bit more gameplay and plenty of glamor shots of the game, though if you want a dedicated gameplay deep-dive, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-gets-first-gameplay-showcase/">can check out the previous trailer Ubisoft showed off.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Official Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6a37J87bew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up was The Rogue Prince of Persia, a 2D-platforming Prince of Persia game from Evil Empire that released in early access last year. Unfortunately, we didn't get an exact release date, but we did get a release window for the 1.0 update, which is due to arrive sometime in <strong>August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the game has evolved since its early access release, which was already a strong foundation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo regarded its early access launch highly, writing</a>, "<em>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="PC Gaming Show Trailer - The Rogue Prince of Persia" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9c1QFum8GXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Ubisoft revealed a new title it is publishing from developer Screen Juice, called Morbid Metal. It's a new hack-and-slash roguelite with semi-procedurally generated levels, set in what appears to be some kind of dystopian future. It's due to arrive on PC in early access on&nbsp;<strong>August 20, 2025,</strong> and will feature three playable characters at launch that'll each have their own unique playstyles.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866130/Morbid_Metal/">demo you can play on Steam right now</a>, if you're keen to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Morbid Metal - Gameplay Trailer - PC Gaming Show" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YL9ArylnvzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>None of these were exactly the announcements players had expected from Ubisoft during the Summer Game Fest weekend. There was nothing about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/">Splinter Cell,</a> or any of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/">Assassin's Creed</a> games currently in development. There wasn't even a last-ditch push for <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, the biggest change to Siege in the game's history, which launches tomorrow at the time of this writing. There was also no mention of what's next for <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/">Far Cry</a>, or the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>With 2025 officially lacking a Ubisoft Forward event, it's unlikely we'll hear about any of those titles and series the rest of the year, unless the company decides to drop news for its biggest franchises in a third-party show like Gamescom ONL or The Game Awards. The company is going through <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">several major changes</a>, so it's not surprising that it doesn't have very much to showcase at the moment, but a muted 2025 does not bode well for the company after its extremely disappointing 2024.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's PC Gaming Show 2025, Aspyr Media unveiled Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition, the definitive version of 2002's classic roleplaying game made by Obsidian Entertainment.</p>
<p>Aspyr Media promised smoother gameplay with refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI. Indeed, the game is coming to consoles for the first time (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch), although it's also available on PC (Steam and GOG), of course. Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition will debut on all these platforms on July 15 for $29.99, but a 10% discount is available until launch.</p>
<p>The game supports crossplay between all platforms when in co-op multiplayer mode (up to four players). Moreover, this version includes the base game and the three expansions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mask of the Betrayer:</strong> Cursed with an insatiable hunger only quelled by devouring spirits, the Shard-Bearer must travel to the Shadow Realm to unearth the cause of this dark affliction.</li>
<li><strong>Storm of Zehir:</strong> You and your crew are shipwrecked on the shores of a hostile jungle nation. Fighting your way back to civilization, you uncover a plot threatening to change Faerûn forever.</li>
<li><strong>Mysteries of Westgate:</strong> Beware the city of Westgate, where anything goes and everything has a price. Explore and expose the secrets hidden deep in the city’s underbelly before they consume you.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wO0yHwBETE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition also fully supports Steam Workshop, providing access to a wealth of adventures and modules. Moreover, this version still allows the player to become a Dungeon Master and craft their own adventures to share with other players. The original game was renowned for its deep but complex modding tools.</p>
<p>If you want to go all-in on the series, there's also a&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/53494/Neverwinter_Nights_1__2_Enhanced_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neverwinter Nights 1 + 2 Enhanced Collection</a> that includes the previously released <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition</a>.</p>
