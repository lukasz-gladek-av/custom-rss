			<p>The recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</a> expansion will continuously deliver exclusive content to owners throughout the coming season. The news was confirmed by Blizzard Diablo Franchise Manager Rod Fergusson in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/480711/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-new-exclusive-season-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p><em>Because we know that the beginning of a season is sort of a fresh starting point, we wanted to launch the expansion at the same time as the beginning of a season. That’s why we launched at the beginning of season 6, so you could roll a Spiritborn as your new thing. So it can feel like a little bit like this expansion is just a single moment in time, and I just wanted to highlight that that’s not the case. We’re going to continue to develop features that will be, essentially, exclusive to Vessel of Hatred owners. As we continue chapter two, as a Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred owner, you’ll get access to other stuff in chapter two as part of your ownership. So we’re going to continue to have Vessel of Hatred be valuable beyond season 6 as well.</em></p>
<p>This actually began with the launch of Vessel of Hatred. Runewords are, so far, exclusive to owners of the expansion, and more Runewords will be added with Season 7. As we reported last week, Patch 2.1 will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> on the Public Test Realm, delivering the long-awaited Armory feature, brand new Witch-like powers, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Diablo IV is currently enjoying a free trial for both the expansion and the main game itself, up to level 25. On this subject, Fergusson explained:</p>
<p><em>We were looking at ways of creating a boost for players to be able to say, Hey, welcome back, Eternal player. Maybe you haven’t played in a while. Let’s get you cleaned up. Let’s give you a shave and haircut here. So you don’t have to do all the 'I got to spend two hours just cleaning up before I can go and play'. In the last 18 months, so much has changed. But if you’re an Eternal player who played the campaign and then stopped, you don’t know. You haven’t felt this 18 months of evolution.</em></p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler fares fairly well in The Last of Us Part 1, although it is inferior to both AMD FSR 2 and NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> provided an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro update released for the remake of the first entry in the series, also providing a comparison between the AI-powered upscaler featured in the mid-generation system, AMD FSR 2, and NVIDIA DLSS. For comparison, the PC version was running with similar graphics settings, and sharpening was set at the lowest for both FSR 2 and DLSS, as PSSR seems to not use post-process sharpening.</p>
<p>Compared to AMD FSR 2, the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler shows once again how it delivers a slightly better image in motion, as FSR 2 aliases foliage and fine geometry more. Still, PSSR features some image noise that FSR 2 doesn't, so the two upscalers are pretty much equivalent in The Last of Us Part 1, although FSR 2 delivers a sharper, more stable image than PSSR with the camera at rest.</p>
<p>As we have already seen in other games, NVIDIA DLSS is clearly superior to the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler in the vast majority of scenarios, delivering a basically faultless image quality at rest while looking very smooth in motion, even in Performance mode. PSSR, on the other hand, manages to maintain image detail in motion better than NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how the new Sony upscaler has the potential to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">much better in the future</a>.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the features that make the PlayStation 5 Pro a better system than the base model. You can learn more about them in our review.</p>
