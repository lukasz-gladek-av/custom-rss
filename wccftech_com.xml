			<p>SAG-AFTRA members under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA), the contract under which video game companies hire voice actors for their games have overwhelmingly voted to approve the new version of the contract that had been negotiated for the last three years, officially bringing an end to the strike that began in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">July 2024</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-video-game-agreement">SAG-AFTRA announced</a> that the deal, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-reaches-tentative-deal-with-video-game-companies-voice-actors-strike-might-be-coming-to-an-end/">tentatively reached last month</a> and marked a suspension of the strike, was approved after 95.04% of members voted 'Yes' to ratifying the deal, with only 4.96% of members voting 'No.'</p>



<p>The core issue that kept negotiations going for so long, and that kicked off the strike, revolved around generative AI tools and actors wanting to ensure they would be protected against video game companies abusing the technology to use actors' voices and likenesses without properly compensating the actors and without the actors' consent. This new deal includes a pay raise for actors, but more significantly, it includes the protections that SAG-AFTRA members and contract negotiators were hoping to achieve.</p>



<p>"<em>The new contract also accomplishes performer safety guardrails and gains around A.I., including consent and disclosure requirements for A.I. digital replica use and the ability for performers to suspend consent for generation of new material during a strike</em>," SAG-AFTRA's statement on the deals ratification reads. </p>



<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said on the deal's approval, "<em>I commend the strong leadership of Interactive Media Agreement negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh, who remained steadfast through three years of hard bargaining while facing many challenging headwinds during a challenging negotiating cycle. This deal achieves important progress around A.I. protections, and progress is the name of the game! My sincere respect goes out to the entire video game performer community and their allies for their solidarity during the strike which provided the necessary leverage to secure this deal's many essential gains</em>."</p>



<p>Chief negotiator and SAG-AFTRA national executive director, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added, "<em>All of us at SAG-AFTRA would like to extend our deepest appreciation to the video game performers and allies who endured a great deal of sacrifice through the 11-month strike. I'd also like to express my sincerest gratitude to the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee, and its chair, Sarah Elmaleh, who have worked tirelessly for nearly three years in order to achieve these necessary gains and protections alongside our negotiating staff and lead negotiator Ray Rodriguez.</em>"</p>



<p>For the part of the video game companies like Take-Two, Activision, PlayStation, EA, and more on the other side of the aisle, spokesperson Audrey Cooling said, "<em>We are pleased that SAG-AFTRA members have ratified a new Interactive Media Agreement, which delivers historic wage increases, industry-leading A.I. protections, and enhanced health and safety measures for performers. We look forward to building on our industry's decades-long partnership with the union and continuing to create groundbreaking entertainment experiences for billions of players worldwide.</em>"</p>



<p>Now that the agreement has been ratified, actors under the IMA won't have to worry about another potential strike or negotiating period for at least a few years.  The conclusion of the strike also means that we won't have to see any games delayed due to companies not being able to hire actors to cast in their games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Is Ending Online Support For Need For Speed: Rivals In October 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-endings-need-for-speed-rivals-online-support-october-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-is-ending-online-support-for-need-for-speed-rivals-in-october-2025.1240482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that online support for Need for Speed: Rivals will be ending later this year on October 7, 2025. The shutdown was spotted by <a href="https://delistedgames.com/ea-returns-today-to-announce-need-for-speed-rivals-will-lose-online-services-october-7th/">Delisted Games</a>, where a reader noticed Rivals had been added to <a href="https://www.ea.com/legal/service-updates/i-q#:~:text=N-,October%207%2C%202025,-NEED%20FOR%20SPEED">EA's list of games</a> that are getting their online services shutdown.</p>



<p>Need for Speed: Rivals launched over a decade ago, on November 15, 2013, and originally launched for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, before coming to Xbox One and PS4 a year later in October 2014. The shutdown of online services is for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game, meaning that players on those devices and on current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, will no longer be able to play any of the game's online modes after October 7, 2025.</p>



<p>Racing against other players online is the core driving factor for why most racing fans play racing games, Need for Speed included, but at least in the case of Rivals, there is still an offline mode for players to dig into, if they want to revisit Rivals after October 7. But that's not the case for several online-focused games that have been shut down recently, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/">Anthem</a>, which EA recently announced will have its online functionality shut down in early 2026, effectively making the game unplayable.</p>



<p>Games like Anthem essentially being taken away from players is at the crux of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, which is trying to get legislation passed that prohibits developers and publishers from taking away rights that they sold to players at the point of the game's purchase. </p>



<p>The campaign began last year and has recently been a hot topic of discussion regarding game preservation, as the petition recently surpassed 1 million signatures. In response, several of the video game industry's biggest publishers and developers, many of whom pull in hundreds of millions of dollars each year, some of them even billions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/">claimed that the proposals made by Stop Killing Games, if accepted</a>, would make creating online-focused games "<em>prohibitively expensive</em>."</p>



<p>Minecraft creator Markus Persson, commonly known as Notch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-creator-buying-game-purchase-pirating-not-theft/">also recently weighed in on the campaign</a>, saying "<em>If buying a game is not a purchase, then pirating them is not theft</em>," referencing the argument from publishers that players don't actually buy games at the point of purchase, but a license to play them until such time that publisher decides players don't get that privilege any more. </p>

			<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is yet another game like<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-has-been-in-development-since-the-launch-of-the-first-switch-console/"> Mario Kart World</a> whose development began on the original Nintendo Switch, but development was moved on to the Nintendo Switch 2, as the core mechanics' best implementation could only be possible on the new generation system.</p>



<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with&nbsp;IGN, Producer Kento Motokura and Director Kazuya Takahashi confirmed that the game development began on Nintendo's previous generation system. At the time, the development team was still using voxel technology and going over different ideas for applications, but as soon as they received news of the Nintendo Switch 2 development, they realized that the best implementation of the game's core mechanics would be on the new generation system.</p>



<p>According to Takashi-san, the continuity of destruction, which is an important part of the Donkey Kong Bananza experience, could be expanded on the Nintendo Switch 2. The system allowed the developer to create a rich variety of materials and very large-scale changes in the environment. Besides the system's better specifications, what really appealed to the development team were other features the Nintendo Switch 2 offered, like mouse controls, which can be used in co-op play.</p>



<p>During the interview, the Donkey Kong Bananza producer and director also went over how the game and its central mechanics came to be. The idea for the development of a Donkey Kong 3D game came from Yoshiaki Koizumi, Super Mario Odyssey producer and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat director, a prospect that prompted the team to get to learn more about the character from Shigeru Miyamoto, what makes him unique, and explore how these distinctive features could define a new game. Ultimately, the experiments with voxel technology featured in Super Mario Odyssey gave the development team the idea of destruction as a core mechanic, which worked well together with Donkey Kong's defining features.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on July 17 on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">preview</a>.</p>
